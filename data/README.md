**Barbie Movie Articles - Data**  
--
_For now it's just preliminary data_

**Issues**
- NewsApi
     - Only fetches data in the last month (either we stick with this API but choose a more recent movie that came out or we change APIs)  
     - Only fetches 100 articles 
      
- Mediastack
  - Can change start date but end date is 1 month after (can play around with maybe getting month before vs after release of movie)   
  - Only fetches 100 articles
