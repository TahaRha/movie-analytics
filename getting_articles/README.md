Yianni's collection script usage
python collection_script.py ['your api key'] query_prompts.txt -o ../data/['outfilename']

Edit the query prompts text or create your own
the script will query newsapi with all of your queries and combine them into one df saved to your desired destination.
I have created a first set at /data/barbiemovie_v1.csv
