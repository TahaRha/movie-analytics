        "text": "New York CNN —\n\nIt’s a tale of two movies and a box office triumph: “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” maintained incredible momentum into their second weekends.\n\n“Barbie” wore several hats this weekend, with domestic “Barbie” impressing with $93 million in gross revenue and international “Barbie” bringing in around $122 million, making it the No. 1 release worldwide.\n\nIt is the largest domestic second weekend performance ever for Warner Bros., which distributed the movie. (CNN and Warner Bros. are both owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n\n“Oppenheimer” also had a blowout weekend, with a domestic total of $46 million, according to estimates from media analytics company Comscore, bringing its worldwide total to almost half a billion dollars. Universal, which distributed the movie, estimated Oppenheimer will be Nolan’s biggest non-superhero film of all-time in 40 regions, and his biggest film ever in 28.\n\nCrucially, these numbers reflect that not only is there high energy and excitement for movies, but an appetite for the movie theater experience.\n\nPeople dress up as the doll Barbie to attend the Barbie movie on July 21, 2023 in New York City. Stephanie Keith/Getty Images\n\n“Barbenheimer was never going to happen on your TV, it’s just not,” said Michael O’Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theater Owners in the United States. “You have to go into the theater to experience it.”\n\nRepeat viewings are also fueling box office earnings. Midwest-based chain B&B Theaters estimated that across its 55 theaters, more than 2,100 people saw “Barbie” both opening weekend and this weekend, and almost 500 returned to see “Oppenheimer.”\n\n“Hollywood” is often considered interchangeable with “the movie industry,” and O’Leary notes that there has always been a strong movie theater culture in the United States.\n\nAfter the pandemic ravaged theaters and public screenings, people are now looking forward to “sitting in a theater with world-class projection and sound systems, having an immersive experience alongside other people,” he said.\n\n“Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” will trigger more and more people going to the movies by reminding them “the best of what the theatrical experience can be. It’s a reawakening,” he added.\n\nA fake doctor's note posted by movie theater chain B&B Theaters, excusing theatergoers from other commitments until they've seen both \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" on July 21, 2023. bbtheatres/Instagram\n\nO’Leary expects the movies to perform well for weeks to come, noting there’s been a rise over the past several years in very strong holdover weekends. That could be partly due to energetic word-of-mouth stoked by social media.\n\n“At their core, consumers want to go see a compelling story, they want to be entertained,” he said. “If stories resonate with people… they tell other people.”\n\nThe overwhelming appreciation for these creative projects means that the ongoing Writers Guild of America and actors union SAG-AFTRA strikes could be a dark cloud over the these financial successes, according to some analysts.\n\n“There’s pressure to resolve (these labor disputes) because the possibility of revenue is built on the foundation of having movies and actors to promote them,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. “For now we have high-profile films, but that pool will be drying out.”\n\nWriters Guild of America and Screen Actors Guild members with supporters on a picket line outside Fox Studios in Los Angeles on July 21, 2023. Eric Thayer/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe production limbo caused by a lack of negotiations on the part of studios are leading to a ripple effect where the release dates for those projects will also be postponed. According to Boxoffice Pro chief analyst Shawn Robbins, this means that in the second half of 2023 and throughout 2024, theater chains will need “to keep a weather eye on the horizon for problems beyond their control.”\n\n“While it’s important to celebrate the good times right now and realize they can be a barometer for the future, it’s just as important to recognize the fight for equality by so many who play a part in creating the content we see on our screens, large and small,” he added."

        "text": "The Warner Bros. Film Group in the U.S. has made a public apology about social media activity concerning the “Barbenheimer” meme that has caused major offence in Japan.\n\n“Warner Brothers regrets its recent insensitive social media engagement. The studio offers a sincere apology,” the company said in a statement emailed to Variety on Tuesday.\n\nThe move follows criticism of Warner by members of the public in Japan, the start of an online petition against the studio and an unusual maneuver by the Japanese distribution arm of Warner.\n\nWarner Bros. Japan on Monday posted a statement on its official Japanese-language “Barbie” Twitter account criticizing the studio’s U.S. branch for feeding into the “Barbenheimer” craze on social media. The “Barbie” U.S. Twitter account has positively interacted with some fan posts about “Barbenheimer,” which refers to the dual summer releases of Universal’s “Oppenheimer” and Warner Bros.’ “Barbie” movies. Both movies were released on July 21 in North America and many international territories and became box office juggernauts. Together, they boosted the box office to its fourth highest-grossing weekend in history during their debut outings.\n\n“Oppenheimer” has not been released in Japan and no release date has yet been determined. While the film debates the issue of whether the bombings ultimately saved lives and brought international peace, the latest skirmish underlines the continuing sensitivity of the nuclear weapons debate in Japan. By some estimates, as many as 250,000 people were killed by the two atomic bombs dropped by the U.S. on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.\n\n“We consider it extremely regrettable that the official account of the American headquarters for the movie ‘Barbie’ reacted to the social media postings of ‘Barbenheimer’ fans,” Warner Bros. Japan wrote in a statement published on the “Barbie” Japan Twitter profile. “We take this situation very seriously. We are asking the U.S. headquarters to take appropriate action. We apologize to those who were offended by this series of inconsiderate reactions. Warner Bros Japan.”\n\nResponding to one “Barbenheimer” fan art poster which depicts Margot Robbie’s Barbie sitting on the shoulders of Cillian Murphy’s J. Robert Oppenheimer in front of a fiery atomic mushroom cloud, the “Barbie” U.S. Twitter account wrote, “It’s going to be a summer to remember.” Twitter, now called X, added a community note to the post explaining the historical context of the mushroom cloud image.\n\n“At 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945 (Showa 20), an atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima for the first time in human history,” the Twitter note reads. “The particular nature of the damage caused by the atomic bombs is that mass destruction and mass murder occurred instantaneously and indiscriminately.”\n\nThe “Barbenheimer” craze has drawn criticism in Japan for making light of the mass destruction caused by the atomic bombs. The hashtag #NoBarbenheimer has trended in the country in recent days."

        "text": "It was only supposed to be a meme. And yet, if you made it out to the cinema this weekend – having most likely pre-booked your tickets, rapidly becoming gold dust as entire picturehouses sold out – you’ll have seen foyers flooded with people doing the most (seemingly) deranged double-bill of recent memory: Christopher Nolan’s soul-rattling atomic bomb creation story Oppenheimer, and Greta Gerwig’s fuchsia fantasia toy story Barbie. There were pink outfits galore. There were countless discussions of the ideal viewing order. There were celebratory t-shirts designed specifically for the event. And it all came under one ridiculous name: ‘Barbenheimer’.\n\nThe result has been box office dynamite. Already, Barbie has made $344 million worldwide, with a record-breaking $162 million debut in the States – giving Greta Gerwig the mantle of highest-grossing opening weekend for a female director. And Oppenheimer – a three-hour, often black-and-white historical political drama – was caught up in the chain reaction, earning over $174 million, with IMAX cinemas now sold out weeks in advance. It all adds up to the biggest box office weekend since Avengers: Endgame arrived in 2019, this time split across two non-franchise, non-superhero, non-typical juggernauts.\n\nIt’s not the first time a viral trend has made the leap from internet gag to IRL phenomenon – last year saw Gen Z go wild for ‘GentleMinions’, where another seemingly ridiculous idea (dress up in your finest suits to celebrate the belated return of those sentient yellow Tic Tacs in Minions: The Rise Of Gru) resulted in major turnouts at the multiplex. ‘Barbenheimer’ began from a similarly ‘Wouldn’t it be funny if…’ notion, when film fans discovered that Nolan’s deeply serious A-bomb biopic was launching on the same day as Gerwig’s deeply unserious plastic-fantastic comedy; the notion of seeing both in quick succession seemed inherently hilarious.\n\nIt went from a notion that was merely pleasantly ridiculous, to pleasantly ridiculous and an absolute must-do.\n\nAnd yet, somewhere along the way, that idea mutated, gained traction. Maybe it was the way the memed designs – a figure, half-Barbie half-Oppenheimer, donning a hat; ‘Oppenheimer’ written in the Barbie font – quickly became purchasable items, morphing from a digital running joke into something tangible and real-world, as did the concept of actually seeing both on the same day. Perhaps it was the way that it encroached on the press tour for each film: Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie posed with their Oppenheimer cinema ticket (sparked by Mission: Impossible’s Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise; notably, the trend didn’t become ‘Barbenheimpossible’), while Christopher Nolan called the notion of doing the double a “great” one. Like Margot Robbie’s Barbie herself – and, for that matter, Oppenheimer’s atomic bomb – what began as a mere idea soon became real.\n\nSurely contributing to the ‘Barbenheimer’ blowout is that both films received excellent reviews – after weeks of omnipresent Barbie marketing, a thunderous Oppenheimer campaign, and all the accompanying Barben-hype, the critical consensus for both Gerwig and Nolan’s films was rapturously positive. And while strong reviews don’t always equal strong box office, it had a catalytic effect here – evolving the conversation once more from the notion that you could watch both in a day, to the idea that you should; that each film stands as a triumph from a distinctive directorial voice, and that for all their seeming differences, to watch both back-to-back would mean seeing two of the best movies of the year across one single super-sized, super-cinematic outing. It went from a notion that was merely pleasantly ridiculous, to pleasantly ridiculous and an absolute must-do.\n\nAs the idea snowballed – the realisation that people really were going to see both spurring others on to do the same – it soon became clear that Barbie and Oppenheimer make for a surprisingly great double bill. The Day-Glo colours and wacky comedy of Barbie and the intense atmosphere of doom of Oppenheimer don’t just weirdly complement each other; in Gerwig’s (and co-writer Noah Baumbach’s) hands, Barbie itself contrasts its gleaming surfaces with deep explorations of existential ideas. They are both, oddly, about reckoning with our purpose in life; about interrogating the (destructive) role of men in society; about bridging the chasm between ideas and reality. Just, one does it with neon rollerblades and a Dua Lipa disco track. And they’re both big-screen must-sees – distinctive examples of impeccable filmmaking craft, delivering undeniable cinematic spectacle in a different way to the usual fight sequences of a summer blockbuster.\n\nThe cumulative effect of Barbenheimer created the very thing that Hollywood has perhaps struggled to conjure in recent years: the sense of an all-out cinematic event. It was one that people actively wanted to be part of: to contribute to the conversation of whether you’d seen one, or both; to share stories of how busy it was in the cinema; to see the most-hyped releases of the year in packed houses, all laughing together at Barbie’s most uproarious jokes, or in a shared sense of deep terror at Oppenheimer’s bomb blast. You really did have to be there – of everything to do in the world this weekend, being at your local cinema was the #1 destination. It’s a rare but wonderful occurrence, most recently felt with Endgame’s ‘see it before anyone else spoils it’ excitement, or Parasite’s ‘no, this is really one of the best and most enthralling thrillers you’ll have seen in years’ dismantling of the one-inch-tall subtitle barrier (as director Bong Joon-Ho put it).\n\nAnd that’s where cinemas have really won this weekend: whether driven by memes, by reviews, or by a simple desire to be involved, people have flocked to their local movie-houses this weekend, and probably had their best experience there in years. The lessons Hollywood takes from it remain to be seen – a Barbenheimer likely can’t be manufactured, nor is it a simple case of counter-programming, nor necessarily a signal that audiences want more movies based on historic toy brands or, um, weapons of mass destruction. Perhaps it’s a sign that sequels aren’t the be-all and end-all anymore. Perhaps it’s an indication that allowing talented filmmakers to take major risks and marketing them properly is the way forward. Perhaps people just wanted to wear pink and have fun – and who can blame them? But for whatever reason audiences entered their Barbie and Oppenheimer screenings, they likely left with a greater appreciation of the cinema experience. Your move, Hollywood."

In fact, both films' ticket sales fell just 43% from their opening weekends.\n\nTypically, blockbuster features will see ticket sales fall between 50% and 70% after the debut weekend. Second week numbers are often looked at by box office analysts as an indicator of whether a film will have longevity at the box office or will fizzle quickly. The smaller the drop, the better.\n\n\"'Barbenheimer' will go down as one of the most notable and unforeseeable milestones in the history of cinema not just for what it means to the bottom-line box office dollars for the industry but also as a cultural event centered around moviegoing,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.\n\nOver the weekend, \"Barbie\" added $93 million, bringing its domestic haul to $351 million. The Greta Gerwig and Mattel collaboration for Warner Bros. is nearing $800 million worldwide and could become the second billion-dollar film of 2023.\n\nUniversal 's \"Oppenheimer,\" meanwhile, tallied another $46.7 million over the weekend. Its domestic gross now stands at $175 million. Globally, it's generated $405 million.\n\n\"For a domestic summer marketplace desperately in need of a box office boost, the July 21 simultaneous theatrical debuts of 'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' set off a chain reaction of overall box office that has infused the all-important season with nearly three quarters of a billion dollars of bonus cash,\" Dergarabedian said.\n\nHeading into \"Barbenheimer's\" first weekend, the summer box office, which runs from the first weekend in May through Labor Day, was down around 7% compared to 2022. Two weeks later, it's up 9%, according to data from Comscore.\n\nSimilarly, the confluence of these two films boosted the overall domestic box office compared with last year's haul to this point. Prior to \"Barbenheimer,\" ticket sales were up 12%. Two weeks later, they were up 20%.\n\nThe overall domestic box office still lags behind prepandemic levels by around 16%, however. And prospects for catching up are dwindling as studios have started to move big releases to next year as Hollywood digs in for drawn-out writers' and actors' strikes.\n\nDisclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC. NBCUniversal is the distributor of \"Oppenheimer.\""

        "text": "Tom Cruise, the star who is credited with saving the box office after Top Gun: Maverick flew to $1.5 billion in global ticket sales, is now facing another kind of reckoning — surviving the Barbenheimer effect.\n\nHis Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One tumbled a franchise-worst 64 percent to $19.5 million in its second weekend when going up against Barbie and Oppenheimer, whose dual arrivals transformed into a cultural phenomenon and propelled the domestic box office to historic heights. Revenue for the July 21-23 weekend was the fourth-biggest of all time; in addition, it was the first time ever that one movie opened to $100 million or more and another to $50 million or more. Barbie scored $155 million, followed by $80.5 million for Oppenheimer. No one in Hollywood anticipated such a staggering turnout.\n\nThe seventh installment in Paramount and Skydance’s storied Mission: Impossible series, which finished Sunday with a domestic total of $118.8 million, had hoped to earn as much as $25 million in its second outing.\n\nThe question now is whether Dead Reckoning Part One can level out and enjoy a long run as other series installments have done, and just as Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick did. Executives across Hollywood, and not just at Paramount, aren’t ruling Dead Reckoning out just yet, especially since it has a better critics’ score on Rotten Tomatoes than Barbie and Oppenheimer, as well as strong audience exit scores.\n\n“I don’t think the story has yet been written,” says one executive at a rival studio.\n\nMission: Impossible pics have never sported mega-openings, yet expectations were high for Dead Reckoning after Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick opened to $160.5 million over Memorial Day weekend in 2022, including $126.7 million for the three days. Dead Reckoning had been tracking to open to $90 million in its first five days beginning July 12; instead, it took in a franchise-best $78.5 million, not adjusted for inflation.\n\nTitles in the Mission franchise have always drawn a larger percentage of their global gross from the foreign box office. Dead Reckoning Part One is no exception. It earned another $55 million from 72 markets in its second weekend for a foreign tally of $252.1 million and $370.9 million globally through Sunday. It is doing especially well in Asia, where Barbie and Oppenheimer aren’t strong players. And in a number of markets, it is pacing 15 percent or more ahead of 2018’s Mission: Impossible — Fallout. In Japan, it debuted to $7.9 million, 23 percent ahead of Fallout, which earned a franchise-best $571.5 million overseas for a global total of $791.7 million, including $220.2 million in North America.\n\nMission: Impossible 7 had to contend with losing Imax screens for three weeks to Oppenheimer, in addition to losing premium large-format screens to both Oppenheimer and Barbie. The upcharge for Imax and PLFs is significant and can have a big impact on the bottom line. In early July, Imax screens were dedicated to Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.\n\nCruise’s latest movie, directed by Christopher McQuarrie, cost nearly $300 million to produce and saw its release date delayed numerous times because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was initially set to open in summer of 2021, then summer or fall of 2022. Its release date ultimately landed on mid-July of this year, a date dictated by the shooting schedule of Dead Reckoning Part Two and Cruise’s availability to promote Part One (the actor is known for his global marketing efforts).\n\nAdds another observer: “Barbenheimer siphoned off MI7′s potential this weekend, with Oppenheimer drawing older males away from Dead Reckoning. Not only that, Sound of Freedom is an unexpected force to be reckoned with and is presenting competition from an unlikely source.”\n\nEstimates for the U.S. box office show Angel Studios’ faith-based political thriller Sound of Freedom beating Dead Reckoning for the weekend with $20.1 million for a cume of $123.4 million (Sound of Freedom opened July 4), according to Comscore. Paramount and other studios show Dead Reckoning beating Sound of Freedom; Monday actuals will determine the order.\n\nMission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part Two is set to open in theaters June 28, 2024. McQuarrie and Cruise have shot much of the movie, but production is now halted because of the SAG-AFTRA strike in another moment of reckoning for the storied action franchise.\n\nThings looked different in late June, when Cruise — Hollywood’s highest-profile advocate for the theatrical experience — urged audiences to see Dial of Destiny. And, yes, two other movies in a surprisingly effective plea. Wrote the actor on Instagram : “I love a double feature, and it doesn’t get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig’s Barbie.”"

        "text": "Warner Bros.’ “Barbie” and Universal’s “Oppenheimer” continued their domination of the U.K. and Ireland box office with a combined £21.4 million ($27.3 million) after their second weekend, per numbers from Comscore.\n\nGreta Gerwig’s “Barbie” topped the charts for the second week in a row with £13.2 million, and now has a total of £47.9 million. The film is expected to surpass Universal’s “The Super Mario Bros.

Learn more about the opportunities here.\n\nA new AI-generated movie trailer that splices together the wildly-hyped movies Barbie and Oppenheimer into a mashup — featuring a pink mushroom cloud — has gone viral.\n\nThe trailer offers a spot-on sendup on the “Barbenheimer” hype that had moviegoers flocking to see both movies back-to-back, even though the two films couldn’t be more different — Oppenheimer is a sober biopic about the life and legacy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, father of the atomic bomb, while Barbie is a fizzy, feminist, live-action look at the famous doll.\n\n>>Don’t miss our special issue: The Future of the data center: Handling greater and greater demands.<<\n\nPowered by image generation AI Midjourney and movie generator Runway Gen2 and featuring AI-generated voices supposedly belonging to Margot Robbie and Matt Damon, the “Barbenheimer” crossover took just four days to make, according to the creator’s Reddit post, where he shared a link to his course on AI filmmaking.\n\nVB Event The AI Impact Tour Connect with the enterprise AI community at VentureBeat’s AI Impact Tour coming to a city near you! Learn More\n\nBut as a reporter covering AI’s cheerful, bullish, even fluffy side as well as its serious, sobering side, I can’t help but think about three things the AI-generated ‘Barbenheimer’ movie trailer says about the state of generative AI right now.\n\n1. AI-generated entertainment is moving fast — perfect for today’s viral moments.\n\nSo, it’s no surprise that as the Barbenheimer hype rocketed upward, any online content-maker could jump on board with their own quick-and-dirty AI-generated take to share across social platforms. A traditional ad agency couldn’t possibly move fast enough to pull off the same kind of “Barbenheimer” sendup to meet the moment, and the costs would be prohibitive enough that they likely wouldn’t even try.\n\nIn an era when social media content is part of the zeitgeist more than ever, there’s no doubt that the speed of development of AI-generated entertainment is perfectly placed for today’s viral moments. Back in March, for example, a Reddit user shared an AI-generated video of Will Smith eating spaghetti on the r/StableDiffusion subreddit. It quickly spread on social media as well as the mainstream press, with one article saying the video “would haunt you for the rest of your life.”\n\n2. The ‘Barbenheimer’ trailer comes as creatives strike and regulators play AI catchup.\n\nHollywood has come nearly to a halt in recent weeks, with SAG-AFTRA actors and writers currently on strike and expressing particular concerns about the impact of gen AI on their industry and jobs. The “Barbenheimer” trailer is a perfect example: Who needs the pricey services of Margot Robbie and Matt Damon if you can come up with a serviceable AI copy? Why use the time-consuming work of artists or editors when you have the speedy output of Midjourney and Runway Gen 2?\n\nAt the same time, AI-focused creatives who are excited by the possibilities of gen AI are going full-steam ahead — even as regulators and policy-makers sprint to catch up. The Senate will be schooled in AI this fall with an eye towards a foundation for developing regulations in 2024. Will that be too little, too late?\n\n3. The current generative AI hype may just be a candy-colored wrapper around a more serious, unsettling reality.\n\nThe AI-generated Barbenheimer trailer is, in my opinion, funny and adorable. But the idea that you could wrap one of history’s most horrifying periods — the development of the atomic bomb during World War II, which led to the death of hundreds of thousands at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 — in a candy-colored Barbie wrapper and a pink mushroom cloud is equal parts stunning and shocking.\n\nThat’s gen AI in a nutshell — stunning and shocking, exciting and frightening, dazzling and appalling, sometimes all at once. But certainly, all stakeholders involved in AI development need to consider not just the sugary surface of what gen AI can do, but the deep, real issues that lay underneath."

        "text": "Rafu Wire Service and Staff Reports\n\nWarner Bros. has issued an apology in response to a controversy over popular memes combining two movies — “Barbie,” based on Mattel’s line of dolls, and “Oppenheimer,” a historical drama about the development of the atomic bomb.\n\nAn example of a meme combining “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer.”\n\nSince the movies have topped the box office in the U.S. since their release on July 21, media reports encouraging viewers to see both, on the same day if possible, have coined the term “Barbenheimer.”\n\nThe cheerful memes combine Margot Robbie as Barbie with Cillian Murphy as physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, often with a mushroom cloud in the background. One meme showed Barbie with a mushroom-cloud hairstyle.\n\nWarner Bros.’ initial response to the mashups was positive. “Barbie” is distributed by Warner Bros. and “Oppenheimer” by Universal.\n\nAfter receiving criticism on July 31 from Warner Bros. Japan LLC, Warner Bros. Film Group said in a statement, “Warner Brothers regrets its recent insensitive social media engagement. The studio offers a sincere apology.”\n\nWarner Bros Japan’s statement read, in part, “Because the movies ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ were both released in America on July 21, there is currently a movement driven by overseas fans to watch them together (#Barbenheimer), but this is not an official movement. We find the reaction to this fan-driven movement from the official American account for the movie ‘Barbie’ to be extremely regrettable.”\n\nYoung activists in Japan on Aug. 1 launched a petition urging the distributors of the hit movies to disavow the “Barbenheimer” hashtag, saying that it is a “clear indication that there is a widespread lack of awareness about the atrocities of atomic bombing” and that the social media activity “completely disregards the suffering of atomic bomb victims and survivors.”\n\n“Barbie” is slated for release in Japan on Aug. 11, just days after the 78th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on Aug. 6 and 9, respectively. A Japanese release date for “Oppenheimer” has yet to be scheduled.\n\nAlthough “Oppenheimer” depicts the testing of the first atomic bomb in the New Mexico desert, the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not shown.\n\nAnother film about the development of the A-bomb, “Fat Man and Little Boy” (1989), with Dwight Schultz as Oppenheimer, also depicted the testing of the first bomb but not the effects of “Little Boy” and “Fat Man” (the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively).\n\nA number of Japanese films have been made about the horrors of the atomic bombings, including Shohei Imamura’s “Black Rain” (1989), based on the novel by Masuji Ibuse, and the animated feature “Barefoot Gen” (1983), based on the manga by Keiji Nakazawa.\n\nMiho Tanaka, 28, one of the activists behind the signature campaign, said she felt “a mixture of anger, sadness and resignation” upon seeing the memes.\n\n“I feel like atomic bomb survivors have experienced things like this many times, but even so, I felt I don’t want them to have to see these images,” she said.\n\nTanaka, however, said that the campaign has no problem with the existence of an Oppenheimer film, and she expressed admiration that the story could be the subject of popular art.\n\n“I was really surprised the U.S., Hollywood no less, could produce a film like that and show it domestically. That it could make a film that would create debate about nuclear weapons is a great thing,” she said.\n\nIn Los Angeles, anti-nuclear activist Tsukuru Fors posted one of the memes on social media and said, “Jokes and memes that are being made about the movies ‘Barbie’ & ‘Oppenheimer’ are not OK. I don’t need to tell you; I hope it is obvious. It is great that people are ‘excited’ about ‘Oppenheimer.’ I hope that people will go see the movie and that it will somehow motivate them to advocate for the abolishment of nuclear weapons. (Neither the U.S. nor Japanese government has signed/ratified the TPNW, Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.)\n\n“I just think that this insensitivity is what happens when the voices/stories of the victims are conveniently eliminated/hidden away from the narrative. That is why it is my/our job to amplify the voices/stories of the victims whenever possible. I owe it to the people of Hiroshima, who gave me the sense of belonging in my formative, teenage years. I owe it to 350 young girls at my high school who lost their lives on Aug. 6, 1945.\n\n“The A-bomb of Hiroshima and Nagasaki collectively took more than 200,000 lives within a few months. Many had to witness their loved ones die in front of their eyes. In fact, many had to leave their loved ones behind while they screamed for help. Many could not find the remains of their loved ones, because they either instantly evaporated, incinerated, or turned unrecognizable.\n\n“The A-bombs caused intergenerational traumas that affect people to this day. And let’s not forget that nuclear atrocities neither began nor ended with Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Please remember hibakusha (victims of nuclear atrocities worldwide) …\n\n“This summer, please go and seek out the stories told in the victims’ voices. Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum has an excellent online database where you can find drawings by survivors, which would leave you overwhelmed but give you the sense of the gravity of the atrocity ….\n\n“I know that some people are so excited about the movies and want to tell the world to go and watch them both, but these jokes and memes are NOT the way to do it.”"

        "text": "German epidemiologists are warning of a summer wave of coronavirus infections, blaming in part mass gatherings such as the Barbenheimer double feature craze.\n\nThe government’s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), says that while infections remain low compared with at the height of the pandemic, they have been on the rise for the past month.\n\nAccording to the government’s Pandemic Radar, which is updated daily by the health ministry, visits to the doctor due to a Covid 19 infection are up 175% on the previous week, and there have been 2,400 cases reported to the RKI this week compared with 400 the previous week, and double the rate of a month ago.\n\nHospital admissions of people with coronavirus are up 50%. More than half of Germany’s monitoring stations, in particular sewage plants, have indicated a rise in viral load detected in wastewater this month.\n\nThe number of official test results shows the rate to be low, at 3 in every 100,000 people. However, the figure itself is hardly a reflection of the real rate, as so few tests are being carried out.\n\n“It could be that we’re having a summer wave,” Timo Ulrichs an epidemiologist at the Berlin Akkon University of Human Sciences, told the news portal Spiegel, adding that the so-called “Barbenheimer effect” was capable of boosting the numbers.\n\nGermany was among the countries where cinemagoers were encouraged to go to watch the blockbuster films Barbie and Oppenheimer as a double feature, in an effort to boost cinema attendance which has yet to recover since the pandemic. So far just under 4 million have seen Barbie, and more than 2.5 million Oppenheimer.\n\nThe idea of a Barbenheimer effect on the spread of the virus was first playfully mooted by the vaccine expert Peter Hotez of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.\n\nSuggesting on Twitter that it might be of concern, due to the millions of people surging to cinemas and spending hours in a windowless room together, he concluded: “We’ll probably never know since no one seems to be keeping track of such things any more.”\n\nNew York has recently recorded a doubling in hospitalisations due to the EG.5 Eris variant of Omicron, which the World Health Organization last week classified as a “variant of interest”.\n\nHotez urged people to keep up with their boosters and wear a pink medical mask – in a nod to Barbie – if they were planning a cinema visit.\n\nGermany’s health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said in reaction to rising levels elsewhere in the world, and the increase in Germany, where the XBB.1.5 variant is currently responsible for most new infections: “our early warning system is activated”.\n\nGermans are being encouraged to get booster jabs in the autumn, if they belong to a higher-risk group, such as those over 60, and people who are overweight, suffer from a lung disease such as COPD, or work in a risky environment such as a hospital. Those who are sick are being advised to stay at home."

Perfected down to the minute details, it solidifies the film as director Christopher Nolan’s best, and perhaps his most insurmountable.\n\nHere’s Nick Schager’s take:\n\n“Christopher Nolan’s cinema is one of dualities: between knowledge and ignorance (Memento); seeing and sightlessness (Insomnia); good and evil (The Dark Knight); illusion and authenticity (The Prestige); dreaming and waking (Inception); courage and cowardice (Dunkirk); and the past and the present (Tenet). In that regard, Oppenheimer—a film of endless contrasts and contradictions—is the fullest expression of the writer/director’s artistry to date.\n\nPropelled by the inexorable march of progress and imagination and electrified by the terrible thrill of theories, dreams, and miracles realized in all their devastating glory, it’s a divided epic of awe and horror, fission and fusion. It’s simultaneously a unified portrait of a conflicted man and a singular achievement for Hollywood’s reigning blockbuster auteur.\n\nAdapted from Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning 2005 biography American Prometheus, Oppenheimer (July 21, in theaters) begins with images of raindrops falling on a pond’s surface and fiery detonations in the void—the first of innumerable opposing visions that are in unlikely harmony, or at least uneasy coexistence, in Nolan’s masterpiece.\n\nAn individual of myriad paradoxes, Cillian Murphy’s J. Robert Oppenheimer is a scientist (and the father of theoretical physics in the United States) who adores art and culture; a towering intellectual who’s incompetent in the laboratory; an arrogant leader who’s unwilling to fight; a devoted lover and partner who’s habitually unfaithful; and the architect of modern annihilation who wants to foster global peace. When, early in his academic career, he’s drawn to quantum physics, because it suggests that the impossible—namely, that light is both a wave and a particle—is true, it’s a telling snapshot of his inherent attraction to the irreconcilable.”\n\nRead more.\n\nSee: Barbie\n\nBarbie makes the plastic way more than just fantastic; Greta Gewig’s film reaches new heights for mainstream cinema, proving that it’s not necessary to sacrifice a story’s empathetic soul just because its main character comes in a box.\n\nHere’s Coleman Spilde’s take:\n\n“With all of the chatter regarding the Barbie movie for the last four years, the most pressing question has ended up being whether Greta Gerwig’s film could exceed the insurmountable hype surrounding it. There was an influx of candid set photos, multiple trailers and pre-release clips, and massively popular memes that quickly created a level of fatigue that was just as ubiquitous as the Barbie poster generator. Barbie was a sensation long before we were close enough to see the radiant pink glow of its looming July 21 release date. Surely, no matter how good the film was, it could never fully live up to that amount of sheer anticipation.\n\nBut to settle for tempered expectations is simply not the Barbie way. Barbie can be a doctor, a CEO, a politician, and even a damn mermaid. The sky's the limit for Barbie—scratch that; she’ll become an astronaut and defy that restriction too. With all of these achievements under Barbie’s belt, who better to bring her story to the big screen than Gerwig? In her career as a writer and a director, Gerwig has crafted exceptional, singular films that brilliantly assess the subtleties of womanhood. No one is quite so adept at making the ultra-specific feel universal.”\n\nRead more.\n\nSkip: Futurama\n\nFuturama’s third reboot revives the iconic animated comedy for another blast through space and time, but the new season’s futurist satire of the 2020s often feels one-note, relying on references to the show’s substantially more impressive original run.\n\nHere’s Allegra Frank’s take:\n\n“Among the countless Simpsons jokes I think about on a near-constant basis, perhaps none comes to mind more often than ‘Moe gets a cell phone.’ In Season 13 of The Simpsons, the show was already well-aware of its own waning critical reception. It lampooned its longevity—which, 21 seasons later, has only become even more surprising—with a self-mocking song performed by NRBQ about how ‘they’ll never stop the Simpsons’: ‘Have no fears, we’ve got stories for years,’ it goes. ‘Like Marge becomes a robot! Maybe Moe gets a cell phone! Has Bart ever owned a bear?’\n\n‘Moe gets a cell phone’ is a wildly threadbare premise for an episode, but if The Simpsons were to continue forever, threadbare premises would have to do. All three of the joking predictions in that song have since come true; Moe got himself a flip phone, and Bart prank-texted him on it. For as often as fans try to argue that The Simpsons is ‘still good,’ ‘They’ll Never Stop the Simpsons’ became not a joke, but an ironic prophecy—a testament to how a good thing doesn’t need to live forever. This was top of mind as I watched Hulu’s reboot of Futurama, The Simpsons’ sister series and perhaps the most immortal television show of the 21st century.”\n\nRead more.\n\nSee: Harley Quinn Season 4\n\nHarley Quinn Season 4 takes the off-the-wall animated series further than ever. The show’s gloriously cheeky nature still pops with this season’s raunchy humor, but it's Harley’s search for personal growth that makes the series more than just vulgar hilarity.\n\nHere’s Laura Bradley’s take:\n\n“All around the Bat Cave in Harley Quinn, you’ll find details designed to remind you of the Bat Family’s one rule. The pillowcase, the WiFi password, and even the singing fish on the wall all want observers to remember that in this crew, ‘We Don’t Kill.’ As reasonable an edict as that might be for a group of vigilantes, and as reformed as the Joker’s former sidekick has become, that demand proves difficult for our newly minted ‘hero.’\n\nWhen she first embraced her main-character energy at the start of Harley Quinn, Kaley Cuoco’s pigtailed harlequin wanted nothing more than to become the empress of darkness—or, at least, a card-carrying Legion of Doom member. By the end of Season 3, however, she’d switched sides to fight with the good guys, even as her girlfriend, Poison Ivy (Lake Bell) took over the villainous group as CEO. Now, as Season 4 kicks off with four episodes on Max starting July 27, the couple’s professional goals could not be further apart.”\n\nRead more.\n\nSign up for our See Skip newsletter here to find out which new shows and movies are worth watching, and which aren’t."

        "text": "“Barbie” arrived as a full-blown cultural event, with thousands of moviegoers draping themselves in pink for screenings, doll memes flooding social media and marketers scrambling (sometimes awkwardly) to glom onto the moment. The audience was 65 percent female. “For a film this pink, you would have expected the audience to be closer to 90 percent female — we got a ton of guys,” said Jeff Goldstein, president of domestic distribution at Warner Bros. “It exploded everywhere: large markets, small markets, coast to coast.”\n\nImage Harrison Hood, 24, arrived at the AMC Kips Bay theater in Manhattan wearing “Barbie” regalia. Credit... Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times\n\nSome theaters seemed to be caught off guard. One high-end theater in the Washington, D.C. suburbs went all out on promotion, with pink lights to highlight “Barbie” and a wall of movie posters featuring both films. But the theater may have miscalculated Saturday attendance. By the 10 p.m. showing, it had run out of multiple food items. It also lacked soft drinks and, amazingly, ice.\n\nAnother theater in Arlington, Va., had it worse: The air conditioning went out, leading to a sweltering experience. While the theater offered refunds, many ticket buyers stayed.\n\nThe question now is whether Hollywood can keep the momentum going. Studio executives have long pointed out that moviegoing begets moviegoing — that the habit of watching movies in theaters is crucial. Coming up, however, studios are facing another crisis: A strike by unionized actors, which started on July 14, could force movie companies to push back coming films because striking stars cannot take part in publicity campaigns. “Challengers,” a sports drama involving a love triangle and starring Zendaya, has already been pushed from September to April.\n\nThere are no talks scheduled between SAG-AFTRA, as the actors’ union is known, and studios.\n\n“Oppenheimer” helped fuel “Barbie” and vice versa, with their simultaneous release nicknamed Barbenheimer and movie fans captivated by their wild incongruity. Nolan’s film, which cost Universal Pictures at least $100 million to make, not including a megawatt marketing campaign, is a three-hour period drama about Robert Oppenheimer, the man known as “the father of the atomic bomb.” About 200,000 people purchased tickets to see “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” as a double feature, according to the National Association of Theater Owners, a trade organization."

Citing data from Boxoffice Pro, Bloomberg Intelligence lowered its outlook for the theater industry's revenue by 2%, to about $8.9 billion.\n\nEarlier this month, the Screen Actors Guild announced a walkout after failing to reach a deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture & Television Producers. They joined the Writers Guild of America, which has been on strike since May.\n\n\"Actors are no longer promoting their movies, creating a demand headwind,\" JPMorgan's Karnovsky wrote. \"The impact of this is difficult to quantify and will vary based on the film, though the recent underperformance of The Flash highlights the importance of effective marketing. While we don't think the strike will impact demand in the very near term, we do see potential risk to films dated for late summer /early fall, which could have the compounding effect of slowing box office momentum ahead of 2024.\""

Fans have made double and triple trips to go watch the movie in theaters again and again. But some people around the world they're only now getting a chance to book their tickets to Barbieland. The Margot Robbie starrer is finally released in Japan, after a huge controversy related to Barbenheimer memes. Here's what happened.\n\nBarbie releases in Japan after Barbenheimer controversy\n\nTickets for Babrie are flying off the shelf in Japan. The Greta Gerwig Directorial, fortunately, clashed with a national holiday in Japan that marks the start of the extended summer holiday week in the country, prompting many people to go out for a movie night. The viral trend of \"Barbenheimer\" stirred controversy in Japan, as the country had recently commemorated the 78th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In the now-deleted post on Twitter, Warner Bros. marketing account for Barbie had started posting fan-made memes which showed Robbie alongside Oppenheimer's Cillian Murphy merged with the images of nuclear explosions.\n\nThe outrage was so intense that at one point a petition was made on Change.org urging Warner Bros and Universal Pictures, the studio behind Oppenheimer, to stop using the #Barbenheimer on social media. During that period, #NoBarbenheimer gained traction in the East Asian country leading Warner's Japan division to publicly criticize its U.S. counterpart, prompting the latter to issue an apology the following week. Despite the controversy, Japanese fans of the film expressed that the situation did not deter them from wanting to watch the movie in theaters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nALSO READ: Oppenheimer star Cillian Murphy open to playing Ken in Barbie sequel; praises Barbenheimer\n\nNo Oppenheimer release date in sight\n\nWhile fans were finally able to see Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling's Barbie on the big screens, the same cannot be said for Christopher Nolan's movie. No official release date for Oppenheimer has been made public in Japan. The Cillian Murphy starrer has faced criticism for its limited acknowledgment of the devastating impact of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, which resulted in the loss of over 200,000 lives.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbie has taken over the world, quite literally, you can't possibly scroll on social media for 2 minutes without coming across at least 1 post about the movie.\n\nALSO READ: Why did Warner Bros apologize to Japanese division over Barbenheimer meme?

        "text": "Photo-Illustration: Vulture; Photos: Warner Brothers, Universal Pictures\n\nAt the corner of 68th Street and Broadway, Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One is serving only one purpose: being my decoy ticket as I enter the world of Barbenheimer. After a successful opening weekend of his own, Tom Cruise just might be flopping in the face of these unlikely twin movies, officially born on July 21, that are ushering in a palpably exciting cinematic moment. Before arriving, I had a stray thought that maybe Barbenheimer exists only in the hearts of the terminally online, hyped up by media people such as myself but not really going to make as much noise IRL. Like, fine, the National Association of Theatre Owners is projecting that more than 200,000 moviegoers will do the double feature, per the Wrap, but that doesn’t mean much to someone who hasn’t taken a math class since 12th grade. Cruise may be under the impression that he’s cinema’s one true savior, brought to this earth to base-jump off cliffs and scale the Burj Khalifa to atone for our sins and sell seats to people who don’t really go to the movies anymore. But today, based on the neon-pink evidence at Manhattan’s AMC Lincoln Square, moviegoers don’t want to be saved. They want to be Barbenheimed.\n\nIt’s July 20, around 5:45 p.m., and everyone’s here for Greta Gerwig’s pink psychedelics or Christopher Nolan’s movie about a man in a porkpie hat. Kathleen Mukamal is doing the double feature alone. “I’m the same age as Barbie, you know,” she explains to me, wearing head-to-toe pink. “They say she was born months after me. I’m late in ’58. She’s ’59.” Mukamal’s fit matches the bandanna worn by her slayful Yorkshire terrier, Ruby, who’s attending the screening with her owner. It’s Oppenheimer first and then Barbie for her “because it was just what was available,” she says. “I got the front seat in each row. You know, the last seats that were available.”\n\nRuby and her owner, Kathleen Mukamal. Photo: Zoe Guy\n\nWhile loitering in the lobby, I’m confronted by an invasion of every shade of pink — fuchsia and coral and bubblegum and ballet slipper — all marching in lockstep up the escalators leading to the second and third floors. The sea of pink makes me happy I wore my magenta short-sleeved button-down, even if the sweat I emitted on the MTA’s saunalike platform is so bad that it’s gonna rudely manipulate me into finally taking the 100 percent silk shirt to the dry cleaner, a task I’ve managed to dodge since stealing it from my sister. If I hadn’t dressed for the occasion, I would simply look bitter and unpatriotic in the face of everyone else who adhered to the dress code. No one’s really dressing for Oppenheimer, as far as I can tell — except for the pair of men in blue shirts and briefcases who are running across the place at great speed, late for their screening, I suppose — but a third of the nearly two dozen people I speak with later are here for both. Maybe my pink is a force field against anyone who’s just seeing Oppenheimer, unclear, but not a soul I speak to tells me they’re here solely for a screening of that film. In the idle din at the moment, I overhear someone ask, “When’s the last time you had fun at the movies?” I can see this is the experience Cruise is probably horny for.\n\nI join the long line of people waiting to get inside the theater until I do a double take after seeing a young couple in matching Barbenheimer T-shirts. One shirt is pink and the other is black, but both share graphics with the movies in question and have Barbenheimer emblazoned in the Barbie font … or is it the Oppenheimer font? I get their attention. “We would love to talk, but we’re late for our Barbie showing,” the man says before I can get a good look. Being late is not an option, knowing that moviegoers paid upwards of $40 for the double feature tonight, not including their outfits, popcorn, and a drink.\n\nTaking in the scene, you don’t need to be a nuclear physicist to see that Barbie is winning this theater’s marketing battle and is even doing enough heavy lifting for Oppenheimer to benefit. There’s a massive Barbie ad on the escalator landing. A Barbie step-and-repeat with a matching pink carpet. A life-size Barbie-doll box. Each photo opportunity offers moviegoers the chance to take commemorative pictures with their dates holding pink Barbie Corvettes and dolls purchased at the concession stand (a $64.99 bundle) in one hand and free Barbie posters in the other. Though there’s nothing Oppenheimer-themed save for a poster in the dark first-floor lobby, a few people I chat with think Barbie’s 18-month marketing strategy has had a Reaganomics trickle-down effect on why they’re here for the bomb movie, too. “I am here to see Barbenheimer,” Matt tells me, wearing his ultrahigh platform heels and baby-pink Barbie tank while waiting to take pics in one of the photo ops. Why? “Well, Barbie ’cause Barbie’s everything, and Oppenheimer ’cause I need to know what the hype’s for.” Willyan Ferreira, for their part, adds that “pink is a very powerful color, and so is an atomic bomb.” A pink-and-blue virus has taken root here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/ 4\n\nChris, wearing a DayGlo Ken outfit, also thinks the Barbenheimer alliance is a joint slay. “I actually see it as a truce,” he says. His partner, Omar, sports yet another baby-pink tank, accessorized with a fuchsia bandanna around his neck. Chris continues, “I think anything that encourages people to go to the movies, like, great, do more double giant releases to get people back.” He’s optimistic about how this model could work in cinema’s favor: “I feel like this is the first time since the pandemic people are really flooding the movie theaters. I was laughing, saying I feel like the staff today is going to be like, ‘I don’t even remember how to do this!’”\n\nAfter a bit of a dustup with an usher who’s confused about why I bought a ticket for a movie I’m not seeing, I’m standing in the concessions area. Nearly every register is occupied to feed the masses, and the lines snake around the stanchions like a busy airport-security check. A screening of Barbie just let out, and I catch two college students from it sporting unofficial merch. Arnav Das is in a shirt featuring Ryan Gosling’s Ken, and Sofia Cedeño is wearing a shirt decorated with Margot Robbie’s Barbie; they tell me more merch should include T-shirts of the memes. “Have you seen the picture where it’s like Barbie and Oppenheimer shaking hands and then it’s blowing up in the background?” Cadeño asks me. I haven’t seen the meme. “They are, like, facing each other. Yeah, that’s the one I would want.”\n\nPhoto: Zoe Guy\n\nThey leave, and I wait in line with Luna Rahzel, a cosplayer who tells me she purchased two rows — that’s 22 tickets — for her and her cohort when tickets first went on sale. We make our way to the front of the line and Rahzel nabs the Corvette popcorn bucket and the Barbie-doll bundle on sale. Luckily, she’s here two hours early to grab some of the clearly dwindling supply. “Mattel is making hand over fist on this,” she jokes. “Woo, late-stage capitalism!”\n\nSome still seem to think Barbenheimer shouldn’t have declared a truce. Beth Slade, Hayden Murphy, and Caileigh Potter are “absolutely not” here for Nolan. “What are you going to wear to it? Black?” Potter wonders. “I don’t want to watch people get blown up. The world is dark enough as it is. I want to watch some joy, some pink, something silly, maybe cry a little bit, but in a fun, lighthearted way that’s nostalgic.” Skylar Theis, who will actually see both films, nails it: “She’s everything; he’s just Oppenheimer.”"

Or post-Oppie?' he asked his 465,000 Twitter followers.\n\n'We'll probably never know since no one seems to be keeping track of such things anymore. Keep up with your boosters and find a pink N-95 or KN-95 if you can.'\n\nDr. Peter Hotez said he knew he was being a 'Debbie Downer,' but warned people to take care if they were packing cinemas to see Barbie or Oppenheimer\n\nBarbie, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, is the biggest film opening so far this year\n\nOppenheimer, starring Cillian Murphy, has also drawn large crowds to movie theatres\n\nBoth films opened this weekend to widespread acclaim and large crowds.\n\nBarbie was the biggest opening of the year, with $162 million at the box office, while Oppenheimer took $82 million.\n\nThe surge in cinema attendance comes as COVID hospitalization rates trended slightly up last week but remained massively below their levels of even a year ago.\n\nIn the week of July 15, a total nationwide of 7,109 people were admitted to the hospital with COVID. By comparison, this week last year saw 45,000 people admitted.\n\nHotez made headlines in June when Democrat long-shot presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a noted anti-vaxxer, challenged the doctor to a debate on Joe Rogan's podcast.\n\nThat led Rogan, too, to challenge Hotez to a debate.\n\nHotez said he would happily appear on Rogan's show, but would not engage in a circus fight with Kennedy.\n\nThe suggestion of a Hotez-Kennedy debate sparked an online frenzy, and saw Hotez challenged at his home by Alex Rosen, a self-proclaimed 'independent journalist' who works for a site called 'Predator Poachers.'\n\nRosen, after exchanging pleasantries, asked Hotez why he wouldn't debate Kennedy.\n\n'Aw come on, that's harassing,' Hotez replied.\n\n'I'm just curious, nothing hostile, just curious,' responded Rosen.\n\nHotez says he's been stalked outside his home, as one right-wing commentator posted a video confronting him\n\nHotez said he hadn't made a decision, saying Rogan 'just invited me, so we'll see. We'll give it some thought.'\n\nAfter repeating he felt Hotez should debate, Rosen asked: 'What do you say to people who think they're vaccine injured?'\n\nHotez, clearly perturbed, began to close his gate and started to walk away from Rosen.\n\n'Ugh I just was stalked in front of my home by a couple of anti-vaxers taunting me to debate RFK Jr,' he tweeted.\n\n'Of course I was looking my Sunday best in our brutal heat wave. What is it with people?'\n\nKennedy in the interview on Rogan's podcast repeated his debunked claims that common childhood vaccines cause autism, which Hotez called 'just awful'.\n\nHotez added: 'It's clear many actually believe this nonsense.'\n\nRogan fired back with a challenge: 'Peter, if you claim what RFK Jr. is saying is 'misinformation' I am offering you $100,000.00 to the charity of your choice if you're willing to debate him on my show with no time limit.'\n\nRogan's interview with Kennedy drew backlash from Hotez who objected to vaccine concerns calling it 'just awful' as he lamented 'it's clear many actually believe this nonsense.'\n\nRFK Jr. appeared on Rogan's podcast, repeating his debunked claims that common childhood vaccines cause autism\n\nIn multiple tweets, Hotez indicated his willingness to appear on Rogan's podcast, which reaches a massive audience of millions on Spotify.\n\n'I'm happy to come on and have a meaningful discussion. I respect you and your show and I don't want an adversarial relationship. I think we can make some progress,' tweeted Hotez.\n\n'And I'm open to a number of different options, but to be pressured to give you an answer on Twitter, now, with a 'take it or leave it' demand that's not how I work. Honestly, I don't even think that would be in your best interests,' he wrote.\n\nKennedy also indicated his willingness to engage, tweeting: 'Peter. Let's finally have the respectful, congenial, informative debate that the American people deserve.'"

        "text": "The Barbenheimer phenomenon is almost certainly the most obnoxiously contrived and contrivedly obnoxious show business event since the day Danny Snyder pretended to put his wife in charge of the Washington Commanders. Everyone connected with this cynical combo plate, from filmmakers through actors, reviewers through moviegoers, deserve all the eye, skin, and social diseases one can get from trying to cut in on the latest trend in cultural death. Maybe that's just because your author seems to have other things to do when every movie in the world plays.\n\nBut because of an editor who will remain nameless even though it is that bastard Petchesky, Barbenheimer in the theater it had to be, upon which two things became clear.\n\nIf you watched Barbie before Oppenheimer as your victimized typist did, you got the order wrong. Barbie is simply a spoiler alert for our post-apocalyptic future, and in that context Oppenheimer merely becomes the turgid tale of a self-absorbed and smug power nerd who didn't make enough bombs to avert the future that included Barbie. Everybody with an opinion about this hype-powered combo-dirigible has already given it, and the verdict is in—they're both movies. Taken individually, they have that certain indefinable je ne sais blah, but rammed together they are famous for simply making no thematic sense as a pairing, forcing otherwise borderline decent people to compare blancmange and concrete because some death-warrants-with-marketing-degrees decreed it shall be an \"event.\" The wolverines who lunched up this twin monstrosity bought time, space, and bandwidth anywhere that accepted free content or ad money, found that news organizations are desperate to avoid all forms of work, and therefore hook/line/sinkered the whole mess, just to show their bosses they could.\n\nBarbie was, of course, all about the marketing, and in our theater (name withheld to keep the lawyers caged), the number of elderly folks dressed like Barbie and Ken reminded us yet again to see the good side of the planet being baked into oblivion by global warming. Even the restaurant adjacent to our local theater made its workers dress as Barbie characters (not hard, as most of the characters are either Barbie or Ken, and nobody is dressing up like Rhea Perlman) and offered up menu choices like Barbie Malibu (coconut rum infused with bubble gum extract, for the professional diabetic in your life) and Radioactive Deviled Eggs (probably an Oppenheimer reference but one can’t be certain).\n\nThe warmup act for Barbie was a couple of preteen girls either employed or dragooned to play a song (electric ukulele, to give you an idea) in a burst of reimagined vaudeville that can best be explained by the deathless phrase, \"This is a song we wrote last week, and I think it's the best song we've ever done.\" That seems a safe enough bet, and the polite army of Barbie impersonators in the audience applauded their courage.\n\nThe fact that nobody dressed up as Robert Oppenheimer at Movie Night, or really at any time since 1962, isn't the point. It's that cinematic polar opposites were shotgun-married to fake a weekend outing at the services of the Mattel Corporation and the wheezing movie industry.\n\nIt was a good weekend for box offices, (an estimated $155M for Barbs, $80M for Oppy), but how about the films? Your misshapen stenographer is not a movie critic and would rather become a narcotics informer than begin now, but you're paying for halfwit opinions, so here's another: Meh. Barbie plays out as if it were imagined by Joseph Stalin, Sofia Vergara, Brian Wilson, and a closet of crank-fueled HGTV showrunners, while Oppenheimer plays out as Stalin's breakout solo project. Either way, the villains (Lewis Strauss v. Ryan Gosling-Ken) are the same guy, and the heroes (Ruth Handler vs. Kitty Oppenheimer) aren't on long enough. And like most movies, the universal takeaway here is that the old adage, \"Always leave them wanting less,\" wins again. In this case the \"less\" in question is about 25 minutes of each, or the time of the average moviehouse nap, which your author successfully executed right about the time Matt Damon shows up as Sympathetic Careerist Colonel Pain In The Ass. No plot points were missed.\n\nBarbie decidedly began as more fun, Oppenheimer profoundly more dismal, and while after a clever run-up (hey, it's Helen Mirren!) Barbie got grimmer as the plot dumbed itself down for the required 10th-grade-level back-end movie lecture, Oppenheimer's lead in soul-crushing moroseness was too much to overcome. Then again, Oppenheimer was supposed to be Lars von Trier–level bleak, so in that way I guess it wins this match that should never have been made.\n\nThat's the real takeaway from the two films if, like us, you prefer people make their own judgments about their entertainment and then do the rest of the party the great courtesy of keeping their opinions to themselves. Both movies in their mashup form, after four Empress and tonics, two Angry Orchard ciders, and five or eight glasses of wine, seem to be treatises on America's polarities of institutionalized despair. No, your perturbed reviewer did not order all those himself. This is important for you to know because (a) no single person could drink that much and not breathalyze a night in the can, and (b) to let the kids in Defector Accounting know that they are on the hook for three dinners, six tickets, and all the alcohol. Yep, you sent us to the movies and we made it cost about three bills. Next time, you'll think a little harder about both the financial and psychic cost of such assignments. We could sit through Oppenheimer one more time at home if only to see what we missed during the nap, but Barbie is a one-off, as it was meant to be.\n\nIn other words, this entire mudslide of a weekend is now over and never to be referenced again. Even if the studios want to try this gambit again (imagine remakes of La La Land and The Killing Fields played for a film class at Northwestern with students powered by four hours' sleep and three gallons of Fireball), it will be hard to imagine us lurching at this particular hook ever again. After all, once is slightly forced weirdness, but twice is a week's worth of ESPN programming streamed on a perpetual loop, and absolutely nobody needs that. Plus, we intend to beat up the nameless editor who is still that worm Petchesky and abandon him in the New Hampshire woods. Now there's the happy ending we're all looking for."

        "text": "“Barbenheimer,” the simultaneous July 21 release of Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer,” turned a meme into the most widely anticipated cinematic event of the year. The films’ contrasting aesthetics have been fodder for jokes, photo edits and themed outfits. Fans have been delighting in their favorite filmmakers going head-to-head, pitting pitch black against bubblegum pink.\n\nThe whole thing is funny, if you are able to differentiate the film “Oppenheimer” from its real world inspiration, but that line has definitely blurred. When a “Barbie house” appeared in Malibu as a promotion for the film, the internet was quick to joke that the Oppenheimer team would nuke it for their own marketing campaign.\n\nBarbie and Oppenheimer are both trying to stop the destruction of their own worlds.\n\nThe films’ apparent incongruity created a farcical pairing that busted the box office. Tens of thousands of people bought same-day tickets for both “Oppenheimer” and “Barbie,” watching them as a double feature. In their first weekend, “Oppenheimer” grossed $82.4 million and “Barbie” a whopping $155 million at the domestic box office—becoming the biggest-ever opening box office for a film directed by a woman. What fans who saw both didn’t expect was how well the apparent opposites thematically complement each other.\n\nFor all their differences, Barbenheimer has some genuine thematic throughlines. Lynda Carter, the actress most famous for her portrayal of a super-Barbie role in the 1970s Wonder Woman show, brilliantly observed that “Barbie lives in the world Oppenheimer made.” That is undeniably true. Barbie was first created in the late 1950s, the most nuclear-haunted time of world history, which was also the pinnacle of the post-war consumer boom. “Barbie” may have been a reaction to the post-war restoration of traditional gender roles, when the G.I. Kens came back from the war and Rosie the Riveters were kicked out of the shipyards and sent back to the kitchens.\n\nPerhaps the most striking example was the ending of the free child care programs the federal government had created to accommodate so many mothers going to build planes, tanks and ships. It was an intentional move to get women back into the home. This is almost exactly what occurs in “Barbie,” when Ken returns from the “real world” enamored of patriarchy and ready to introduce traditional gender roles in the Barbieland utopia.\n\nThe actress Lynda Carter brilliantly observed that “Barbie lives in the world Oppenheimer made.”\n\nBoth films dig into titular characters uncomfortable with their own legacies. This may seem an odd comparison. After all, J. Robert Oppenheimer created the atomic bomb, and Barbie is a plastic doll. But both created (and are creations of) their particular moments of American history—moments whose legacies we are still dealing with today.\n\nBarbie takes her legacy very seriously. In the film, all the Barbies in Barbieland think they have solved all the world’s problems for women, but as soon as she enters the real world, a girl accuses Barbie of fascism, stating she makes women feel bad about themselves and displays unrealistic beauty standards. Barbie weeps at this criticism. In a speech intended to celebrate the bomb’s use, Oppenheimer envisions the bomb’s destruction in an incinerated skeleton and a woman with flaking skin. Neither Oppenheimer nor Barbie really understands that they’ve done anything wrong until they confront the effects of their actions. They are both haunted by unintended consequences and wrestle with the fact that many people do not like or approve of them.\n\nTaken together, Barbenheimer is a scathing indictment of life in a man’s world.\n\nNeither character directly apologizes or asks for forgiveness, and neither can truly dismantle the damage they have done. Yet they both try to distance themselves from their pasts. Oppenheimer, in real life and in the film, continues to work in nuclear science but becomes opposed to further nuclear proliferation and the brewing arms race with the Soviets. Meanwhile, Barbie works to let go of the perfectionism that plagues her and her legacy. They are both seeking penance, but neither truly believes they are deserving of forgiveness. Barbie’s fears are met with kindness: Gloria, the woman who brought Barbie to the real world, reassures her: “You are so beautiful and so smart, and it kills me that you don’t think you’re good enough.” Oppenheimer’s wife confirms his fears: “You think because you let them tar and feather you that the world will forgive you? They won’t.”\n\nTaken together, Barbenheimer is a scathing indictment of life in a man’s world. Barbie is overt in its criticism of the patriarchy, even if delivering it within a satire. The male-dominated “Oppenheimer” is a little more subtextual. No women are in the rooms where it is decided to drop the bombs that kill between 129,000 and 226,000 people. U.S. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson jokes he doesn’t want to drop the bomb on Kyoto because he honeymooned there. Nolan uses this moment to underline how out of touch these powerful men are with the reality of what they are doing. Oppenheimer says he lost his faith in the project when he realized that anything he built would be used against our enemies in war. Barbie and Oppenheimer did not choose how the world reacted to them, but there were real-world consequences whether intended or not.\n\nBarbie and Oppenheimer also both deal with existential dread. They question the meaning of death and wrestle with the sanctity of life. Oppenheimer is utilitarian in his thinking about the bomb until it is used. He justifies its creation by saying, “I don’t know if we can be trusted with such a weapon. But I know the Nazis can’t.” But by the time the bomb is built, the Nazis had already been defeated. And though the bombs may have hastened the end of the war, he cannot help feeling he has blood on his hands. Barbie feels the sanctity of her own life as she steps into what it means to be human, mortal and imperfect. These two people didn’t mean to be more than they are. He just wanted to be a physicist, and she just wants to be a woman.\n\nBarbie and Oppenheimer are both trying to stop the destruction of their own worlds. Oppenheimer seems resigned to the fact that the damage is done and nuclear war is inevitable. Barbie is hopeful that things can and will change for the better. They make a much more thought-provoking pairing than a mere internet meme could convey. The juxtaposition of masculine and feminine, destruction and creation, dread and hope, may leave moviegoers thinking a little harder about their own place in the world."

        "text": "As our team scoped the timepieces of everyone involved in the films and promotional tours, Tag Heuer and Hamilton were the clear winners: they were almost the only watch brands present in Barbie and Oppenheimer, respectively.\n\nThe much-anticipated simultaneous release of blockbuster films Barbie and Oppenheimer on July 21 finally brought the “Barbenheimer” movement to a crescendo. The tongue-in-cheek portmanteau refers to the entertaining duality between the bubblegum celebration of Mattel’s iconic doll and the grim ethical and historical overtones from the story of the father of the atomic bomb.\n\nWhile perhaps not quite a thematic Barbenheimer equivalent in the watch world, it’s still interesting to see references from both watch houses appearing on the silver screen and red carpet, thanks to the brands’ partnerships with the films’ cast members.\n\nSpoilers ahead as we check out the timepieces from Barbie and Oppenheimer!\n\nTag Heuer x Barbie\n\nRyan Gosling leads a show-stopping musical number in Barbie. Photo: Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nIt should be far from surprising that Ryan Gosling’s ambassadorship with Tag Heuer made its way into the movie as Beach Ken wrestled with the gender role reversal he experienced in reality vs Barbieland.\n\nKen bringing patriarchy – and plenty of horses – to Barbieland was a sour note in the second act of the film, but it did give us Gosling in a fur coat along with several pairs of shades and no less than three different vintage Heuer Carrera chronographs on his wrists at the same time, as reported by Hodinkee.\n\nTwo of the three Heuer Carreras that Ryan Gosling’s Ken wore in Barbie. Photos: Handout\n\nThe pieces themselves are from the 1960s and 70s, from before Heuer was bought by the Tag racing company and a few years after the original Ken was introduced in 1961. However, we surmise that the watches were chosen not so much for their horological significance (all three are seminal pieces in Heuer’s history of chronographs) but for the sheer golden decadence the pieces exude.\n\nRyan Gosling at Canadian promotions for Barbie, sporting a pink Tag Heuer Carrera Date 36mm. Photo: Getty Images\n\nTo cap it all off, Gosling sported a more modern, pink Tag Heuer Carrera Date 36mm in Toronto for the Canadian leg of promotions, in contrast with his pastel blue and pink suit, per media reports.\n\nHamilton x Oppenheimer\n\nOppenheimer was written and directed by Christopher Nolan. Photo: Universal Pictures\n\nThe temptation to label Tag Heuer x Hamilton the Barbenheimer of watches this summer is strong, but even though both films tapped long-standing partnerships to source three vintage references from the respective brands for the screen, the similarities end there.\n\nHamilton vintage pieces worn by Cillian Murphy in Oppenheimer, from left to right: Cushion B, Lexington and Endicott. Photo: Hamilton\n\nSeasoned director Christopher Nolan tapped his long-standing relationship with Hamilton to source vintage pieces for the biopic on J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb played by Cillian Murphy.\n\nThe film comprises interwoven scenes from Oppenheimer’s early life and career, his work with the Manhattan Project in the 1940s developing the atomic bomb, and subsequent security hearings in the 1950s with Congress and the United States Atomic Energy Commission regarding suspected Communist leanings and his clearance to work on atomic weapons.\n\nMatt Damon wore Hamilton pieces as lieutenant general Leslie Jones in Oppenheimer: left, the Military Ordonance and right, the Piping Rock. Photo: Hamilton\n\nMurphy sported the period-appropriate Cushion B two-handed 1930s piece alongside the black-dialled Lexington and golden Endicott, both with sub-seconds dials and from the 1940s, the brand confirmed.\n\nEmily Blunt , who plays Kitty Oppenheimer, sports the discreet Lady Hamilton A-2 in a square case with gold-coloured indices and hands; while Matt Damon, as lieutenant general Leslie Groves, wears the Piping Rock and Military Ordonance – both quintessential pieces for military men during the period.\n\nHamilton Khaki Field “Murph” 38mm, inspired by the unique version of the Khaki Field Auto from Christopher Nolan’s 2014 film Interstellar. Photo: Hamilton\n\nNolan’s relationship with Hamilton is well-known – as is his tendency to play with the concept of time in his films. Hamilton provided a version of the Khaki Navy BelowZero for his 2020 feature Tenet.\n\nBut his most famous collaboration with the brand was its unique design for the Hamilton Khaki Field. The subsequent significance of the watch to the plot of his 2014 hit Interstellar resulted in the release of the Hamilton Khaki Field Murph 42mm in 2019, per the brand. The latter most recently received a refresh in 38mm in 2022."

        "text": "This summer’s biggest movie releases brought us “Oppenheimer,” a real-life thriller about a weapon that could save and possibly destroy humanity, and “Barbie,” a musical comedy about a doll that thinks she’s solved but actually set back equal rights.\n\nWhile some people have turned the movies into a double-feature, my version of Barbenheimer pairs “Barbie” with “Mild Vertigo,” a newly translated Japanese novel. I haven’t come up with a cute mashup name for these two works that dig into the paradoxes of being a woman. (No spoilers ahead for either film or the book.)\n\n“Mild Vertigo” is narrated by Natsumi, a stay-at-home mom tending to her apartment in Tokyo. We hear voices of neighbors gossiping over the minute differences in the neighborhoods’ apartments A-F. We hear the chatter of birds outside the windows and from Natsumi’s past. And we hear her thoughts, a running commentary of the minutiae in her boring life. What to buy. How to clean. Her days are nothing and everything.\n\nHer stream of consciousness with sentences stretching several pages reminds me of modernist writers like Gertrude Stein from a century ago. Mieko Kanai wrote “Mild Vertigo” in 1997. The English translation was released this spring, leaving me wondering what’s really changed — not stylistically, but the subtext.\n\nAs I write this, I heard the chime of Beepy, the robot vacuum, and paused to empty it and saw the swim bag next to the trashcan and made sure it has my daughter’s swimsuit, the one with long sleeves to protect her from the sun, and water shoes and sunscreen for today’s swim class. (Will it be canceled because there’s a 60% chance of rain? How will the teacher reach out about a cancellation? We’ve emailed but does she check her email often? Can she check it when she spends her day in the pool?) Should I roast some vegetables now when nobody’s in the hot kitchen and was this vacuum a stupid splurge even if it was a Prime Day deal and that review site said it was good and it has cleaned more than any adult has in a while and why do people care about how clean a floor is? Do I care about the people who do care?\n\nNatsumi’s banal narrative exposes what’s beneath the performance of life, maintaining appearances.\n\nIn “Barbie,” the Barbies rule and run Barbieland. They can do anything so they do everything. Their days may not be filled with keeping house and caregiving but they’re still Sisyphean.\n\n“This is the best day ever. So was yesterday and so is tomorrow and every day from now until forever,” says stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) during a fabulously sparkly choreographed dance.\n\nHer day is just like how kids play. No water in the shower or milk in the carton. No need to walk down the stairs when you can float down to the ground for a fun day at the beach. Her days are nothing and everything. When things start to change, Barbie wants nothing more than a normal day that ends, as every day ends, with a girls night.\n\nKenergy aside, a pivotal moment in “Barbie” is the monologue of Gloria (America Ferrera) about the ridiculousness of the double standards woman juggle. The original monologue was written by director Greta Gerwig with notes from Ferrera and took almost 30 takes to capture.\n\nIt’s a message that has brought viewers to tears and in the film, inspired stereotypical Barbie out of her hopelessness into action.\n\n“By giving voice to the cognitive dissonance required to be a woman under the patriarchy, you robbed it of its power,” Barbie says.\n\nThese two works give a voice to what’s unsaid: the unrealistic expectations, the mental labor of caregiving, the adjustments under the gaze. Perhaps they’re real-life thrillers about something that could save humanity."

        "text": "There are two new wide or semi-wide releases this weekend, “The Last Voyage of the Demeter” and “Jules,” but how many moviegoers will actually buy tickets with so many other stronger contenders still in theaters? Read on for Gold Derby’s box office preview.\n\nBefore we get to the new movies this week, we probably should address the “Barbenheimer” in the room. There’s very little doubt that “Barbie” can pull off a rare fourth weekend at #1 with upwards of $32 million or more after holding up so well against “Meg 2” and the “Ninja Turtles” this past weekend. Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” also has a good chance at reclaiming second place, since it’s likely to have a smaller drop-off this weekend than both of last week’s new movies.\n\nSEE Box office: ‘Barbie’ crosses $400 million mark in less than 3 weeks\n\n“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” was just two million behind “Meg 2: The Trench” over the weekend but received much better reviews and a higher CinemaScore, so we can probably expect it to hold up better and take third place, leaving fourth place for “Meg 2.”\n\nThat brings us to the first of the new wide releases, and that is Universal Pictures’ “The Last Voyage of the Demeter,” directed by André Øvredal (“Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark”). It’s based on the section of Bram Stoker’s “Dracula” where the vampire travels by ship from Romania to England to continue his reign of terror. In this case, Dracula (or “Nosferatu,” going by the 1922 silent classic starring Max Schreck) is played by creature performer and actor Javier Botet.\n\nThe crew of the Demeter – that’s the name of the ship – includes Corey Hawkins from “Straight Outta Compton” as a British doctor hoping to get a trip back home, while the captain is played by veteran actor Liam Cunningham (“Game of Thrones”) and his young son is played by Woody Norman (“C’mon C’mon”). Other known names and/or faces include David Dastmalchian (“Ant-Man,” “The Boogeyman”) as the ship’s first mate and Irish-Italian actress Aisling Franciosi (also “GoT”) as a stowaway.\n\nWhile the movie definitely has the Dracula thing going for it and being dark horror by a fairly well-respected genre filmmaker like Øvredal, it’s also a period gothic horror film, which tend to be a tougher sell to American audiences. Case in point: 2012’s “The Woman in Black,” starring Daniel Radcliffe, opened shortly after the end of his “Harry Potter” run with $20.9 million in early February; its 2015 sequel sans Radcliffe earned roughly half the original film’s domestic take. The 2018 gothic horror film “Winchester” (also from the now defunct CBS Films) opened on the same weekend as “Woman in Black” with just $9.3 million and grossed less than $46 million worldwide.\n\nSEE Grab the popcorn and sound off in our movie forums\n\nEarlier this year, the Dracula horror-comedy spin-off “Renfield,” starring Nicholas Hoult and Nicolas Cage as Dracula, bombed quite badly, opening with just $8 million, so it’s odd for Universal to be releasing another Dracula spin-off (essentially) so soon.\n\nThere’s a good chance that a movie like “Demeter” can do well in European and other international countries, but Universal is only opening the movie in roughly 2,600 North American theaters, maybe realizing it would be a tougher sell. Reviews (which won’t hit until Thursday) probably won’t be so kind for various reasons I won’t break embargo to share, but those things alone might keep “The Last Voyage of the Demeter” from opening over $10 million. Because of that, it’s likely to open in fifth place behind last week’s rejiggered top four.\n\nFilmmaker Marc Turtletaub, who received an Oscar nomination for producing “Little Miss Sunshine,” directs “Jules,” a smaller indie comedy starring Sir Ben Kingsley as a small-town Pennsylvania resident who encounters an alien after his craft crash lands in his garden. Bleecker Street Films will be releasing the movie moderately wide on Friday, also in an attempt to try to grab older adult business away from “Oppenheimer” mostly.\n\nSEE 2023 box office hits: Every movie that made more than $100 million\n\nTurtletaub previously directed the Sundance drama “Puzzle,” starring Kelly McDonald and late Bollywood great Irrfan Khan, but that movie didn’t even make $2.3 million worldwide, which is not a good sign that the producer of so many huge hits picks the best material to direct. (Turtletaub previously wrote “Gods Behaving Badly” and two short films, but he didn’t write either of his most recent features.)\n\nAlthough Kingsley probably has a decent draw with older audiences, as does his co-star, Jane Curtin, a veteran from the early days of “Saturday Night Live,” there’s no theater count reported for “Jules,” as of this writing. Without having a presence in more than 1,000 theaters, there’s no guarantee this can even get into the Top 10, making something closer to the $2 million opening for the Bleecker Street release “Mafia Mamma” earlier this year, but probably less.\n\nAlso, Cohen Media Group will give a platform release to Juliet Binoche’s latest film “Between Two Worlds,” directed by Emmanuel Carrère. Check back on Sunday to see if the new movies fare better against the late summer blockbusters.\n\nSIGN UP for Gold Derby’s free newsletter with latest predictions"

        "text": "The AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. shareholder seeking to derail the settlement over its APE units renewed her bid to halt any stock conversion for an appeal if the deal is approved.\n\nThe success of blockbusters “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” and the theater chain’s own actions belie the idea that it will be ruined by any delay in converting the preferred units to common stock, according to court papers filed Tuesday and late Monday by Rose Izzo, the retail investor leading the charge against the settlement.\n\nAMC’s “overhyped concerns and unreasonable demands ring hollow,” according to the filing in Delaware’s Chancery Court. “If defendants believe their own math, then waiting three weeks to correct a problem raised at the settlement hearing cost AMC approximately $25 million. They should welcome some preemptive action.”\n\nIn pushing to delay any conversion of the AMC Preferred Equity units, or APEs, Izzo is seeking to capitalize on Vice Chancellor Morgan T. Zurn’s ruling rejecting the original version of the settlement, which stunned analysts July 21, scrambling the trading positions of arbitragers betting on the conversion. The decision sent AMC common stock surging and the preferred units plunging.\n\nHollywood Strikes, ‘Barbenheimer’\n\nIzzo is one of the nearly 3,000 retail investors—many of them participants in the “meme stock” rally that saved the company from a pandemic-era bankruptcy—who wrote to the court to oppose the settlement. The deal, announced in April, has fluctuated in value within the $110 million to $120 million range, depending on AMC’s stock price.\n\nShe’s the only one who showed up at a June court hearing with an attorney to formally object. Her lawyer, Ted Kittila, has said he’s ready to take over the case, scuttle the agreement, and resume the court fight on behalf of investors who feel “stabbed in the back” by the company and the shareholders that negotiated the deal.\n\nZurn’s surprise ruling rejecting the settlement was a relatively narrow one. She turned the deal down over provisions—which she had flagged at the hearing three weeks earlier—that waived any claims by common stockholders, including those involving APEs they might also hold. State corporate laws require such releases to work on a share-by-share rather than investor-by-investor basis, the judge said.\n\nAMC and the lead shareholders swiftly filed a revised settlement aimed at addressing those concerns, and Zurn agreed within days to resume weighing the agreement without offering investors a new opportunity to object. Both sides stressed in court papers the importance of a ruling in the first half of August, “before the capital markets go quiet” until after Labor Day.\n\nThe company’s filing described Hollywood’s ongoing labor strikes as a “serious threat,” echoing a July 23 open letter from CEO Adam Aron stating that AMC’s “risk of financial collapse is not whimsical.” The theater chain has since been buoyed by the simultaneous blockbusters.\n\nPlaying Coy\n\nIzzo, meanwhile, has sought to ensure that her channels of appeal remain open if Zurn signs off on the revised settlement. Letting the APE conversion go through while the state’s top court is considering the case would “frustrate appellate review,” according to her court filing Tuesday.\n\n“Clawing back the settlement consideration following a successful appeal may be impossible,” Izzo said. She also pointed to the “Barbenheimer” revenues AMC is now enjoying. “The parties play coy as to why disaster is closer now,” following “unrelenting positive news,” the filing said.\n\nAlso Tuesday, another shareholder leading a separate lawsuit against AMC—one that would force the company to hold its first annual meeting and board election since June 2022—accused the company of stalling on an expedited hearing date. “This matter can and should be set for a hearing in August,” he said.\n\nIzzo is represented by is represented by Halloran Farkas & Kittila LLP. AMC is represented by Richards, Layton & Finger PA and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP. Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann LLP, Grant & Eisenhofer PA, Fields Kupka & Shukurov LLP, and Saxena White PA are counsel for the pension fund and investor leading the litigation.\n\nThe cases are In re AMC Ent. Holdings Inc. S’holder Litig., Del. Ch., No. 2023-0215, 8/1/23 and Barnes v. AMC Ent. Holdings Inc., Del. Ch., No. 2023-0718, 8/1/23."

        "text": "After three weekends in theaters, Greta Gerwig’s \"Barbie\" surpassed the $1 billion mark in global ticket sales. Gerwig became the highest grossing female director of all time, breaking a record previously held by Patty Jenkins, director of \"Wonder Woman.\"\n\nThe highly anticipated paranoia thriller, \"Oppenheimer\" was directed by Christopher Nolan and released the same weekend as \"Barbie.\" The two films collectively generated $244.5 million in North American ticket sales their opening weekend in theaters. “Barbie” brought in $162 million, followed by “Oppenheimer” at $82.5 million.\n\nThe Margot Robbie-led and produced film has been comfortably seated in first place since the film's release on July 21.\n\nMovie ticket sales are crawling back to pre-pandemic levels\n\nAccording to The Numbers, a publicly available database of movie industry statistics, annual tickets sold for 2023 are expected to reach 922 million. That's compared to 2022, where total tickets sold reached 709 million. While 2023 ticket sales are not expected to surpass 2019’s pre-pandemic levels of 1.2 billion, they’re inching closer, partially in service to the global sensation that is \"Barbenheimer.\"\n\nShawn Robbins, chief analyst at Box Office Pro, said \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" drove a huge social conversation that went above and beyond the internet. The meme of \"Barbenheimer\" caught wildfire, Robbins said. “Everybody heard about it, and everybody outside of movie circles has been talking about it for the last few weeks.” The cultural phenomenon drove non-moviegoers to the theaters, breaking significant box-office records.\n\nTheater-etiquette:Bad behavior in blockbusters sparks discussion\n\nThe 'Barbenheimer’ phenomenon:How a movie meme inspired the 'crazy, weird' double feature\n\n'Barbie' smashes box office records\n\nWhile “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” is currently the highest-grossing movie of 2023 sitting at $1.35 billion, “Barbie” is projected to beat that record. “Barbie” not only had the biggest opening weekend of 2023, but it was also the biggest opening weekend for any movie directed by a woman.\n\nDomestic box-office sales for \"Barbie\" and “Oppenheimer,\" combined were the fourth largest of all time for an opening weekend. The only bigger opening movie weekends were for “Avengers,\" \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" or “Star Wars” films.\n\n\"Barbie\" had the biggest opening week in history of any Warner Bros. film, raking in more than half a billion dollars.\n\n“Barbie stands out as one of the very few female-centric, female-targeted blockbusters of the summer,” said Robbins. \"The movie offered something fresh in a summer that’s been jam-packed with franchise sequels.\"\n\nYoung people are driving a movie-theater comeback\n\nWhile movie ticket sales and box office numbers are not back to pre-pandemic levels, industry data shows that young people are behind the growing market of moviegoers. About 80% of the \"Barbie\" audience was younger than 35. And 65% of the audience was female, according to data from Box Office Pro.\n\n“The audience driving this rebound has been young.” Robbins said. He pointed to “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” as an example of a film playing well to a younger audience.\n\nThe year-to-date domestic box office recently crossed the $6 billion mark. The last time this mark was hit in summer was in early July 2019, according to data shared by Robbins.\n\nBut keep in mind, with screenwriters and actors on strike, the movie industry is destined to feel the impact of delayed and or canceled production."

        "text": "Update, July 24: The final numbers are in, and they’re huge: Barbie wound up earning $162 million domestic, with Oppenheimer coming in at $82.5 million. Internationally, Barbie made $194.3 million, with Oppenheimer earning $98 million. Math is hard, but let’s just say that’s a lot of money.\n\nThe original story continues below.\n\nFor weeks now, movie pundits have wondered just how much money Barbie and Oppenheimer would make on their combined opening weekend. As of Sunday, we have the answer: enough to buy a lot of Dreamhouses (and/or kitchen-free homes in Los Alomos).\n\nThe actual numbers are nothing short of staggering. Though final tallies won’t be available til Monday, it seems that Greta Gerwig’s Barbie has raked in about $155 million domestically and another $182 million internationally, exceeding even sky-high expectations. Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer has earned about $80.5 million domestic and $93.7 million internationally—a pretty stunning take for a three-hour drama about men in hats discussing theoretical physics.\n\nThat means together, the phenomenon known as Barbenheimer has made about $511 million worldwide, $235.5 million of which was earned domestically—enough to make this the fourth-highest grossing weekend in American history, and the only one of those four weekends not driven by a Disney-released sequel. (The openings of Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame, and Star Wars: The Force Awakens occupy the no. 1, 2, and 3 slots, respectively.)\n\nDeadline has a rundown of all the box office records that have just been broken: Barbie now boasts the biggest opening weekend ever for a female director. It's also the largest opening weekend for a movie based on a toy (beating out Transformers: Dark of the Moon). Oppenheimer has the biggest global opening for a biopic.\n\nBut those stats undersell what really was, and is, special about Barbenheimer. Heavily marketed as both these films have been, their massive success feels like an organic phenomenon, driven by actual enthusiasm from actual people. (What a concept!) Yes, Barbie is based on IP, and so, in a sense, is Oppenheimer. Both films are nevertheless idiosyncratic, auteur-driven projects, and not the sort of high-octane action franchise continuations studios seem to believe are the only sort of movie capable of making big money anymore. Both are also being received better than most wannabe blockbusters: critics (including Vanity Fair’s!) have reacted warmly to each film, while audiences have given each film an A Cinemascore.\n\nWhat’s more, the apparent contrast between Barbie and Oppenheimer wound up working in both films' favor; scores of moviegoers elected to see not one movie but both, dressing up in midcentury hats and suits as well as their Barbie best. “People recognized that something special was happening and they wanted to be a part of it,” Michael O’Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners, told CNBC. “Our partners in the creative community and at the studios gave audiences two uniquely different, smart and original stories that were meant for the big screen, and movie lovers responded by gathering friends and family and heading to their local movie houses across the nation.”\n\nThe singularity of Barbenheimer will be difficult if not impossible to recreate, though that doesn’t mean studios won’t try. We can only hope, then, that they take the right lesson from this weekend: as Nicole Kidman keeps telling us, people want to go back to movie theaters. They’re simply more willing to return if it means getting to see something they haven’t seen a million times before."

        "text": "\"I don't think anyone could have reasonably predicted this kind of confluence between 'Oppenheimer' and 'Barbie,'\" said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. \"If you're going to a theater right now, the communal experience is reminiscent of major Marvel and Star Wars films, but without those franchises remotely involved.\"\n\n\"Barbie\" tallied around $155 million during its first three days in theaters, the highest opening of 2023. Its counterpart \"Oppenheimer\" made $82.4 million over the weekend, according to numbers released Monday.\n\n\"Barbenheimer\" exploded over the weekend, generating more than $235.5 million in ticket sales and reinvigorating the domestic box office.\n\nMore than 18.5 million tickets were bought for the combination of Warner Bros. ' \"Barbie\" and Universal's \"Oppenheimer,\" 12.8 million for \"Barbie\" and 5.8 million for \"Oppenheimer,\" according to data from EntTelligence.\n\n\"It was a truly historic weekend and continues the positive box office momentum of 2023,\" said Michael O'Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners. \"More importantly, it proves once again that America loves going to the movies to see great films.\"\n\nBoth films hold a rating of more than 90% \"Fresh\" on Rotten Tomatoes and inspired moviegoers to dress head-to-toe in pink or don suits and hats during their screenings.\n\n\"People recognized that something special was happening and they wanted to be a part of it,\" O'Leary said. \"Our partners in the creative community and at the studios gave audiences two uniquely different, smart and original stories that were meant for the big screen and movie lovers responded by gathering friends and family and heading to their local movie houses across the nation.\"\n\nWith additional ticket sales from Paramount's newest \"Mission Impossible\" film, Sony's \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" and Angel Studios' \"The Sound of Freedom,\" the weekend box office is expected to reach $302 million, the highest of any weekend in 2023, according to data from Comscore.\n\n\"The unprecedented performance of these two films, and the boost it gave to the overall movie marketplace, solidified the movie theater as a cultural hub and epicenter of social interaction,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.\n\n\"Barbenheimer\" weekend is currently set to be the fourth-highest weekend haul of all-time, just below the three-day stretch when Disney's \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" arrived in theaters in December 2015 and helped boost the overall weekend haul to $313 million. The second-highest is $314 million from April 2018's opening weekend of \"Avengers: Infinity War.\"\n\nSome box office analysts project that Monday's official weekend numbers could be quite a bit higher than Sunday's estimates, and push \"Barbenheimer\" weekend up the charts. However, they won't come close to the highest-grossing weekend ever, which occurred in April 2019 when \"Avengers: Endgame\" hit theaters, drumming up $357 million on its own, and leading to a $402 million overall weekend tally.\n\nThe success of \"Barbenheimer\" comes at a time when the domestic box office has faced some hurdles. A slew of adult-aimed blockbusters have underperformed, leading many in the industry to question if consumer tastes have shifted away from Hollywood.\n\nWarner Bros.' \"The Flash\" has fizzled, Pixar's \"Elemental\" failed to lure in family audiences and even the return of Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones wasn't enough to pack cinemas.\n\nHowever, the combination of bombs and blonde bombshells seems to have inspired plenty of moviegoers to leave their couches for the cinema.\n\n\"It's a historic result that showcases the enthusiasm audiences have for a variety of fresh content,\" Robbins said. \"These films have exquisitely tapped into the cultural zeitgeist. They've reignited the summer box office flame, and they've proven that studios can be a little more aggressive with counter-programming strategies in the future.\"\n\nDisclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC. NBCUniversal is the distributor of \"Oppenheimer\" and owns Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nFor more, check out CNBC Select's story on how to save money on movie tickets."

        "text": "The dual release of Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” on July 21 has restored the box office to its pre-COVID glory, and the effects have been felt around the world.\n\nAs of Aug. 14, “Barbie” — a comedy starring Margot Robbie as the iconic doll who goes through an existential crisis — has crossed the $1 billion mark worldwide (earning $1.18 billion so far), making Gerwig the first solo female director to do so. But “Oppenheimer,” in which Cillian Murphy portrays the father of the atomic bomb, has also stood its ground, making $648 million globally — an amazing feat for a three-hour-long film based on a historical figure.\n\nThough “Barbie” has held tightly onto the No. 1 spot at the domestic box office since its release, “Oppenheimer” has fought its way to the top in other major markets, including India and Hong Kong. And, both films have stirred up some controversy in various countries due to their themes — specifically, “Barbie’s” feminist undertones and “Oppenheimer’s” depiction of the creation of the bombs that were dropped in Japan — oftentimes making one the winner by default.\n\nAfter the fourth weekends of release for both “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” below is a breakdown of how the movies have performed so far in the world’s biggest markets, using industry estimates and data from Box Office Mojo."

        "text": "When Christopher Nolan was doing research for \"Oppenheimer,\" he quietly joined a walking tour of the grounds in Los Alamos, N.M., the epicenter of the Manhattan Project.\n\nThe director was so impressed that he decided to turn this tucked-away town of 13,000 into a Hollywood lot. For two weeks in spring 2022, celebrities including Matt Damon and Emily Blunt shot in local locations, including the former cottage of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the key figure in America's quest to build an atomic bomb and win a war.\n\nThat house probably won't be open to the public until later this year. But Los Alamos is already worth exploring.\n\nIn June, I started with the free Bradbury Science Museum, named after Norris E. Bradbury, who replaced Oppenheimer as head of the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Fortunately, the gregarious security guard didn't evict me for assuming the center would be a tribute to science fiction writer Ray Bradbury.\n\nThe exhibits detailing the lab's work on stuff like algae biofuels and nanotechnology went over my head. But the film \"Racing Toward Dawn,\" which chronicled how Oppenheimer and his colleagues picked this city for its secret experiments, was geared toward dimwits like me.\n\nIt was the perfect prep for the $25 deluxe walking tour that embarked from the Los Alamos History Museum gift shop, just three blocks away.\n\nBefore my group of seven took off, I had time to check out a few displays. My favorite nugget: a copy of the daily \"secret\" newsletter from Dec. 22, 1943, which warned readers to recycle their Coca-Cola bottles and to avoid burning their Christmas trees. It also let folks know that the featured movie that evening would be \"Old Acquaintance\" starring Bette Davis.\n\nThe Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, N.M.\n\nHistory tour\n\nOur tour guide, Kathy, preferred to serve up history in chronological order, which meant our 90-minute walk started with a stop at an 800-year-old ancestral Pueblo site. She soon jumped centuries ahead to the period in which Los Alamos played host to the all-boys Ranch School, whose students included future Sears, Roebuck president Arthur Wood and writer Gore Vidal.\n\nKathy nearly spat on the ground when she pointed to the former site of the school's dorms, now one of the most unattractive strip malls this side of the Mississippi. A military team led by Brig. Gen. Leslie Groves shut down the school in 1942, so it could be adapted for the needs of its incoming residents.\n\nMany of the buildings were torn down, but Fuller Lodge, the school's dining hall, remained. The scientists would also use it for meals, as well as for late-night activities that no teenage boy should ever attend.\n\nArchitect John Gaw Meem used wood from more than 700 Ponderosa pines to construct this marvel that's part barn, part palace. If the super-wealthy ever got into square dancing, this would be party central.\n\nJust outside the lodge stands bronze statues of Oppenheimer and Groves. Kathy pointed out that the replica of the military commander isn't entirely accurate. His family asked that designers not show off his impressive pot belly.\n\nNext up was a walk down Bathtub Row, so named because its residents had the only tubs in town. During the stroll, Kathy entertained our group with tales of Russian spies and how Oppenheimer's security clearance was eventually revoked.\n\nShe also shared how excited she was about the \"Oppenheimer\" movie. She guaranteed that it would be better than 2014's \"Manhattan,\" the locally shot TV series so inaccurate that her husband, who worked for the laboratory at the time, screamed at the TV for 10 minutes.\n\nAll we could do once we arrived at the Oppenheimer house was peek through the windows. I was surprised to see pristine furniture in the living room that looked like it was part of a movie set. That's because it was.\n\nThe History Museum is planning to keep the house furnished with movie props rather than stock it with Oppenheimer's original couches and tables, a decision that should delight film fans and irk history buffs once it's open to the public.\n\nYou can go inside the neighboring house of Hans Bethe, who headed up the Manhattan Project's Theoretical Division. It hosts a history lesson on the Cold War, just one of the many attractions that force you to contemplate whether what these geniuses made here was a blessing or a curse.\n\nThe Los Alamos National Laboratory’s Chemistry and Metallurgy Research facility and the lab’s largest building.\n\nIn and around Los Alamos\n\nThere are many ways to get to Los Alamos. I caught a flight to Albuquerque, arriving just in time to enjoy a late dinner at Frontier Restaurant, a hangout for college students and diners who think food tastes better under portraits of John Wayne.\n\nTake your time making the 90-minute drive north to Los Alamos. I stopped at the Walatowa Visitor Center at Jemez Pueblo the next morning for hot coffee and a history lesson on some of the Native Americans who developed this area.\n\nFor those seeking a more relaxing pit stop, meander around Jemez Springs, a village crammed with inns, spas and art galleries. Drivers skittish about the winding road ahead — it's a roller-coaster ride that may make your stomach your churn — may want to book a massage.\n\nOr you can steady your nerves after you arrive in Los Alamos with lunch at Blue Window Bistro. The spacious restaurant serves a tart strawberry lemonade and a New Mexico dip sandwich so tender that the au jus seemed redundant.\n\nBefore making the 90-minute drive on to Taos, the tourist town where folk art is treated like Michelangelo, I paused at Ashley Pond, across the street from the Oppenheimer sites. It's a picturesque park that wouldn't be out of place in a Frank Capra movie. It doesn't play a significant role in history, but it's a pleasant place in Los Alamos to clear your just-blown mind."

        "text": "The movie event of the summer has officially arrived. There's just one problem: It's basically impossible to get good seats.\n\nSince its premiere last weekend, tickets for Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer have been selling fast. But while it's easy for any schmuck to see the epic biopic in digital, Nolan has made it clear that the best way to see his film is in IMAX 70mm — a format that only 30 locations in the U.S. are capable of playing. The exclusivity has made this the most coveted movie ticket of the summer, with fans willing to pay hundreds of dollars for a chance to see the movie in its intended format.\n\nCillian Murphy in 'Oppenheimer'. Universal Pictures\n\nOn Monday, a Craigslist post selling eight 70mm IMAX tickets for the whopping price of $1,400 went viral on social media. The seats in a Midtown Manhattan theater were in the fourth row, \"perfect center\" and could not be sold separately.\n\nThe post has since been deleted (leaving us to wonder if someone really spent more than a grand on movie tickets), but plenty more tickets are being resold and requested on third-party websites like Craigslist and eBay.\n\nOne eBay sale lists two mid-August tickets with a starting bid of $499. Over on Craigslist, there are a few reasonably-priced tickets — like a fair $20 for IMAX seats in Grand Rapids, Mich. — while others bump the price significantly. Some fans are even posting Wanted ads, seeking out those willing to part with their tickets.\n\n\"Will pay over retail up to $150+ for good seats and date,\" wrote one anonymous Bay Area user. Elsewhere, a New Yorker is requesting two seats for any Aug. 6 showing, promising to pay a total of $300.\n\nStarring Cillian Murphy, Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt, and Robert Downey Jr, the movie tells the story of Robert J. Oppenheimer (Murphy), long known as \"the Father of the Atomic Bomb.\" Despite not having the franchise or family appeal of most summer blockbusters, the film cracked $80.5 million in its opening weekend. The phenomenon is partially due to the Barbenheimer craze, which involves pairing the biopic with Barbie for a bizarre double feature.\n\nIn a promo for the film, the cast and crew made a point of highlighting the allure of seeing the film on the biggest screen possible.\n\n\"Oppenheimer's story is one of the biggest stories imaginable,\" Nolan said. \"Our film tries to take you into his experience, and IMAX for me is a portal into a level of emotion that you can't get from other formats.\"\n\nThe filmmaker continued, \"IMAX 70mm is the highest-quality imaging format that's ever been devised. It allows you to fully immerse yourself in the story. When the audience is able to see this in IMAX, on the big screen, they will be able to experience an extraordinary moment in human history.\"\n\nWant more movie news?

        "text": "MUMBAI, July 24 (Reuters) - A scene featuring a holy Hindu scripture in nuclear arms biopic \"Oppenheimer\" has drawn social media fire in India, with many users saying they would boycott the movie because of what one nationalist group called a \"scathing attack on Hinduism\".\n\nThe scene features the protagonist reciting a verse from the Bhagwad Gita, considered the holiest of Hindu scripture, just before sexual intercourse.\n\nThe film, which was released in India on Friday with much fanfare, was rated by the Central Board of Film Certification U/A, which recommends parental guidance for viewers aged under 12.\n\n\"This should be investigated... on an urgent basis and those involved should be severely punished,\" the nationalist \"Save Culture Save India Foundation\" said in a press release. Comments by the organisation's founder, government official Uday Mahurkar, condemning the movie were also retweeted more than 3,600 times.\n\nCast members Trond Fausa Aurvag, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Jason Clarke, Director Christopher Nolan and his wife Emma Thomas, and Producer Charles Roven pose during a photocall before the premiere of the film \"Oppenheimer\" at the Grand Rex in Paris, France, July 11, 2023.

        "text": "UPDATE: A big weekend at the box office with something for everyone and notable milestones including Barbie crossing the $1B global mark while Oppenheimer topped $550M, as we noted earlier. In new plays, Meg 2: The Trench opened to a strong $142M global and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem started rollout with $8.5M in just 30% of its offshore footprint (global was $51.6M). Meanwhile, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is nearing $500M worldwide and Insidious: The Red Door has become the top-grossing horror movie of the year at $182.5M.\n\nAlso in the mix, Disney crossed $4B worldwide, the first studio to do so this year.

For more on Barbie, see here.\n\nUniversal’s Oppenheimer is now at an estimated $553M through Sunday, the fifth biggest Christopher Nolan title of all time. The overseas weekend was $52.8M (-31%) for an offshore cume of $324.4M which is above Dunkirk, Interstellar, Tenet and The Dark Knight Rises at the same point. This is the top Nolan movie ever in 46 markets including the Netherlands, India, Saudi Arabia, Belgium, Norway & the UAE.\n\nIn IMAX, Oppenheimer has now joined the format’s global Top 10 releases of all time at No. 8 and with a running total of $114.2M. It’s also the biggest Nolan movie ever in IMAX. At $49.6M internationally, this is the 4th highest ever IMAX title in like-for-like markets.\n\nOverall, the Top 5 markets to date are the UK ($50.3M), Germany ($28.3M), France ($24.2M), Australia ($18.2M) and India ($16.1M).

The sequel was No. 1 in 23 offshore hubs, including China, Spain, Indonesia, Taiwan and Mexico as well as in the Middle Eastern region.\n\nIn like-for-like markets and using today’s exchange rates, the film is tracking on par with Godzilla: King of the Monsters, 5% over The Meg, 6% above Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, 11% above Pacific Rim: Uprising and 12% over Rampage.\n\nIn Latin America, the 3D share was a great 21% while the movie opened ahead of M:I7 by 20% and 107% above Indiana Jones 5. In Malaysia and Thailand, it scored the biggest WB opening of 2023.\n\nThe top debut was China at $53.3M and boosted by the presence of action star Wu Jing. The results are 8% over Jurassic World Dominion, 11% better than the original Meg, 41% above Rise of the Beasts and 109% over M:I7.\n\nMexico was next with $7.6M at No. 1 and above comps.

In Spain, the No. 1 launch of $3.4M topped The Meg by 50% and was more than double the start of Kong: Skull Island.\n\nAlso getting going was Paramount’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem with the first 24 markets releasing this session for $8.5M. The UK ($5M) and Germany ($1M) were the only majors. Markets yet to open include France, Mexico and China this week, followed by Spain and Brazil in August and Australia, Korea and Japan in September.\n\nIn holdover news, Paramount/Skydance’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One added $17.6M in 69 markets, a drop of 45%. The overseas cume is $342.8M for $493.8M global. Top markets are China ($47.6M) Korea ($30.3M), the UK ($29.7M), Japan ($21.3M) and France ($20.4M).\n\nDisney/Pixar’s Elemental added $14.2M, a great hold of -29%, from 51 markets for an international cume of $275.4M and a global take of $423.7M. Italy notably saw a 28% hike versus last frame. Japan was new this session at $2.3M ahead of the Obon holidays and the 2nd best opening weekend of all Disney/Pixar animation films since the start of the pandemic era. Social scores are ahead of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Inside Out and Encanto.\n\nTop 5 markets to date are Korea ($48.1M), Mexico ($20.1M), France ($18.9M), UK ($18.2M) and China ($15.9M).\n\nMISC UPDATED CUMES/NOTABLE\n\nHaunted Mansion (DIS): $4.2M intl weekend (37 markets); $17.6M intl cume/$59.6M global\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (DIS): $4.2M intl weekend (52 markets); $197.8M intl cume/$368.4M global\n\nTransformers: Rise of the Beasts (PAR): $2.9M intl weekend (38 markets); $276.7M int cume/$433.7M global\n\nInsidious: The Red Door (SNY): $2.5M intl weekend (59 markets);$101.8M intl cume/$182.5M global\n\nThe Super Mario Bros Movie (UNI): $997K intl weekend (81 markets); $778.6M intl cume/$1.353B global\n\nPREVIOUS, SATURDAY UPDATE: It is incredible, and incredibly encouraging, to see that here we are with yet another amazing weekend at the global and international box office. To wit: the third week of Warner Bros’ Barbie continues to reign tall as she surfs towards the coveted $1B milestone this weekend. Through Friday, the Greta Gerwig-directed pic is at $951.M worldwide including $527.7M from 69 overseas markets in release.\n\nWhat’s more, as noted previously, Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer has reached the $500M global milestone, on its way to an estimated $551M through Sunday. (See more here)\n\nOn Barbie, the Top 5 to date are the UK ($80.6M), Mexico ($46.6M), Brazil ($37.2M), Australia ($36M) and, somewhat improbably, China ($30.1M).\n\nMeanwhile, WB’s China coproduction Meg 2: The Trench is now in 75 markets and has grossed $46M through Friday after a strong $34M Friday. That includes a terrific $20.5M start in China at No. 1 yesterday, on par with Kong: Skull Island, and ahead of the original Meg (+37%) as well as more recent comps like Transformers: Rise of the Beasts and Mission 7.\n\nCMC releases the movie in China where today it was overtaken by a local total in preview release. The social and critical scores in China on Meg 2 are higher than the original, but it’s getting beat in presales for the next several days.\n\nMORE…\n\nPREVIOUS FRIDAY: As she heads into the third weekend of release, Warner Bros’ Barbie has hit two new milestones, crossing both $500M at the international box office and the nine-century mark worldwide. The Greta Gerwig-directed phenomenon added $16.8M from 69 offshore markets on Thursday, bringing the overseas total to $509.7M through yesterday. Globally, the doll is standing tall with $916.1M as she looks to rollerblade past $1B this weekend.\n\nThe Top 5 markets to date for the Margot Robbie-starrer are the UK ($77.3M), Mexico ($45.8M), Brazil ($36.5M), Australia ($34.3M) and China ($29.5M).\n\nSpeaking of China, Warner Bros’ co-production Meg 2: The Trench has taken its first bites at the international box office, grossing $11.5M through Thursday in 57 markets. The giant shark also swam into China today, opening with an estimated RMB 146.1M ($20.4M). That figure is not included in the numbers through Thursday and while there is not yet a Maoyan audience score in the market, the ticketing platform is predicting an RMB 1B ($140M) finish across the full run.\n\nThe first Meg installment was a surprise summer hit when it opened in August 2018. Jason Statham returns here while massive Chinese action star Wu Jing joins the proceedings. Ben Wheatley directs the story of a research team taking on countless creatures whose deep-water habitat is being invaded. Jon Hoeber & Erich Hoeber and Dean Georgari are screenwriters.\n\nThursday for the pic was worth $8.1M. Latin American markets opened strong with the film ranking No. 1 for the region, topping the opening days of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny by 134%, Pacific Rim: Uprising by 94% and Godzilla: King of the Monsters by 51% as well as coming in roughly on par with The Meg.\n\nThe top plays to date are France with $2M in the first two days, followed by Mexico with $1.4M on Thursday at No. 1 and above Kong: Skull Island (+4%), Godzilla: King of the Monsters (+8%), Transformers: Rise of the Beasts (+29%), Rampage (+30%) and nearly triple the opening day of Indiana Jones 5. Germany at $1.1M was double the first day of the original and is 6% above Indy 5, 42% over Rise of the Beasts and 32% over the first day of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One. Italy is tracking ahead of most comps including the original, Indy 5 and M:I7. Indonesia is next up with $537K while Netherlands debuted on Thursday with a strong 3D share of 54%. Opening day results are 19% above The Meg, 27% ahead of King of the Monsters, 49% over Mission 7 and 52% ahead of Jurassic World Dominion.\n\nA further 18 markets release today, including Spain, the UK and China.\n\nChristopher Nolan’s epic Oppenheimer is, meanwhile, on its way across the $500M mark globally with $478.8M through Thursday. Yesterday’s offshore gross was $10.6M, lifting the international box office cume to $278.9M.\n\nIn the UK, the through-Thursday total on the Universal film is $43.1M, in line with Dunkirk. Germany is next best with a running cume of $23M, performing 15% above The Dark Knight Rises and surpassing the lifetime of The Dark Knight, having already overtaken the lifetimes of Dunkirk, Interstellar and Tenet. France has a market cume to date of $21M, which is 11% above The Dark Knight Rises and has surpassed the full run of The Dark Knight. Australia is now at $15.3M, 58% above Dunkirk, having surpassed the lifetimes of Interstellar and Tenet. India has a running total of $14.7M, having already surpassed the lifetimes of all Nolan comps. The title is the 2nd biggest Hollywood movie of the year behind Fast X in that market.\n\nOther notable cumes include Mexico at $12.6M; Spain with $12.1M and performing above The Dark Knight Rises (+35%), having passed the lifetimes of Dunkirk, Interstellar and Tenet; Saudi Arabia at $9.3M which is bigger than the lifetime of all Nolan comps; and Netherlands where Oppenheimer has become Nolan’s biggest film ever, with $9.2M so far.\n\nMore to come throughout the weekend."

        "text": "New York CNN —\n\nOn the same day “Barbie” passed its billion-dollar box office milestone, the other half of the viral “Barbenheimer” phenomenon blew past the half-billion-dollar mark.\n\nSince its release three weeks ago, Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” has made $552.9 million worldwide, according to official estimates from Universal Pictures.\n\nIt is now the highest grossing R-rated movie of 2023, and “marks the fastest a Universal R-rated film has hit the $200 million threshold domestically,” the studio said in a news release Sunday. It’s also the highest grossing movie set during World War II, according to Universal.\n\nIn its third weekend, “Oppenheimer” has had incredible stamina as the No. 3 movie in both domestic and international box offices.\n\nNolan’s blockbuster has had “an astounding theatrical run made all the more impressive by the R-rating, running time and subject matter which, in the hands of a lesser filmmaker and absent a spectacular marketing and release strategy, would have likely wound up as a mere footnote when referencing the performance of historical dramas at the box office,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.\n\nThe box office numbers are impressive for a three-hour biography about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the Manhattan Project physicist. The movie is one of only four biopics to earn more than half a billion dollars globally, alongside “Bohemian Rhapsody,” “Passion of the Christ,” and “American Sniper.”\n\n“‘Oppenheimer’… (has) become one of the most revered, talked about and successful summer movies ever to be released by a major studio,” said Dergarabedian, adding the movie “demonstrates the power of great filmmaking and of course a bit of unforeseeable ‘Barbenheimer’ magic.”\n\n“Oppenheimer” and “Barbie” had a symbiotic relationship in the lead-up to their shared debut on July 21, perhaps helped by their very different styles and tones."

        "text": "'Barbie,' 'Oppenheimer' and 'The Last Voyage of the Demeter'\n\nBarbie continues to bedazzle everything in its path.\n\nThe Warner Bros. blockbuster grossed an estimated $33.7 million at the Aug. 11-13 box office in North America, the ninth-biggest fourth weekend of all time, ahead of Spider-Man: No Way Home ($32.6 million) and not far behind The Avengers ($36.7 million), not adjusted for inflation.\n\nBarbie easily stayed No. 1 as it zoomed past the $500 million mark domestically and $657 million overseas for an astounding global total of $1.18 billion, good enough to pass up Aquaman and rank as the No. 2 Warners film of all time behind the final Harry Potter pic.\n\nSony’s Gran Turismo: Based on a True Story was supposed to have opened domestically, but the pic’s release was delayed by two weeks because of the SAG-AFTRA strike. That meant little competition, considering that Amblin and Universal’s genre Dracula pic The Last Voyage of the Demeter got lost at sea with a dismal $6.5 million domestic opening. Gran Turismo did kick off its international rollout, however, grossing $10.7 million from its first 30 markets.\n\nIt was another eventful week for the female-fueled Barbie. Gerwig now ranks as the highest-grossing female director of all time domestically after her movie skated past Frozen II, which was helmed by Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck. Gerwig is also celebrating becoming the highest-grossing female director of a live-action movie at the worldwide box office after Barbie passed up Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck’s superhero pic Captain Marvel, which earned $1.13 billion worldwide in 2019.\n\nThere’s more: Barbie will soon pass up The Dark Knight‘s $534 million to become the top-grossing Warners release of all time in North America after finishing Sunday with a domestic haul of $526.3 million, unadjusted.\n\nUniversal’s Oppenheimer, directed by Christopher Nolan, likewise continues to impress in its fourth weekend, earning $18.8 million for a domestic cume north of $264 million. Overseas, it earned another $31.9 million for a huge worldwide total of $649 million, making it Nolan’s fifth-biggest film.\n\nBarbie and Oppenheimer fell a scant 36 and 35 percent, respectively, as they continued to dominate the upper reaches of the chart. Put another way, Barbenheimer is living the dream.\n\nParamount’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem overtook Meg 2: The Trench to come in No. 3 in its second weekend with an estimated $15.8 million for a domestic total of $72.8 million through Sunday. The film fell only 44 percent. TMNT‘s early global total is $94.7 million.\n\nMeg 2 slipped 58 percent to an estimated $12.7 million for a domestic cume of $54.1 million, notably behind the first film at the same point in that movie’s run. The shark sequel is doing far more business overseas, where it bit off another $43.7 million this weekend for a foreign cume of $202.8 million and a rousing $256.9 million globally.\n\nThe big downer of the weekend was The Last Voyage of Demeter from Amblin and Universal, although the film’s budget was reportedly capped at around $45 million. It is the second Dracula-centric film of 2023 to have little bite after Renfield, also released by Universal.\n\nDirected by André Ovredal, Last Voyage of Demeter is based on a chapter from Bram Stoker’s classic novel Dracula about the merchant ship Demeter, which was chartered to transport 50 unmarked wooden crates from Carpathia to London, but there is no trace of the crew when it arrives. Corey Hawkins plays a doctor who joins the ship for its passage. Aisling Franciosi also stars.\n\nDemeter wasn’t expected to be a big August grosser, meaning that summer domestic revenue still has a shot of hitting $4 billion, thanks in large measure to the ongoing strength of Barbenheimer.\n\nTMNT, Meg 2 and the Last Voyage of Demeter underscore the perils of having to open a summer movie amid the dual strikes. WGA and SAG-AFTRA rules prohibit writers and actors from promoting any movie, TV or streaming program from a struck company.\n\nElsewhere in the top 10, Disney’s ill-fated Haunted Mansion fell to No. 5 in its third weekend with $5.6 million for a domestic total of $53 million and $76 million globally. (None of the movie’s stars could attend the Disneyland premiere due to the strike.)\n\nA24’s Talk to Me placed No. 6 in its third weekend with $5.1 million for a domestic cume of $31.2 million, a respectable number for a specialty title.\n\nAngel Studios’ Sound of Freedom crossed the $170 million mark domestically in its sixth weekend with $4.8 million for a cume of $172.8 million.\n\nAug. 13, 7:40 a.m.: Updated with revised weekend estimates.\n\nAug. 13, 9 a.m.: Updated with revised weekend estimates."

        "text": "Are Christopher Nolan movies too loud? It’s a question that’s asked every time the director releases a movie, and “Oppenheimer” is no exception. Nolan’s sound mix is once again a point of contention among viewers, with some complaining that it’s hard to understand the dialogue against Ludwig Göransson’s booming score and other sound design choices. In a recent interview with Insider, Nolan explained that one reason it may be hard to hear the dialogue in “Oppenheimer” is because he refuses to re-record his actors in post-production.\n\n“I like to use the performance that was given in the moment rather than the actor re-voice it later,” Nolan said. “Which is an artistic choice that some people disagree with, and that’s their right.”\n\nNolan refuses to record ADR, so whatever vocal takes he gets on the day of filming are what go into the film’s theatrical cut. That can be a risk in a movie like “Oppenheimer” considering the IMAX cameras used to shoot the film are incredibly loud on set, although Nolan said they are getting better.\n\n“There are certain mechanical improvements,” Nolan said. “And actually, Imax is building new cameras right now which are going to be even quieter. But the real breakthrough is in software technology that allows you to filter out the camera noise. That has improved massively in the 15 or so years that I’ve been using these cameras. Which opens up for you to do more intimate scenes that you would not have been able to do in the past.”\n\nWhatever dialogue issues some “Oppenheimer” viewers are having with the film aren’t stopping moviegoers from flocking to see the atomic bomb epic. “Oppenheimer” has soared past the $400 million mark at the worldwide box office in less than two weeks of release, a huge accomplishment for a three-hour biopic that’s rated R. The film is expected to have grossed more than $200 million domestically by the end of its third weekend in release."

        "text": "Christopher Nolan’s hit film “Oppenheimer” rides on the slight but sturdy shoulders of Irish actor Cillian Murphy.\n\nAnd that’s Cillian with a hard K – get to know it.\n\nMurphy’s performance as physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who led development of the atomic bomb that ended World War II, is one that may explode his fame, going from “I know I’ve seen him somewhere” status to Oscar-contending familiar face.\n\nNot that Murphy, 47, is eager for the spotlight to grow hotter.\n\n“Honestly, this may sound predictable, but I don’t think about that sort of stuff,” Murphy told USA TODAY in an interview before the start of the Screen Actors Guild strike. “It’s not going to do you any good. I just think about the work.”\n\nHere’s a primer on one of this summer’s acting supernovas:\n\nWho is Cillian Murphy?\n\nMurphy grew up in a suburb of Cork, Ireland, and was active in plays as a teen. He first appeared on the big screen in 2001 in the film adaptation of an Irish play he starred in called “Disco Pigs.”\n\nThat was followed a year later by a haunting performance in Danny Boyle’s zombie thriller “28 Days Later.” Murphy has appeared in about 50 movies and half a dozen television shows.\n\nIn 2004, Murphy married his longtime girlfriend, Yvonne McGuinness; the couple have two teenage sons. Murphy and his family live in Dublin, deliberately far from Hollywood. He is notoriously shy of the red carpet and prefers the relative anonymity of his native Ireland.\n\nWhat is Cillian Murphy’s biggest role to date?\n\nIf there’s a hint of recognition from movie and TV fans when they see Murphy’s face, that’s probably because of his star turn in the Netflix series “Peaky Blinders,” a drama based on the exploits of a British crime gang that operated after World War I. Murphy played Thomas Shelby, leader of the Birmingham flat cap brigade, in the series, which was among Netflix's most popular at the time.\n\nHave Cillian Murphy and Christopher Nolan collaborated before?\n\nMany times. In fact, Murphy has been a go-to pick for Nolan in six movies, but this latest, “Oppenheimer,” is the first time Murphy has taken the lead role.\n\nTheir collaborations include Murphy’s performance as the Scarecrow in three Batman movies, “Batman Begins” (2005), “The Dark Knight” (2008) and “The Dark Knight Rises” (2012).\n\nIn 2010, Murphy played the role of a business tycoon’s heir in “Inception,” and in 2017 he played a shell-shocked solider in the World War II historical epic “Dunkirk.”\n\nWhy did Christopher Nolan pick Cillian Murphy for the role of Oppenheimer?\n\nNolan says he never writes a movie script with specific actors in mind. But when he was staring at the cover of the book “American Prometheus” by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin, from which “Oppenheimer” is adapted, he knew who his leading man would be.\n\n“I saw that photo (of Robert Oppenheimer) on the cover of the book, with that intense blue-eyed stare, and I thought, 'I know who can do this,' ” Nolan says. “I called him and said: ‘This is the one. You’ll take center stage and carry the audience with you.’ ”\n\nMurphy at first was terrified, Nolan says. In a good way. “He was frightened to just the right degree. He knew he had to do a lot of work, and you’re looking for that in an artist. I didn’t want an imitation. I was looking for our interpretation of this man.”\n\nWhat was Cillian Murphy’s reaction to seeing 'Oppenheimer' for the first time?\n\nMurphy says he was “emotionally winded” after screening the completed three-hour film, which was shot in 70mm IMAX.\n\n“I was knocked out really. It’s hard to take it all in,” he says. “It was a movie that I felt grabbed me by the throat and didn’t let go for three hours. I believe it’s Chris’s magnum opus.”\n\nWill Murphy see 'Barbie,' the other part of the 'Barbenheimer' blockbuster movie weekend?\n\n“For sure, 100%,” Murphy says. “I’m a fan of (“Barbie” director) Greta Gerwig, of (lead actress Margot) Robbie and Ryan (Gosling, who plays Ken).”\n\nMurphy says his teenage sons “keep showing me these things on social media where people are saying they’re going to go to one movie and then straight into the other, and I think that’s just great for our industry.”\n\nThe 'Barbenheimer’ phenomenon:How a movie meme inspired the 'crazy, weird' double feature\n\nWhat’s next for Cillian Murphy?\n\nMurphy has produced and acts in an upcoming movie called “Small Things Like These,” based on the award-winning historical novel by Irish writer Claire Keegan.\n\nThe movie follows a small-town Irish coal merchant, Bill Furlong (Murphy), who on a delivery to a convent discovers a haunting secret that forces him to confront his own and his town’s past.\n\nWith that wrapped up, might a relaxing break be next for the exacting actor, whose on-set intensity echoes that of British-born and Ireland-homesteading acting giant, three-time Oscar winner Daniel Day-Lewis?\n\n“I’m not great at taking vacations, man,” Murphy says. “But maybe that’s why I only do a film a year. It takes too much out of me.”"

        "text": "In a dazzling showcase of movie marketing mastery, the much-anticipated summer movie releases of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” shattered expectations for the film industry, transforming an opening weekend into an unprecedented blockbuster phenomenon.\n\nCombining the charm of a beloved doll with the captivating story of a visionary physicist, the two films broke records worldwide. Their rise to box office record-breaking numbers—“Barbie” pulling in $155 million and “Oppenheimer” making $82.4 million in their opening weekends—can be attributed to innovative and multifaceted marketing strategies.\n\nClaudia Townsend, associate professor of marketing in the University of Miami Patti and Allan Herbert Business School, weighed in on the perfect storm that touted massive success in the theater by addressing some queries about the movies and their marketing strategies.\n\nThe release of Barbie and Oppenheimer, or “Barbenheimer,” as social media dubs the films, has had tremendous success. Why such a phenomenon?\n\nIt’s pretty interesting; usually, big movies do not try to release on the same day. Universal was coming out with “Oppenheimer” and Warner Brothers was coming out with “Barbie.” At first it was a question of which movie studio was going to change the date of release. Neither of them backed down. However, from a marketing point of view, that made sense. This is an example of counter-programming. One of the essential ideas of marketing is that a product, in this case a movie, has a target audience. And other products that may be in the same category but not going after the same target audience are not really competing with you. “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” are a great example of this as they have very different target audiences. And so, that meant that these movies really aren’t competing. Barbie’s audience is mostly female, and mostly younger, with 75 percent being younger than age 29. Oppenheimer’s audience is mostly male, and skews to an older clientele. The movies aren’t competing because they really aren’t going after the same people. Given this, it’s OK for them to release on the same day. But then, because they’re both such big movies with huge marketing budgets behind them, it actually created a moment and created a phenomenon, where the two movies together are bigger than the sum of their parts. So, by creating this Barbenheimer phenomenon, people are now talking about going to see both movies. You’re getting people who might have just seen “Barbie” also going to “Oppenheimer,” and people who might have only seen “Oppenheimer” also going to “Barbie.”\n\nAnd then there’s this additional effect, which is to say, since COVID-19, the movie theaters have been desperate to get people back inside. There was this first moment around “Top Gun” that was kind of the first big movie after COVID-19, where consumers were going to the movie theaters in large numbers. And again, that was because there was this cultural moment around it. And now Barbenheimer is doing that again. People want to be a part of the conversation. Not only are people watching the movies, but they’re not waiting to see them at home. So, really, it’s kind of this perfect storm.\n\nA nostalgia factor may have driven audiences to see “Top Gun.” What kind of factors are driving the fan craze behavior for these two films?\n\n“Barbie” is the bigger movie for two reasons. First is that the marketing budget behind it was much bigger. “Oppenheimer,” while it is a big blockbuster movie and it’s got a lot of marketing behind it, is potentially benefiting more from being associated with “Barbie.”\n\nSecond, like “Top Gun,” the success of “Barbie” will be in part due to nostalgia. “Barbie” is a good example of where much of the film industry is focusing its attention right now. Movies are expensive and studios are investing in movies that have a preexisting built-in audience. That’s why you see the Marvel movies or other movies using characters that already have a built-in fan base. Barbie is a global brand. Everyone knows Barbie. But what’s interesting about “Barbie” is that, while people have strong feelings about Barbie, not everyone loves Barbie.\n\nThere has been generations of people saying, “I don't know if I want my daughter playing with Barbie.” The movie has done a really good job of addressing that. The movie couldn’t be about how great Barbie is. It also couldn’t just be bashing Barbie. It manages to thread the needle. The movie is really kind of upholding Barbie and what she stands for, but also addressing why people may not like her. Particularly for females, everyone knows about her and has some relationship with her. More often than not these days, we see movies being made where the studios can count on an audience going because there’s some history there. It’s very similar to the reason movie studios want to put a big-name star in their film. The star draws an audience. Barbie is a really big celebrity.\n\nWhat kind of tactics did they use, especially on social media, that drove this craziness that movie marketers will probably look to emulate moving forward?\n\nYou wouldn’t be crazy to think that Barbie is a lifestyle brand. Meaning that right now, Barbie is in fashion, Barbie is in makeup, Barbie is in décor, Barbie is in travel. Right now, Barbie owns the color pink.\n\nI think the marketing lesson is probably less about the movie but more about what you can do with a product and a moment. Along with the huge marketing budget behind this movie there was already this built-in base of understanding who Barbie is and what she stands for. There’s so much more to it than the movie when we see brands coming out with pink clothing or Barbie makeup. They’re referencing the movie because of the moment but they’re also referencing the bigger brand and the doll.\n\nIs there anything else you want to add about the roll out of these movies and the significant impact that it has had on the movie industry?\n\nWe should consider Mattel’s role. The “Barbie” movie comes out of the toy company’s new film division. By creating this movie, the Barbie IP is now so much more valuable. What they have done has been enormously effective. Barbie is having a cultural moment and the meaning of Barbie is currently bigger than the actual product. This is marketing gold.\n\nI think from the marketing perspective what’s interesting here is that Mattel has done something really difficult. We talked about brand positioning and what a brand stands for. Repositioning a brand is very difficult. Right now, Mattel is revamping and repositioning Barbie, without losing her original identity. She had this original identity of being pretty and pink but also kind of unattainable and potentially making people feel bad about themselves. I think what happened here was that Mattel really listened to the consumer, who for years had been kind of unhappy with Barbie. And Mattel tried to address the shortcomings of the product with the movie. In doing so, Mattel repositioned the brand. Barbie now has been repositioned to be a kind of feminist icon, and that's difficult to do. Reinventing a brand is incredibly difficult. That’s something that requires not just money, but great strategy. And it seems like they’ve been able to do that."

        "text": "Cillian Murphy is earning some of the best reviews of his career for leading Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer, but no praise might be higher than this rave from co-star Robert Downey Jr.: “I have never witnessed a greater sacrifice by a lead actor in my career,” the “Iron Man” star told People magazine about Murphy’s performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer.\n\n“He knew it was going to be a behemoth ask when Chris called him,” Downey Jr. added. “But I think he also had the humility that is required to survive playing a role like this. We’d be like, ‘Hey, we got a three-day weekend. Maybe we’ll go antiquing in Santa Fe. What are you going to do?’ ‘Oh, I have to learn 30,000 words of Dutch. Have a nice time.’ But that’s the nature of the ask.”\n\n“Oppenheimer” shot for 57 days, one of Nolan’s quickest film shoots, and Murphy is front and center in nearly every scene. The cast and crew lived together in the same hotel during the film’s production, but Murphy never joined his fellow ensemble for dinner due to the intensity of playing the lead role.\n\n“Of course he didn’t want to come and have dinner with us,” Matt Damon previously told People magazine. “He couldn’t. His brain was just too full.”\n\nEmily Blunt reasoned that Murphy did not attend cast dinners because “the sheer volume of what he had to take on and shoulder is so monumental.”\n\nFor Murphy, “Oppenheimer” marks the biggest leading role of his film career thus far. That kind of pressure isolated the actor. “You know that when you have those big roles, that responsibility, you feel it’s kind of overwhelming,” he told People.\n\nMurphy also lost weight for the role, although he has not disclosed how much. The actor stars in the film as theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who was tasked with leading the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico in the effort to create the atomic bomb. Downey Jr. stars as Lewis Strauss, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission who later persecuted Oppenheimer for being a Soviet spy.\n\n“Chris had one of the most incredible leads in Cillian,” Florence Pugh added to People. “He is an actor that I have been watching for quite some time and have been desperate to work with for ages. You’d have to be mad to say no. It was truly one of the best experiences that I’ve had.”\n\n“Working with him was hugely impressive,” she added. “Every single day he shows up knowing every single possible way, intonation, inflection of how to bring this character to life. That was hugely impressive to me. There’s a reason why he is one of the greats.”\n\n“Oppenheimer” is now playing in theaters nationwide from Universal Pictures."

        "text": "Fans of \"Oppenheimer\" may find it difficult to visit the Trinity Site, the location of the world's first nuclear bomb detonation as featured in Christopher Nolan's latest film, released in theaters July 21.\n\nThe Trinity Site, located within White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, is only open to visitors two days each year: Oct. 21, 2023, and April 6, 2024.\n\nIn a statement by the United States Army, which operates the White Sands Missile Range, visitors were warned that \"due to the release of the movie Oppenheimer in July, we are expecting a larger than normal crowd at the 21 October open house.\"\n\nThose hoping to get a rare glimpse of Ground Zero of the Nuclear Age \"may experience wait times of up to two hours,\" the statement reads.\n\n\"If you are not one of the first 5,000 visitors,\" the Army advises, you might not make it through the Missile Range's Stallion Gate before closing at 2 p.m. The Trinity Site closes promptly at 3:30 p.m. on Oct. 21. The Stallion Gate, outside of San Antonio, New Mexico, is around a three-hour drive from El Paso.\n\nOppenheimer age rating\n\nThe Oppenheimer movie is about the creation of the world's first nuclear weapon and deals with themes of war and violence. For this heavy subject matter, along with nudity, some sexual content, and explicit language, the film is rated R.\n\nOppenheimer run time\n\nIf you want to catch a screening of Oppenheimer before you try your luck at the Trinity Site in October, be prepared for a movie run time even longer than the expected wait to get into the Missile Range: Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer movie is three hours long.\n\nWhat is at Trinity Site, New Mexico?\n\nThe Trinity Site was chosen as a test location for the world's most deadly weapon by researchers like J. Robert Oppenheimer at the Los Alamos National Laboratory for its isolated desert environment. The landscape is as stark and empty as it was on July 16, 1945, when the bomb was tested.\n\nNow an obelisk marks the exact location of the detonation, as well as some historical photographs and samples of trinitite — an extremely rare and \"glasslike substance that was created from the sand and other materials ... during the intense heat of that first atomic test,\" according to the Los Alamos National Laboratory's Bradbury Science Museum.\n\nIs Trinity Site still radioactive?\n\nAfter the bomb's explosion in 1945, the military encircled the Trinity Site with chain-link fencing to keep both White Sands Missile Range personnel and the public away from dangerous radiation. Just eight years later in 1953, however, the radiation levels were deemed safe and the first public open houses of the area began.\n\nToday it is safe to visit the Trinity Site, a public affairs specialist with White Sands Missile Range assured the El Paso Times in a 2018 interview. \"If it wasn't,\" she added, \"we wouldn’t open it to the public.”\n\nMore:Have a blast: Trinity Site allows public to visit where first atomic bomb was tested\n\nWhy is the Trinity Site only open twice a year?\n\nAlthough the Trinity Site is a National Historic Landmark, representing \"an outstanding aspect of American history and culture,\" it is located within the White Sands Missile Range, a highly active and restricted site for the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nPublic access to the Trinity site is only open twice a year to comply with the military's frequent weapons testing at White Sands.\n\nMore:First atom bomb test: 'It was just like the sun had come up and suddenly gone down again'\n\nWhere to see Oppenheimer in El Paso\n\nMany theaters in El Paso are screening Oppenheimer, including Alamo Drafthouse locations in East El Paso and Montecillo and The Grand Theatre 10 in Fort Bliss.\n\nOppenheimer is only available for viewing in IMAX at the Premiere Lux Cine 17 in El Paso."

        "text": "J. Robert Oppenheimer, director of the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, N.M., in a 1944 photograph. (National Archives and Records Administration)\n\nTOKYO – When “Barbie,” the live-action movie about a plastic doll, opened Friday in Japan, it did so without “Oppenheimer,” the rival film with which it shared a bill in the United States.\n\n“Oppenheimer,” a biopic about the father of the atomic bomb, has no opening date in Japan, thus far, and Universal Studios has said nothing about the film coming to the only country targeted in anger with atomic weapons.\n\n“Barbie” arrived divorced from its trendy “Barbenheimer” partner, a phenomenon in July in the United States but a cultural faux pas in Japan.\n\nFilm distributors will consider whether the movie will turn a profit before deciding to show it in Japan, said Kazuhiro Maeshima, a professor of global studies at Sophia University in Tokyo by phone Thursday. Later openings in Japan for U.S. films are not unusual, he said.\n\n“They may decide that it’s better not to show it in Japan because of this reaction” to the “Barbenheimer” controversy, Maeshima said.\n\nThe two films were married on social media in a lighthearted, social-media meme called “Barbenheimer” that encouraged U.S. moviegoers to see the contrasting films in one day. Both movies opened July 21 in the U.S.\n\n‘Summer to remember’\n\n“Oppenheimer” is based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer, who led the U.S. project during World War II that was first to develop an atomic weapon.\n\nAn Internet meme in late July that grafted images of its star, Cillian Murphy, with one of Margot Robbie, star of “Barbie,” unleashed outrage in Japan for its apparent insensitivity.\n\nWarner Bros.’ official “Barbie” account on X, formerly known as Twitter, re-tweeted a fan-art poster showing Murphy’s Oppenheimer carrying Robbie as Barbie superimposed over a mushroom cloud.\n\n“It’s going to be a summer to remember,” declared the tweet, since deleted.\n\nWarner Bros. Japan was among the first to react.\n\n“We consider it extremely regrettable that the official account of the American headquarters for the movie ‘Barbie’ reacted to the social media postings of ‘Barbenheimer’ fans,” Warner Bros. Japan tweeted on the “Barbie” Japan account.\n\n“We take this situation very seriously. We are asking the U.S. headquarters to take appropriate action,” the tweet read. “We apologize to those who were offended by this series of inconsiderate reactions.”\n\nThe Warner Bros. Film Group the next day offered “a sincere apology” for “its recent insensitive social media engagement.”\n\nSachiko Ishikawa, a YouTuber from Tokyo who tries to demystify Japan by talking about its misconceptions, addressed the “Barbenheimer” flap in a video, “#Barbenheimer in Japan?!,” posted Wednesday.\n\n“It’s not that the memes weren’t a problem, but what made it all snowball was the response,” Ishikawa told Stars and Stripes by phone Thursday. “The memes would’ve happened regardless, but the backlash was caused by the ‘Barbie’ official X reply.”\n\nLiving memory\n\nSachiko Ishikawa, a YouTube video blogger from Tokyo, talks about the \"Barbenheimer\" controversy in Japan against a backdrop of the fan poster on Aug. 9, 2023. (Sachiko Ishikawa/YouTube)\n\nIshikawa said she found the Japanese attitude toward “Oppenheimer” interesting. The comments on her video focus less on the meme controversy and more on the history of the atomic bomb.\n\nPeople in Japan associate the atomic bomb and the mushroom cloud with an estimated 110,000 who died immediately and thousands more who suffered from the bombings, Maeshima said. Living survivors tell their stories to subsequent generations, so the atomic bombings are a reality for them, he said.\n\nThe Japanese are reminded of the bombings every August with the anniversaries of the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nBy contrast, in the U.S., the bombings are generally considered a good thing that quickly ended the war, and victims’ stories are reported less frequently, Maeshima said.\n\nEven if the movie reaches Japanese theaters, it may fall flat following the “Barbenheimer” incident, he said.\n\n“It depends on whether one can imagine the tragic situation the bombings have brought on people when thinking about the mushroom cloud,” he said."

        "text": "Not streaming, nor strikes, nor shell shock from the pandemic kept this July’s domestic box office down with studio tentpoles and a faith-based surprise movie racking up the second-best record for the month with $1.37 billion per Comscore.\n\nWarner Bros’ Barbie and Universal’s Oppenheimer were the No. 1 and 2 movies with $366.4M and $181.4M respectively.\n\nThe record July still belongs to 2011 which cashed in $1.39 billion. Get this, Warners also led that month as well with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 which made $318.5M of its $381M gross during July back then.\n\nThis July was so great, it was +20% over last July’s $1.14 billion and +6% from pre-pandemic 2019 which minted $1.29 billion.\n\n“July was incredible for people who love going to the movies in cinemas with friends and family,” said NATO’s President and CEO Michael O’Leary in statement.\n\n“This month now ranks as one of the top-performing Julys in the history of motion pictures,” he continued, “Consumer enthusiasm and excitement continues to grow as our partners in the creative community and at the studios continue to release a steady stream of compelling and entertaining movies across multiple genres, while theater owners take showmanship to the next level.\n\nAs we also told you, this past weekend’s domestic haul of $217M for all movies was a record for the final session of July.\n\n“This past weekend is also further evidence that the economic impact of high-quality movies cannot be measured simply by the opening weekend box office,” O’Leary added.\n\n“Most importantly, July highlights the special bond between the American public and movie theatres and the unique cultural moments they create that cannot be replicated elsewhere,” said the new NATO Boss.\n\nShaping out the rest of the top ten pics of July for the period of July 1-31: 3.) Angel Studios’ relentless Sound of Freedom ($151.3M), 4) Disney/Lucasfilm’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny ($143.9M), 5) Paramount/Skydance’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning – Part One ($140.4M), 6) Sony/Blumhouse’s Insidious: The Red Door ($78.5M), 7) Disney/Pixar’s Elemental ($64.6M), 8) Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse ($47.1), 9) Disney’s Haunted Mansion ($26.4M) and 10) Sony’s No Hard Feelings ($26.1M).\n\nWith the SAG-AFTRA strike already pushing big movies like Kraven the Hunter, Challengers and the next Ghostbusters out of 2023, and exhibition fearing a downturn at the B.O. come October should the actors’ sit-out continue, the guild’s National Executive Director and Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland told Deadline yesterday that despite that harsh impact, “we have to take a strong line.”\n\nWhile a supporter of exhibition, Crabtree-Ireland acknowledged that the sector is “obviously very challenged” however “we can’t allow theatrical exhibition to become a way that the studios are sort of fueling their businesses during our strike.”"

        "text": "Cillian Murphy is the star of Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer,” but is he ready to embrace the pink? Given the “Barbenheimer” craze that’s sweeping the nation, Murphy has naturally been asked a lot about Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie.” Omelete (via Cinéfilos) even asked the “Oppenheimer” actor if he’d play a Ken in a potential sequel to Gerwig’s now historic comedy blockbuster.\n\n“Sure, yeah. Let’s read the script, let’s have a conversation,” Murphy responded about playing Ken. “I can’t wait to see [‘Barbie’]. I can’t wait to see the movie. I think it’s great for cinema to get all these great movies happening this summer.”\n\n“Barbie” opened to a massive $162 million during its opening weekend, but “Oppenheimer” was no slouch. The film debuted to a huge $82 million, a staggering number considering Nolan’s latest is a talky, three-hour biographical drama that’s also rated R.\n\nNolan told IGN ahead of both films opening in theaters that “it’s terrific” to have two summer tentpoles being released together.\n\n“Summer, in a healthy marketplace, is always crowded, and we’ve been doing this a long time,” Nolan said. “I think for those of us who care about movies, we’ve been really waiting to have a crowded marketplace again, and now it’s here and that’s terrific.”\n\nMurphy agreed with Nolan, telling IGN: “I think it’s great. I mean, I’ll be going to see ‘Barbie.’ I can’t wait to see it. I think it’s just great for the industry and for audiences that we have two amazing films by amazing filmmakers coming out the same day. Could spend a whole day in the cinema, what’s better than that?”\n\nWhether or not Murphy becomes a Ken remains to be seen. For now, he’s still processing everything that went into becoming J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who created the atomic bomb during World War II. Murphy went through dramatic isolation periods and weight loss during filming, so much so that Robert Downey Jr. said he’s never seen an actor sacrifice more for a role than Murphy in “Oppenheimer.” Is Oppenheimer a hero or a villain? The discussion is a nuanced one for Murphy.\n\n“I do think that he believed it would be the weapon to end all wars,” Murphy recently told NME. “He thought that [having the bomb] would motivate countries to form a sort of nuclear world governance. He was naive.”\n\nMurphy added that Nolan helped him unlock the more nuanced parts of Oppenheimer’s character. “Chris used this amazing phrase,” he said. “We were talking about Oppenheimer’s arc and he said, ‘You know, he’s dancing between the raindrops morally.’ That unlocked something in my mind when I was preparing.”\n\n“Oppenheimer” is now playing in theaters nationwide from Universal Pictures."

        "text": "Alden Ehrenreich plays a Senate aide, a figure who is one of the many government workers standing behind and to the side of the head honchos helping to grease the wheels of power. He has been tasked with guiding Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) through Senate confirmation hearings on his nomination as Secretary of Commerce to President Eisenhower's cabinet. Ehrenreich is essentially a PR guy, a guide for Strauss and the audience through the tangled web of Cold War-era D.C. and the front-stabbing figures who have turned politics into a battlefield. He is, by design, not that important. Dozens of other nameless aides are waiting around the corner to do this job. Ehrenreich just so happens to be there at the right/wrong time.\n\nBeing an audience avatar is often a thankless role in any film, and it’s a trope that Nolan often struggles with. Discussions of process and ideas often weigh down his films and inserting a figure of relatable naivety into this risks disrupting the narrative flow. \"Oppenheimer\" often gets away with not having one during the glut of the story since it’s so heavily focused on conversations about science, ethics, and consequences. The scenes with Strauss and Ehrenreich are a break from this, an insight into a post-Oppenheimer world and how it has impacted the system that helped to create him in the first place. Ehrenreich is not unaware, nor is he expected to play catch-up with Strauss and company. Rather, he’s the constant reminder that scientists did not do what happened at Los Alamos alone. That he is unnamed and a fictional creation of Nolan (a sharp contrast to a film populated by real historical players) hammers home the disposability of such an aide. Ehrenreich’s job is to blend in, to keep a straight face against the peacocking Strauss. It’s a role that could, too, have disappeared into the background, but Ehrenreich knows that the best scene stealers are the ones who react to the carnage.\n\nEhrenreich, a character actor with the face of a 1950s leading man, has always excelled in parts where he tempers his natural charisma with a dash of something sharper. In \"Hail, Caesar!,\" he steals the show from one of the Coen Brothers’ starriest casts as Hobie Doyle, the adorably clueless singing cowboy the studio tries to reinvent as a Noel Coward-esque debonair leading man. He’s the safe port of sincerity in a storm of Hollywood cynicism. As the younger brother of the tempestuous Tetro in Francis Ford Coppola's indie drama, he is appealingly innocent yet imbued with the abrasive arrogance that only a dolt of a teenage boy could truly possess. Even in \"Solo: A Star Wars Story,\" the u nfairly maligned prequel of the new Disney/Lucasfilm era, Ehrenreich’s Han is less concerned with traditional hero expectations. Audiences seemed furious that he didn’t look or act exactly like Harrison Ford. Still, Ehrenreich understood the giddy enthusiasm of the pre-jaded space cowboy and how the character doesn’t work if he’s always cool (which Ford never was in the original trilogy, something fans often overlook.) The best Ehrenreich performances allow him to dig into humanity's absurdities and petty mundanities, offering either the freaky flipside or a welcome dose of warmth. It’s never as interesting to be cool when you can be weird, dark, or earnest."

Robert Oppenheimer, the mastermind behind the atomic bomb, with Cillian Murphy playing the titular American scientist.\n\nWhile most theaters around the world will be showing \"Oppenheimer\" — and \"Barbie\" — there has been some speculation about whether \"Oppenheimer\" will be shown in Japan because of its subject matter.\n\nIn August 1945, the United States used Oppenheimer's work to create a nuclear bomb to hit the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing over 200,000 people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill 'Oppenheimer' be in Japanese theaters?\n\nJapan hasn't completely banned \"Oppenheimer\" from its theaters, but neither is there a release date for the movie in the country.\n\nA Universal spokesperson told Variety in June that \"plans have not been finalized in all markets.\"\n\nThis suggests that Japanese audiences won't be able to see Nolan's movie at the same time as the rest of the world, as Toho-Towa — the biggest Japanese distributor of Hollywood films — has yet to decide on its release plans, per Variety.\n\nThankfully, Japanese audiences will soon be able to see the other big movie of the summer, \"Barbie,\" which arrives in the country on August 11.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Oppenheimer' is in theaters now\n\n\"Oppenheimer\" opens Friday in theaters across other countries, including the US and UK, where it will face off against \"Barbie\" at the box office.\n\nNolan recently confirmed that his own daughter, Flora, makes a cameo appearance as a girl whose face melts off during a dream sequence.\n\nThe director also told Insider that it was \"essential\" to film sex scenes for the first time in his career.\n\n\"When you look at Oppenheimer's life and you look at his story, that aspect of his life, the aspect of his sexuality, his way with women, the charm that he exuded, it's an essential part of his story,\" Nolan told Insider about the choice of including sex scenes."

        "text": "Cillian Murphy, the leading man in Oppenheimer who portrays the title character—a.k.a. “death, destroyer of worlds”—thinks he bought a sound system with his first big check.\n\n“I think I bought like a record player—or a sound system, cause record players weren’t as cool as they are now, were they?” Murphy told the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nMeanwhile, costar Matt Damon paid for his mother’s Ph.D. and bought his brother a car.\n\nChristopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer—a historical drama based on the 2005 biography American Prometheus—has been a record-breaking box office success. The film has brought in over $188 million in domestic ticket sales and $231 million worldwide since its opening on July 21. Oppenheimer leads Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and Matt Damon shared what they spent their first paychecks on in a recent interview with the THR.\n\nDamon, who portrays Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves, the director of the Manhattan Project, recalled that his first big check came in 1990 for a film called Rising Son. He made $25,000.\n\n“I bought my brother a car and put my mom through her Ph.D. program,” Damon said in the interview. “And that was a really cool feeling.”\n\nIn the late 1980s, Damon actually shared a bank account with his childhood friend Ben Affleck, when the two were starting their careers. The two met as kids in their hometown of Cambridge, Mass., and later teamed up on numerous projects, including Good Will Hunting, Field of Dreams, and Air.\n\n“It was unusual, but…we needed the money for auditions, for trips to New York, so that’s what the money was for,” Damon said in March on the Bill Simmons Podcast, hosted by The Ringer sports writer Simmons.\n\nWhen either of them booked a role, they funneled their earnings into the joint account for future audition costs. It was a kind of mentality of when one wins, so does the other, Affleck said in the same podcast interview.\n\nThe actors closed the account when they both began earning steady incomes. Damon’s estimated net worth was $55 million as of 2016, according to Forbes.\n\nBlunt, who portrayed Katherine “Kitty” Oppenheimer, the wife of the title character, used her first paycheck to move out of her parents’ home and rent an apartment. Blunt was listed as the sixth-highest-paid actress in 2020, earning $22.5 million, according to Forbes.\n\nWhereas the A-list leads of Oppenheimer could have demanded $10 million to $20 million on the open market, they reportedly elected to earn only $4 million apiece for the “privilege of working with Nolan,” Variety reported. Still, they will all receive back-end compensation, meaning they will profit from the film’s box-office success.\n\n‘Barbenheimer’ and the strike\n\nOppenheimer’s release was simultaneous with that of Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, and the Barbie-Oppenheimer social media craze (a.k.a. “Barbenheimer”) helped fuel $311 million in combined ticket sales. This made their joint opening weekend the fourth-highest-grossing domestic box office weekend in history, behind Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame, according to the New York Times, citing Box Office Mojo.\n\nSimilar to Damon, Barbie star Margot Robbie used the money from her Hollywood success to pay off her mother’s mortgage, who supported her financially while she was getting her start.\n\n“She’d take money out of the house mortgage and lend me money, so I always knew, ‘Oh, I’ve got to pay that back,’” Robbie told CBS Sunday Morning. “I have that piece of paper still. I kept it. Everything I owed my mom, I had it written down.”\n\n“One day, when I made enough money, I just paid that whole mortgage off completely,” she said.\n\nBut in the wake of Barbenheimer’s continued success, the Hollywood writers’ strike entered its third month and actors have been on strike for nearly three weeks. Release dates for movies like Dune 2 and Challengers (a tennis drama starring Zendaya) have been delayed, as well as new seasons of television series like White Lotus, The Last of Us, and Euphoria.\n\nThe Writers Guild union leaders said on Tuesday they were meeting with studio representatives to discuss restarting negotiations.\n\nThe New York Times recently reported that some of Hollywood’s megastars raised over $15 million for the strike fund, led by actors Meryl Streep and George Clooney. Other celebrities including Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Hugh Jackman, Dwayne Johnson, Nicole Kidman, Julia Roberts, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Oprah Winfrey each gave $1 million or more.\n\n“I remember my days as a waiter, cleaner, typist, even my time on the unemployment line,” Streep said in a statement. “In this strike action, I am lucky to be able to support those who will struggle in a long action to sustain against Goliath.”\n\n“We’ve stood on the shoulders of the likes of Bette Davis and Jimmy Cagney, and it’s time for our generation to give something back,” Clooney added.\n\n[Paragraph nine has been updated to clarify a quote from Ben Affleck about his attitude toward the mutual success of himself and Matt Damon.]"

        "text": "Ryan Knapp woke up before sunrise one morning in July and left his home in northern New Hampshire at 5:30 a.m. to catch a movie.\n\nIt wasn’t just any day at the cinema. In fact, it was a 14-hour round-trip journey that involved crossing two state lines by car, train and bus. That’s because Knapp wanted to see Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” the way the director intended: in Imax 70mm, a rare format crafted from Nolan’s film negative, with physical reels spanning 11 miles and weighing 600 pounds. It’s a movie nerd’s dream — but it’s only available on 30 screens worldwide, 19 of them in the U.S.\n\nSo Knapp trekked to Providence, R.I., for a 2 p.m. showing. The verdict? “It was definitely worth it.”\n\n“Oppenheimer,” an R-rated three-hour drama consisting mainly of people talking in rooms, is not the type of movie audiences typically clamor to see on premium screens. Yet Imax accounted for a whopping 20% of the film’s $180.4 million global opening. And the company’s share of the movie’s box office haul has increased each successive weekend, with the 70mm version raking in $17 million to date, an astounding figure for such a limited format.\n\nAudiences have flocked to Imax screens because they offer an experience that cannot be replicated at home, according to box office analyst Jeff Bock, and “when a Christopher Nolan film comes out, that is an event in and of itself.” Plus, premium large formats like Imax 70mm are “a cinephile argument that has now carried over into the mainstream.”\n\nAccording to Nolan, Imax 70mm is the ideal cinema experience because “the sharpness and the clarity and the depth of the image is unparalleled.” But there are serious limitations when it comes to bringing the format to a wider audience. For one, Imax has only 30 Imax film projectors in rotation worldwide, and it takes three days to create each print. Since most theaters have switched over completely to digital projection, the company worked for two years to evaluate, reinstall and fix Imax 70mm projectors, sending tech teams to every site to perfect the audiovisual components. With “Oppenheimer,” Imax oversaw the hiring of 50 film projectionists globally and helped develop the first-ever Imax 70mm black-and-white film, bringing some of Kodak’s more experienced personnel out of retirement in the process.\n\nDue to popular demand, Imax has twice extended “Oppenheimer’s” 70mm run. But on Sept. 1, exhibitors will have to cede those screens to Denzel Washington’s “The Equalizer 3.”\n\n“We really want to support Chris and the movie in every way we can, but we have to balance that with our other commitments,” says Richard Gelfond, CEO of Imax. “We’ll play it by ear and see where it goes.”\n\nMark Jafar, Imax’s global head of corporate communications, adds, “Imax 70mm film lasts, on average, 10 times longer than regular 70mm or 35mm film. Those prints are assets that we’ll be using for the next 20 years.” He’s confident that specialty theaters like BFI in London and AMC Lincoln Square in New York will bring back “Oppenheimer” in Imax 70mm for Nolan retrospectives.\n\nBut it might return even sooner. With theaters selling out more than three weeks in advance — and fans like Knapp road-tripping to their nearest Imax 70mm showing — it’s likely “Oppenheimer” will come back to premium large formats after moviegoers have checked out “The Equalizer 3.”\n\nAs Imax 70mm continues to permeate the mainstream and draw in younger auteurs like Jordan Peele and Damien Chazelle, Gelfond’s hope is to “find more projectors and refurbish them.”\n\n“It’s an art form that’s been fading away,” he says. “Imax is all in on trying to keep film alive.”\n\nWith $134 million generated from “Oppenheimer” alone, the premium film-tech company is largely responsible for bringing multiplexes out of the pandemic slump. “If Hollywood is going to invest in one thing,” says Bock, “it should have almost everything to do with Imax.”"

        "text": "UPDATE, SATURDAY August 19: Christopher Nolan and Universal’s Oppenheimer is on its way to yet another milestone, poised to cross $700M global through today. After five frames, the epic is expected to reach $718M with tomorrow’s numbers included. That will make it Nolan’s 4th highest-grossing film ever worldwide, overtaking Interstellar. It will also move into the No. 4 spot on the global chart for 2023 so far.\n\nThe international box office cume through tomorrow is projected at $432M after a $31.8M fifth session. Oppenheimer is the biggest Nolan film of all time at the international box office when restated to today’s dollars and excluding un-released markets.\n\nFor the year so far, the Cillian Murphy-starrer is the No. 3 movie overseas, excluding China where it releases on August 30. As previously noted, this is Nolan’s highest-grossing movie in 50 markets, and now his top non-superhero title in 63.\n\nThe Top 5 markets through Friday are the UK ($62.1M), Germany ($38.1M), France ($30.4M), Australia ($22.1M) and Spain ($17.8M). Also notable, Korea is seeing a big opening weekend with $10.4M through today.\n\nWe’ll have a full update on Sunday.\n\nPREVIOUS UPDATE, August 10: With today’s business, Christopher Nolan’s epic Oppenheimer will hit yet another benchmark, crossing $600M at the global box office. The latest milestone comes just 23 days into release.\n\nAdding $7.7M on Wednesday from 78 overseas markets, the Universal title’s international box office cume through yesterday is $350.7M. The worldwide total is $593.5M. Markets still to release include Vietnam (today) and Italy, Korea and China through the rest of August.\n\nAlready having surpassed Dunkirk as Nolan’s fifth-highest grossing film of all time globally this past weekend and becoming the biggest WWII movie ever worldwide (see previous post below), Oppenheimer is now the filmmaker’s top movie ever in 47 markets, including Germany, Netherlands, India, Belgium, Norway, the UAE, Poland and more. It’s also the best for Nolan outside the Batman franchise in 61 markets, including Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, Central America and the Philippines.\n\nThe Cillian Murphy-starrer has been seeing solid midweek play and, through Wednesday, is led by the UK with $53.4M, in line with Dunkirk (+1%) and The Dark Knight Rises (-7%) at the same point, having already surpassed the lifetimes of Inception, Interstellar and Tenet in the market.\n\nGermany has also advanced since Sunday, now at $31.5M through Wednesday when it surpassed the lifetime of The Dark Knight Rises to become the biggest Nolan film ever in the market.\n\nFrance has grossed $26.1M to date, running 20% above The Dark Knight Rises at the same point in time. Australia is at $19.1M through Wednesday, which is 16% above Inception, having already surpassed the lifetimes of Dunkirk, Interstellar and Tenet. And, India is now at $16.7M.\n\nOther notable cumes include Mexico’s $15.4M, the 2nd biggest Nolan film in the market (having passed The Dark Knight this week); Spain’s $15M, Netherlands’ $12.7M; Brazil’s $10.2M, the 2nd biggest Nolan film ever, behind The Dark Knight Rises and performing 12% above that film at the same point; and Sweden with $6.5M, the 2nd biggest Nolan film in the market (behind The Dark Knight Rises).\n\nPREVIOUS, August 5: Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer has reached the $500M global milestone, on its way to an estimated $551M through Sunday. This would make it the filmmaker’s fifth-highest-grossing film of all time, ahead of Dunkirk. The worldwide total through Friday is $499.3M, meaning that it has already topped the five-century mark today.\n\nOverseas, the Universal title is expected to see an impressive 33% drop in the third frame, adding $51M and reaching an estimated international box office cume through Sunday of $323M, which is 129% above Dunkirk, 169% above Interstellar, 212% above Tenet, and 25% above The Dark Knight Rises at the same point in like-for-like markets.\n\nThe Cillian Murphy-starrer is the biggest Nolan film of all-time in 41 markets including the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, India, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. It is Nolan’s top non-Batman pic in 55, including Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Austria, Poland and Malaysia.\n\nThe epic story of the titular complicated and brilliant physicist tasked with leading the Manhattan Project, the secret effort to create the atom bomb, and the moral and political struggles that followed is now one of four biographical films to cross $500M global box office ever, including Bohemian Rhapsody, The Passion of the Christ and American Sniper.\n\nThrough Sunday, Oppenheimer will rank as the highest-grossing WWII movie of all time worldwide in reported historic grosses, ie also ahead of Saving Private Ryan ($482M) and Pearl Harbor ($449M).\n\nThe Top 5 markets through Friday are the UK/Ireland with $45M followed by Germany with $24.6M, France ($21.8M), Australia ($16M) and India ($15M).\n\nStill yet to release such major offshore markets as Korea, Italy and China."

        "text": "Emily Blunt told People magazine that starring in Christopher Nolan‘s “Oppenheimer” was like “summer camp” because the film’s ensemble cast lived together in New Mexico during production. However, it appears that leading man Cillian Murphy sat out most group activities.\n\n“We were all in the same hotel in the middle of the New Mexican desert,” Blunt said. “We only had each other. Me and Matt [Damon] were roommates and we were like, ‘Let’s go to have dinner.'”\n\nMurphy did not attend because “the sheer volume of what he had to take on and shoulder is so monumental,” Blunt added.\n\n“Of course he didn’t want to come and have dinner with us,” Damon said. “He couldn’t. His brain was just too full.”\n\nFor Murphy, “Oppenheimer” marks the biggest leading role of his film career thus far. That kind of pressure isolated the actor. “You know that when you have those big roles, that responsibility, you feel it’s kind of overwhelming,” he told People.\n\nNolan and Murphy’s working relationship spans nearly 20 years and counting as the filmmaker has directed the actor in six movies: Three Batman films, “Inception,” “Dunkirk” and “Oppenheimer.” Notably, the upcoming atomic bomb drama marks Murphy’s first time headlining a Nolan picture in the lead role. Murphy, who stars as theoretical physicist and “father of the atomic bomb” J. Robert Oppenheimer, told the Associated Press earlier this year that he “was desperate” to lead a Nolan movie.\n\n“I have always said publicly and privately, to Chris, that if I’m available and you want me to be in a movie, I’m there. I don’t really care about the size of the part,” Murphy said. “But deep down, secretly, I was desperate to play a lead for him.”\n\nMurphy landed the lead role in “Oppenheimer” via a cold-call offer from Nolan.\n\n“He’s so understated and self-deprecating and, in his very English manner, just said, ‘Listen, I’ve written this script, it’s about Oppenheimer. I’d like you to be my Oppenheimer,’” Murphy said. “It was a great day… We have this long-standing understanding and trust and shorthand and respect. It felt like the right time to take on a bigger responsibility. And it just so happened that it was a huge one.”\n\nThe all-star cast includes Blunt as Katherine “Kitty” Oppenheimer, Damon as Manhattan Project director Gen. Leslie Groves Jr. and Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss, a founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. Florence Pugh, Benny Safdie, Michael Angarano, Josh Hartnett, Rami Malek, Dane DeHaan, Dylan Arnold, David Krumholtz, Alden Ehrenreich and Matthew Modine also star.\n\n“Oppenheimer” opens in theaters July 21 from Universal Pictures."

The thing was, I had no idea. There was no preamble or anything, I just got the call. So it was incredibly exciting, and daunting, and terrifying, all at the same time.\"\n\nThe actor also spoke about being part of the film's starry cast, which includes Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh, Rami Malek, Josh Hartnett, and Kenneth Branagh.\n\n\"Every day, you had these phenomenal actors, who are heroes of mine, coming in,\" he said. \"Every day, you were having to raise your game to work with these legends.

        "text": "After Ron DeSantis‘ presidential campaign shared a bizarre and wildly homophobic video that includes footage of Cillian Murphy‘s character in “Peaky Blinders,” the team behind the British crime drama has denounced the video, adding that the footage of the show was “obtained without permission or official license.”\n\nThe video, shared by DeSantis’ campaign on Twitter, slams rival 2024 presidential candidate Donald Trump for vowing to “protect our LGBTQ citizens.” The video also mocks Trump for standing up for Caitlyn Jenner’s right to choose her own bathroom and allowing transgender women to compete in his Miss Universe pageants. The edit, which was first shared by @ProudElephantUS and then reposted to DeSantis’ “Rapid Response” campaign account @DeSantisWarRoom, then pivots to a clip of outwardly queer rapper Tyler, the Creator yelling “Psych!” before boasting DeSantis’ various legislative attacks against LGBTQ people.\n\nOne frame, sandwiched between an image of a male bodybuilder and a clip of Christian Bale in “American Psycho,” shows the Republican Florida governor wearing sunglasses above the headline: “DeSantis Signs ‘Most Extreme Slate of Anti-Trans Laws in Modern History.'” Alongside other images of shirtless men and horrifying headlines, there are two clips of Murphy’s “Peaky Blinders” character, Tommy Shelby.\n\n“We do not support nor endorse the video’s narrative and strongly disapprove of the use of the content in this manner,” Murphy wrote in a joint statement with “Peaky Blinders” creator Steven Knight, Caryn Mandabach Productions, Tiger Aspect Productions and Banijay Rights.\n\nRepresentatives for DeSantis did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment.\n\nThis isn’t DeSantis’ first brush with Hollywood. Notably, the Republican presidential candidate has picked a legal battle with Disney by taking away the company’s power to self-govern the 25,000-acre site of its Orlando amusement parks. In an earnings call in May, Disney CEO Bob Iger called DeSantis’ actions a “matter of retaliation” against the entertainment conglomerate for its stance against the Florida governor’s controversial “Don’t Say Gay” bill in 2022."

Following the nearly three-hour screening, critics are praising Cillian Murphy‘s performance and calling the film “awe-inspiring,” “staggering” and a “spectacular achievement.”\n\nTotal Film editor Matt Maytum said the film left him “stunned” and called Cillian Murphy’s performance “sublime.” “An epic historical drama but with a distinctly Nolan sensibility: the tension, structure, sense of scale, startling sound design, remarkable visuals. Wow,” he added.\n\n#Oppenheimer left me stunned: a character study on the grandest scale, with a sublime central performance by Cillian Murphy. An epic historical drama but with a distinctly Nolan sensibility: the tension, structure, sense of scale, startling sound design, remarkable visuals. Wow — Matt Maytum (@mattmaytum) July 11, 2023\n\nJonathan Dean of The Sunday Times says he was “totally absorbed” by the film calling it “a dense, talkie, tense film partly about the bomb, mostly about how doomed we are.”\n\n“Murphy is good, but the support essential: Damon, Downey Jr & Ehrenreich even bring gags. An audacious, inventive, complex film to rattle its audience,” Dean added.\n\nOne negative point Dean mentioned was that the women in the cast “are badly served” noting “Emily Blunt only once gets out of her stressed mother role.” However, Dean has already ranked Oppenheimer in his top three Nolan films alongside Memento and The Prestige.\n\nThe downside? The women are badly served – Emily Blunt only once gets out of her stressed mother role. But it’s straight into my Nolan top three, alongside Memento & The Prestige — Jonathan Dean (@JonathanDean_) July 11, 2023\n\nBilge Ebiri of Vulture tweeted, “OPPENHEIMER is…incredible. The word that keeps coming to mind is ‘fearsome.’ A relentlessly paced, insanely detailed, intricate historical drama that builds and builds and builds until Nolan brings the hammer down in the most astonishing, shattering way.”\n\nOPPENHEIMER is…incredible.

And the big moment – THAT MOMENT – is awe-inspiring.”\n\nIt’s hard to talk about something as dense as this in something as silly as a tweet or thread but Oppenheimer really is a serious, philosophical, adult drama that’s as tense and exciting as Dunkirk. And the big moment – THAT MOMENT – is awe inspiring. — Lindsey Bahr (@ldbahr) July 11, 2023\n\nCollider’s editor-in-chief Steven Weintraub said the film “is incredible” adding, “Every aspect of the film is worth talking about from the brilliant performances, to #HoytevanHoytema’s amazing work behind the camera, to the way Nolan tells the story. The 3-hour run time flies by. See it in @IMAX 70mm if you can.”\n\n#ChristopherNolan's #Oppenheimer is incredible.

Me and Matt were roommates and we were like, 'Let's go to have dinner.' \"\n\nSadly for Murphy, he rarely got to join in on the fun due to the daunting task of leading Nolan's film.\n\n\"The sheer volume of what he had to take on and shoulder is so monumental,\" marvels Blunt. \"Of course he didn't want to come and have dinner with us.\" Damon agrees, saying, \"He couldn't. His brain was just too full.\"\n\nAdds Murphy, \"You know that when you have those big roles, that responsibility, you feel it's kind of overwhelming.\"\n\nOppenheimer will hit theaters on July 21.

        "text": "While Hollywood braces for an actors strike, the key cast of Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” — Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. and Matt Damon — walked the red carpet at the Paris world premiere on Tuesday, but didn’t talk politics.\n\nNolan, receiving rapturous applause as he walked into the theater, spoke onstage about his special bond with France and the 90-year old Grand Rex Theater, dating back to his 2000 film “Memento.”\n\n“When we made our first film ‘Memento,’ no one in the world would show this film,” Nolan said, until the Grand Rex Theater booked it. “Looking at the size of it I have no idea why, but people came and our lives changed and we love this theater,” added Nolan, who was surrounded by his cast and producers, including his wife Emma Thomas.\n\nAs the three-hour historical epic was about to begin, Nolan warned the audience that “it’s an intense experience, it’s a serious subject, but it’s something we pulled our hearts into.” The movie delves into the creation of the atomic bomb during World War II.\n\nDowney Jr., who made a showy entrance on the red carpet, looking as sleek and stylish as Tony Stark, said “Oppenheimer” stands out from the other movies he starred in.\n\n“I’ve done a lot of movies where it kind of becomes about aliens and bad guys and action and flying around. But this is a blockbuster about our history as human beings. And it’s just amazing how he pulled it off,” said Downey Jr. who owes his huge popularity in France to his turn in “Iron Man” and “The Avengers.” He said “Oppenheimer” is a “blockbuster movie that is about something so intimate and so important.”\n\nSpeaking of having the movie world premiere in France, Downey Jr. said it was “an appropriate place” because the “French really love and have contributed to so much to great cinema.”\n\nRobert Downey Jr arrives on the red carpet for the world premiere of #Oppenheimer in Paris! Stylish as ever. French fans are getting excited. pic.twitter.com/e9ULtpiyjq — Elsa Keslassy (@ElsaKeslassy) July 11, 2023\n\nThe atmosphere was solemn if not tense at the premiere event, possibly due to the looming actors strike. The unbearable heat didn’t help either. Murphy, who plays the title role as the American theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, kept a low profile on the red carpet. Blunt, who looked stunning in a silk gown, said it was an “extraordinary set, fully immersive, which is what Chris adores to do, so you feel kidnapped by the experience as an actor.”\n\nBlunt, who plays Oppenheimer’s wife, Katherine Oppenheimer, said “no details were spared and it was just transporting for all of us to be a part of it.” The British actor said she and Murphy, who starred together in “A Quiet Place Part II,” “had already bonded and we were pals,” and that the actors developed a “secret language.” Blunt added of Murphy, “I adore working with him. I would do anything with him. He’s the greatest.”\n\nDamon, who spent nearly 40 minutes with fans signing autographs and posing for selfies, said he was in Paris with his three daughters and looked forward to seeing “how the audience responds to this very special movie.”\n\nGuests inside the Rex Theater were treated with champagne cups, but the concession stands were closed for the occasion, meaning no food was available on site.\n\nUniversal is releasing the $100 million-budgeted “Oppenheimer” in theaters on July 21."

I didn’t know that – I would be there in a flash,” Murphy said.\n\n“I made two movies with both of those guys, and I would love to work with them again. Of course, I’m there.”\n\n28 Days Later co-starred Brendan Gleeson and Christopher Eccleston. It grossed $84.6m (£64.2m) from a budget of just $8m (£6.1m). Murphy worked with both Boyle and Garland on the 2007 film Sunshine.\n\nCillian Murphy in ‘28 Days Later' (Peter Mountain/Dna/20th Century Fox/Kobal/Shutterstock)\n\nThe film launched Murphy’s career, and just five years later, he collaborated with Nolan for the first time in Batman Begins. Oppenheimer marks his sixth time working with the filmmaker – but this time, he takes on the lead role, playing Robert J Oppenheimer, the man who created the atomic bomb.\n\nOppenheimer co-stars Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh. It’s released in cinemas on 21 July.\n\nThe Independent’s full interview with Murphy and Nolan will be published on Saturday (22 July)."

        "text": "1976-present\n\nWho Is Cillian Murphy?\n\nCillian Murphy is an Irish actor who began his career as a theater performer and transitioned into movies and television. He is best known for portraying gangster Thomas “Tommy” Shelby on the hit BBC and Netflix series Peaky Blinders, as well as parts in the films 28 Days Later, Batman Begins, and Dunkirk. A frequent collaborator with Christopher Nolan, Murphy plays the title role in the director’s 2023 biopic Oppenheimer about how American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer helped develop the first nuclear weapons.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nFULL NAME: Cillian Murphy\n\nBORN: May 25, 1976\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Douglas, Cork, Ireland\n\nSPOUSE: Yvonne McGuinness (2004-present)\n\nCHILDREN: Malachy and Aran\n\nASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Gemini\n\n\n\nEarly Life and Education\n\nCillian Murphy was born on May 25, 1976, in Douglas near Cork, Ireland. The oldest of four siblings—including brother Paidi and sisters Sile and Orla—Murphy was raised Catholic in a family of academics. His father, Brendan Murphy, was a school inspector, then a civil servant at the Irish Department of Education. His mother, whose name has not been shared publicly, was a French teacher, and his aunts, uncles, and grandfather were all teachers as well.\n\nMurphy attended Presentation Brothers College, a private Catholic secondary school in Cork, where he succeeded academically and discovered he was drawn to the arts. “I was always fascinated by the idea of artists: authors, playwrights, musicians. Those things seemed alien and otherworldly at the time,” Murphy said to The Guardian. “At a rugby[-playing], academic school, you felt a little bit foolish thinking you could ever enter into that artistic world.”\n\nMurphy, who plays guitar and originally aspired to be a musician, started a jazz-rock band with his friends called Sons of Mr. Green Genes. They were eventually offered a record contract but declined, and Murphy decided to pursue acting.\n\nInspired by a performance of A Clockwork Orange he attended at a nightclub, Murphy became serious about drama while studying law at University College Cork in 1996. A law career wasn’t in the cards—Murphy failed his law exams—but the transition to the stage would prove to be pivotal for Murphy’s future.\n\nTheater Career and Early Film Roles\n\nIn the summer of 1996, 20-year-old Murphy auditioned for and earned one of the lead roles in Disco Pigs, a work by then-unknown playwright Enda Walsh. The play was booked at the Triskel Arts Centre in Cork for a few weeks but became a big hit and sparked an 18-month world tour through Europe, Australia, and North America.\n\nWhen Murphy received the script, it was the first time he had read a play outside of school productions. “That’s how theater illiterate I was,” Murphy told The Irish Times. Still, he excelled in his role as Pig, and the play was adapted into a 2001 film also starring Murphy.\n\nMurphy began to receive minor film roles following the success of Disco Pigs, including in 1998’s Sweety Barrett, which starred his friend Brendan Gleeson, and 1999’s The Trench, which featured rising talent Daniel Craig.\n\nAlthough his film career took off over the following years, Murphy has continued to act on stage with his most recent role in 2019. He appeared in plays such as The Shape of Things, The Seagull, Love Song, and again collaborated with Walsh for Misterman, Ballyturk, and Grief Is the Thing With Feathers.\n\nMovie Breakout With '28 Days Later'\n\nCillian Murphy’s character Jim walks through an empty London during a scene in the 2002 horror film 28 Days Later. Getty Images\n\nMurphy began to receive widespread recognition with his starring role in the 2002 horror film 28 Days Later, directed by Danny Boyle. In the movie, Murphy plays a bike courier named Jim who awakens from a coma four weeks after a viral outbreak has decimated Great Britain. The film is considered a horror benchmark for utilizing the concept of “fast zombies,” which can run after prey with increased strength, and sparked a renewed interest in zombie media altogether.\n\nIn a 2022 interview, Murphy detailed his audition process and said he initially struggled with the character’s London accent. But with the support of Boyle—who discovered Murphy when watching the film adaptation of Disco Pigs—he eventually “kind of unlocked something” with his performance.\n\nMurphy said the film was “massive” for his career, opening doors to other projects and leading to his relationship with Christopher Nolan. The following year in 2003, he had a lead role in Intermission and supporting parts in Girl with a Pearl Earring—which starred a 19-year-old Scarlett Johansson—and the war epic Cold Mountain.\n\nCritics also praised Murphy for his performance as antagonist Jackson Rippner in the 2005 thriller Red Eye, with The New York Times’ Manohla Dargis writing the actor made “enough of a picture-perfect villain here that his agent should be worried about typecasting.”\n\n\n\nChristopher Nolan Movies: Batman Trilogy, 'Oppenheimer,' and More\n\nDirector Christopher Nolan worked with Cillian Murphy on five other films before casting him as the lead in Oppenheimer. Getty Images\n\nWith the 2023 release of Oppenheimer, Murphy has now appeared in six of Christopher Nolan’s films. The first was Batman Begins—the beginning of the acclaimed Dark Knight trilogy—in 2005.\n\nMurphy had been a fan of Nolan’s earlier films, including Following and Memento, and told GQ he was one of about 10 actors that auditioned for the role of Bruce Wayne and his iconic alter ego. Nolan said in a later interview that although it was apparent Murphy wasn’t a good fit as the caped crusader, “I felt like, this is somebody I want to work with, somebody who has an interesting take on things creatively.” So, the director let a batsuit-clad Murphy do a screen test for the character anyway and made sure executives from Warner Bros. were there to watch. Nolan saw potential in the relatively unknown Murphy and instead offered him the part of Dr. Jonathan Crane and his nefarious alter ego Scarecrow. Murphy also appeared as the character in the trilogy’s next two films: The Dark Knight in 2008 and The Dark Knight Rises in 2012.\n\nElsewhere, Murphy played Robert Fischer in Nolan’s 2010 sci-fi film Inception and a World War II soldier in his 2017 thriller Dunkirk.\n\nAs for casting Murphy in the lead role of Oppenheimer, Nolan called it “honestly one of my favorite moments in the movie business.” Murphy underwent five months of preparation before the shoot, losing weight to better fit the scientist’s silhouette and practicing his facial expressions. For Murphy, it was a dream part. “I’d always show up for Chris, even if it was walking in the background of his next movie with a surfboard,” Murphy told The Hollywood Reporter. “Though… not sure what kind of Chris Nolan movie that would be. But I always hoped I could play a lead in a Chris Nolan movie. What actor wouldn’t want to do that?”\n\nMurphy’s Other Movies\n\nIn addition to Nolan’s big-budget blockbusters, Murphy has frequently appeared in lesser-known films showcasing his versatility as an actor. He received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in the 2005 film Breakfast on Pluto, in which he played a transgender woman searching for her mother in 1970s London after being abandoned at birth. A year later, he played a soldier in the Irish Republican Army in the 2006 war film The Wind That Shakes the Barley. The film received the Palme d’Or, the highest award at the annual Cannes Film Festival.\n\nIn 2007, Murphy teamed again with director Danny Boyle for the sci-fi movie Sunshine, in which astronauts are sent on a mission to reignite the sun in the year 2057. Other movies featuring Murphy include Peacock (2010), Aloft (2014), Transcendence (2014), The Party (2017), and Anna (2019).\n\nPrior to Oppenheimer, Murphy’s highest-profile film in recent years had been A Quiet Place Part II, the 2020 sequel to the horror hit starring Emily Blunt and John Krasinski.\n\nLead Role in 'Peaky Blinders'\n\nCillian Murphy played Tommy Shelby in Peaky Blinders for six seasons. Robert Viglasky // Netflix\n\nMurphy, who is only just over 5 feet, 7 inches tall, garnered widespread acclaim for his performance as the sometimes larger-than-life gang leader Tommy Shelby in the BBC and Netflix series Peaky Blinders. The drama, which tells the story of a fictionalized crime gang in Birmingham, England, following World War I, ran for six seasons from 2013 through 2022 and featured an ensemble cast including Tom Hardy, Adrien Brody, and Anya Taylor-Joy.\n\nShow creator Steven Knight described Murphy as the antithesis of the often violent and morally questionable Shelby. He initially eyed action star Jason Statham for the role but was reassured of Murphy’s fit for the part by a text message Murphy sent him after auditioning: “Remember, I’m an actor.”\n\nMurphy has described Shelby as a “gift of a character” but exhausting to play. He told The Guardian in 2016 the show required 16-hour days, with the actors working through pages of dialogue. While filming in Liverpool, England, Murphy lived what he called a “canceled life. You go home to your tiny apartment at the end of the day, and you feed yourself for sustenance, and you learn your lines for the next day, and you try to get as much sleep as you possibly can.”\n\nHis dedication paid off. Murphy won for best drama performance at the National Television Awards and was nominated for a BAFTA TV Award for leading actor following the show’s final season.\n\nWife and Children\n\nAs his theater career was taking off in the summer of 1996, Murphy met Yvonne McGuinness, a classically trained visual artist from Kilkenny, Ireland. Murphy had been recently cast in the stage production of Disco Pigs, and their relationship blossomed as McGuinness accompanied him for much of the show’s tour. The couple has been married since 2004 and has two sons: Malachy, born in 2005, and Aran, born in 2007.\n\nMurphy isn’t on social media and rarely talks about his family in interviews, as he and McGuinness prefer to live out of the spotlight. The actor credited McGuinness for keeping him grounded as his fame grew in the early and mid-2000s, telling People: “It’s very important to have somebody like that. My life hasn’t changed in any way, really. I still have the same friends, and we go to the same places.”\n\nIn 2015, the family moved from London to Dublin so Malachy and Aran could be closer to their grandparents. McGuinness stayed with their sons in Dublin when Murphy left to film Peaky Blinders in Liverpool.\n\nQuotes\n\nThe fame thing was never a goal. I just want to improve. If I can leave one film behind that’s something that affects everybody, that’s absolutely fine.\n\nI think there’s such a thing as a performance gene. If it’s in your DNA, it needs to come out. For me, it originally came out through music, then segued into acting and came out through there. I always needed to get up and perform.\n\nI’ve never equated success with employment. To me, success is the quality of the work, and I’m patient enough to wait for the next reasonably good script to arrive, because they’re so rare.\n\nIt’s only an advantage as an actor looking younger than you are. If you can maintain it.\n\nFor me, always trusting your instincts is really, really important. Making decisions based on the work and never your career or never making decisions based on strategy. And always following the artists and not the industry.\n\nI’m s­— at being anything else other than an actor. I’m s— at being a personality. I’m s— at red carpets. I’m s— at being on talk shows. I’m s— at, like, all the other stuff that comes with it.\n\nFact Check: We strive for accuracy and fairness. If you see something that doesn’t look right, contact us!\n\n.."

What he meant by the text was that when he walks into a room, he’s not Tommy Shelby. But he can become him. He inhabits that role completely. It’s phenomenal. It is impossible to imagine anybody else playing him.\"\n\nMurphy's next role comes in the form of Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer where Murphy will taker on the lead role as physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer - the man who invented the atomic bomb."

        "text": "SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher (C) attends a press conference announcing the beginning of a strike, at the guild headquarters in Los Angeles, California, US. Photograph: EPA\n\nThe union representing Hollywood actors formally announced a strike on Thursday, expanding the standoff between Hollywood workers and studio executives over wages, AI technology and how to divide the profits of the new digital streaming era.\n\nThe strike by the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (Sag-Aftra) marks the first time in 63 years Hollywood writers and actors are striking simultaneously.\n\nHollywood writers went on strike in early May. Now the 11,500 members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) will be joined by some of Sag-Aftra’s 160,000 members.\n\n“At some point you have to say no: we are not going to take this any more,” Fran Drescher, the Sag-Aftra president, said in a press conference. “You cannot change the business model as much as it has changed and not change the contract too.”\n\nREAD MORE\n\n“If we don’t stand tall right now, we are all in trouble,” she said.\n\nA strike is expected to have an immediate impact on publicity efforts for the summer’s top films; the Thursday evening premiere of Oppenheimer in London was moved to start an hour earlier so the cast could attend regardless of the outcome. Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt and Matt Damon were among the stars who staged a walk-out from the premiere to “write their picket signs” ahead of the Sag-Aftra strike announcement on Thursday evening. Other major commercial films including Barbie and Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One have already hosted their world premieres, though their stars will be restricted from participating in further promotional events.\n\n[ Hollywood screenwriters strike: how will it affect what I can watch in Ireland? ]\n\nThe simultaneous strikes are expected to halt the majority of Hollywood’s film and TV production, and have major effects on the broader Los Angeles economy. With some of Hollywood’s biggest stars on strike, press junkets for summer and fall movie premieres will be cancelled, and the Emmy Awards will likely be postponed. Workers across LA are gearing up to survive for weeks or months without wages.\n\nHollywood actors will go on strike after talks with studios broke down, joining film and television writers who have been on picket lines since May.\n\nMembers of both Sag-Aftra and WGA voted overwhelmingly to authorise a strike if needed, a sign of their growing frustrations with what actors and writers have described as shrinking compensation for their work as film and TV shows have increasingly moved to online streaming platforms, and rising fears of how the industry might try to replace creative workers of all kinds with AI technologies.\n\nIn recent weeks, Hollywood’s top acting talent had made it clear they were willing to strike. In late June, a letter from Hollywood A-listers, including Meryl Streep and Jennifer Lawrence, urged their union leaders not to settle for a mediocre deal in what they saw as a historically important contract negotiation.\n\nSag-Aftra and the studios had been negotiating for weeks, but failed to reach an agreement by the deadline of midnight on Wednesday. In a statement on Thursday, the actors’ union said its negotiating committee had voted unanimously to recommend a strike, and that its national board would decide on the matter on Thursday morning.\n\nStriking Writers Guild of America workers picket outside Paramount Studios in Los Angeles, California. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty\n\nIt said: “After more than four weeks of bargaining, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) – the entity that represents major studios and streamers, including Amazon, Apple, Disney, NBCUniversal, Netflix, Paramount, Sony and Warner Bros Discovery – remains unwilling to offer a fair deal on the key issues that are essential to Sag-Aftra members.”\n\nThe Sag-Aftra president, Fran Drescher, said: “The companies have refused to meaningfully engage on some topics and on others completely stonewalled us. Until they do negotiate in good faith, we cannot begin to reach a deal. We have no choice but to move forward in unity, and on behalf of our membership, with a strike recommendation to our national board. The board will discuss the issue this morning and will make its decision.”\n\nThe strike might also delay the Emmy awards until late autumn, or even next year, industry publications reported. Disney has announced that a July 15th premiere of its movie Haunted Mansion will still take place at Disneyland regardless of the strikes, though the film’s actors – including LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish and Jamie Lee Curtis – will not be present. San Diego Comic-Con, scheduled to begin on July 20th, will be affected as well.\n\n[ Hollywood writers’ strike is at once heartening and depressing ]\n\nHollywood writers have been on strike since May 2nd. The beginning of that strike was marked by strong solidarity from Hollywood’s other unionised workforces, including the powerful Teamsters’ union, and Sag-Aftra members showed up in solidarity at Writers Guild of America picket lines, even before their own strike was called.\n\nAnonymous industry sources told Deadline this week that studio executives did not plan to resume negotiations with the striking writers until late October.\n\n“The endgame is to allow things to drag on until union members start losing their apartments and losing their houses,” an industry source was quoted as saying, with another saying the goal was to “break the WGA”. A spokesperson for the studios denied those anonymous claims, telling Deadline in a statement that the companies “are committed to reaching a deal”. – Guardian/PA"

An R-rated film may include adult themes, adult activity, aggressive language, intense or persistent violence, sexually oriented nudity, drug abuse or other elements, so parents are advised to take this criterion very seriously. Children under the age of 17 are not permitted to attend R-rated films alone without a parent or adult guardian. Parents are urged to learn more about R-rated movies to determine their suitability for their children. It is generally not appropriate for parents to take their children with them to R-rated movies,\" states this film warning."

Pic: The Blindboy Podcast\n\nBlindboy revealed that the Cork actor was set to appear on this week’s episode of the podcast, saying ‘I was going to have Cillian Murphy on the podcast to speak about his new film Oppenheimer. We were all excited to do it, couldn’t wait… it was going to be a big exclusive proper chat with Cillian Murphy, who I’ve had on this podcast before.\n\n‘But the Screen Actors Guild have gone on strike for the first time in 50 years I believe, that means Cillian Murphy is on strike as well. Cillian Murphy doesn’t cross picket lines obviously, and I don’t cross picket lines, so unfortunately he is not my guest in this week’s podcast.’\n\nWhile Blindboy’s podcast episodes usually begin with a poem read by an ‘actor’ such as Colin Farrell or Timothee Chalamet, but Blindboy assured that Cillian was definitely going to be on the podcast.\n\nCillian was set to appear on Blindboy’s podcast this week — but as a result of the SAG strike cannot cross the picket line. Pic: David Fisher/Shutterstock\n\n‘I know each week I often start off the podcast with a poem from a Hollywood actor, so it sounds a little boy who cried wolf, but no Cillian Murphy was literally going to be on the podcast this week, and we were going to chat about Oppenheimer.’\n\nThe strike began when Cillian and the cast of Oppenheimer — which depicts the life of J Robert Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project, which saw the development of the atomic bomb — were at the premiere of the film in London, leaving before the film began to join the picket.\n\nSpeaking on the red carpet, Cillian’s co-star Kenneth Branagh told the PA news agency ‘Everybody is working very hard to make sure it doesn’t happen, if it happens I stand in solidarity with our Sag members.\n\nThe SAG strike began when the Oppenheimer London premiere was taking place, with the film’s stars walking out of the premiere before the film began screening. Pic: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images\n\n‘We know it is a critical time at this point in the industry and the issues need to be addressed, difficult conversations, I know everybody is trying to get a fair deal, that is what’s required so we’ll support that.’\n\nMurphy told PA ‘I stand by my colleagues, that’s all I can say to you.’\n\nSpeaking on stage at the premiere ahead of the strike announcement, director Christopher Nolan said ‘I have to acknowledge the work of our incredible cast, led by Cillian Murphy. The list is enormous — Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh, Rami Malek and so many more. You’ve seen them here earlier on the red carpet.\n\n‘Unfortunately, they are off to write their picket signs for what we believe to be an imminent strike by SAG, joining one of my guilds, the Writers Guild, in the struggle for fair wages for working members of their union.’"

        "text": "Cillian Murphy has become death, destroyer of worlds. Or, at least, he has become J. Robert Oppenheimer, creator of the atomic bomb and the man behind that famous quote. Oppenheimer, the latest film from director Christopher Nolan, opens in theaters on July 21, and it gives Murphy his biggest role yet. The 47-year-old Irish actor has been a regular in the movies and, to a lesser extent, on TV screens for more than two decades before Oppenheimer, the historical war drama about the invention and building of the atomic bombs that were used to end World War II — and give humanity the power to destroy itself.\n\nRELATED: Oppenheimer Star Cillian Murphy Says Playing Father of Atomic Bomb Both 'Terrifying and Exciting'\n\nBefore Oppenheimer premieres, let’s look back at some of Murphy’s previous roles, including a member of Batman’s rogues' gallery, a scientist on a mission to the sun, and a survivor of multiple apocalypses.\n\n28 Days Later (2002)\n\nMurphy’s breakout role came in 2002 when he starred in 28 Days Later, Danny Boyle’s terrifying reinvention of the zombie genre. The story, which was written by future Ex Machina director Alex Garland, has Murphy’s character, Jim, wake up from a coma after 28 days — only to discover that a highly infectious virus known as Rage has transformed most of Great Britain into mindless, hyper-aggressive, zombie-like beings.\n\nIt’s an incredible early showcase for Murphy, who has an innate haunting beauty about him that lends itself well to walking around an eerily empty London before chaos breaks out.\n\nThe Dark Knight Trilogy (2002-2012)\n\nMurphy actually auditioned to play Batman in Batman Begins, and while Nolan decided he wasn’t right to play the Caped Crusader (Christian Bale got the role), he felt an instant connection with Murphy, and cast him as Dr. Jonathan Crane, aka The Scarecrow. He’s Batman Begins' secondary villain after Ra's al Ghul, but his fear-obsessed baddie might be the better foe.\n\n(Who can forget how Murphy says “the bat-man?”)\n\nMurphy would return as the Scarecrow in the next two Batman movies in cameo roles, both of which are delightful.\n\nRed Eye (2005)\n\nThe same year he played a supervillain, Murphy was also playing a baddie in Red Eye, a psychological thriller from Scream creator Wes Craven. Murphy plays the subtly-named assassin Jackson Rippner, who becomes a terrifying threat to a young woman (played by Rachel McAdams) when they’re seated next to each other on a red-eye flight. It’s a great showcase of Murphy’s talents, as he’s got an undeniable magnetism and charisma even as he’s scaring his fellow actors and the audience alike.\n\nThe Wind the Shakes the Barley (2006)\n\nWorld War II is not Murphy’s first on-screen war. He starred in this 2006 war drama about the Irish War of Independence and the subsequent Irish Civil War in the early 1920s. The film won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, and Murphy’s nuanced performance is no small part of that.\n\nSunshine (2006)\n\nThanks to Sunshine, the atomic bomb is not the biggest bomb Murphy has ever created on the big screen. In this haunting sci-fi flick (another Boyle and Garland collaboration), Murphy plays a scientist on the fatefully named Icarus II, a spaceship that will travel to the sun and detonate an unfathomably massive bomb Murphy’s character designed in order to restart it. It’s cerebral, beautiful — and horrifying.\n\nInception (2010)\n\nAnother Nolan collaboration, Inception casts Murphy as the heir to a business empire and the target of Leonardo DiCaprio’s reverse-heist dream invasion. Murphy gives the character the right amount of pathos, and even as you’re hoping DiCaprio’s plan works and they successfully incept him, you’re also yearning for Murphy’s own catharsis, which the film ultimately provides.\n\nDunkirk (2017)\n\nOnce more, Murphy co-starred in a Nolan movie, and once more he played a man who is haunted by horrors unknown to most. (Murphy knows his strengths as an actor!) Murphy plays a consequential but unnamed soldier who is attempting, like so many others, to retreat across the English Channel and escape to fight Nazis another day.\n\nRELATED: Christopher Nolan Teases “Interesting Relationship” Between Endings of Inception and Oppenheimer\n\nDue to the film’s multiple timelines, we see two versions of Murphy’s character. At the start, he’s brash, and a bit of a jerk. But, when he ends up in the water and pulled into a civilian rescuer’s boat, Murphy fully sells just how shaken and damaged he’s become in just a few hours — to tragic ends.\n\nA Quiet Place Part II (2020)\n\nIn a throwback to his early days as a post-apocalyptic survivor, Murphy appears in the A Quiet Place sequel, though now he’s surviving aliens rather than zombies. As is his seeming trademark, Murphy is yet again a psychologically haunted man, as when we first meet him he’s largely given up hope because his family died earlier in the alien invasion.\n\nWere it another actor but Murphy, playing tortured characters might get old after a while. But, he’s just so good at it that it only makes sense to saddle him with the weight of the creation of the atomic bomb.\n\nOppenheimer opens exclusively in theaters on July 21."

It must be good\"\n\nWhile speculation of movie secrets and five of Hollywood's biggest hitters would be enough to cause anyone's Instagram to explode like an atom bomb, many people are more interested in the fact that Peaky Blinder's star Murphy is actually smiling.\n\nFans were probably relieved to see the usually reserved actor looking rather relaxed as recently spoke of the enormous pressure he felt taking on the his recent role.\n\nSpeaking to People about this significant undertaking Murphy stated: “You know that when you have those big roles, that responsibility, you feel it’s kind of overwhelming.”\n\nA weight certainly seems to have been lifted since wrapping production for Murphy and followers were keen to comment.\n\n\"Cillian wasn't just smiling, he's wide smiling. This doesn't feel right,\" one joked, while another also added: \"No way you got Cillian to pose like that.\"\n\nA third also wrote: \"Cillian can smile like that? It's Barbie effect y'all,\" while one follower gushed: \"What a dream it could be to be in this photo.\"\n\nThat final comment is a reference to now popular idea that people should make a double feature of the two most anticipated theatrical releases of the summer.\n\nNolan's film shares a release date with Greta Gerwig's Barbie, starring Aussie actress Margot Robbie.\n\nMany a meme has circulated online, with cinema-goers sharing their eagerness to see the two equally hyped yet polar opposite movies.\n\nThis odd pairing has become to be know as doing the \"Barbenheimer\"\n\nPlaying into the fun, Greta Gerwig and Robbie posed with their tickets to see Oppenheimer and Murphy responded in kind by encouraging people to see both releases on the same day.\n\nBoth Barbie and Oppenheimer hit cinemas 21st July"

Greta Gerwig 's 'Barbie' starring Margot Robbie and Christopher Nolan 's ' Oppenheimer ' starring Cillian Murphy will bring the fan frenzy to theatres this Friday, making way for one epic box office battle.With regard to the hype and appeal for the new films, studios have released their predictions for the box office collections.Going by the early estimates, it seems that Barbie will top the opening weekend numbers keeping the 'A' rated Oppenheimer in second place.Barbie, led by Margot, is expected to bring in an estimated $95 million to $110 million from 4,200 North American theatres, stated a Variety report. Warner Bros. is projecting a more conservative $75 million to start, while rivals and exhibitors say it fetch an impressive $140 million weekend at the US box office. These numbers come in as a welcomed sign, considering that the movie cost an estimated $145 million to make.Meanwhile, Nolan’s Oppenheimer is predicted to earn a little less on its opening weekend, bringing in an estimated $50 million from 3,600 cinemas. Universal’s historical biopic cost an estimated $100 million to make.While buzz around both movies is great, cinema halls are bracing themselves to be hit by a pink tsunami as 'Barbie' opens with a vast marketing campaign.Not even an actors' and writers' strike has been able to put brakes on the juggernaut, with Margot as Barbie, andRyan Gosling as her square-jawed boyfriend Ken, sending social media into a frenzy of fuchsia. With the movie hitting big screens across Europe on Wednesday, and North America on Friday, expectation is building at how director and indie film darling Greta Gerwig has tackled the subject of the doll who set unrealistic body standards for women."

        "text": "Robert Downey Jr gushes over Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer performance\n\nThe Marvel superstar hailed Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer as \"exceptional\".\n\nAnticipation is building ahead of the release of Christopher Nolan's latest blockbuster Oppenheimer, in which Irish acting sensation Cillian Murphy undertakes the lead role of the infamous nuclear scientist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNolan himself has recently claimed that viewers will leave theatres \"devastated\" and unable to speak upon seeing the film, with Marvel superstar Robert Downey Jr's latest comments only further fuelling the sense of expectancy from audiences.\n\nAppearing on the Armchair Expert podcast, Downey discussed his role in the film, and went out of his way to lavish praise upon Cork native Murphy.\n\nHost and fellow actor Dax Shepard opened the discussion on Murphy, recounting his own interactions with the Peaky Blinders lead;\n\n\"Cillian, we interviewed him, we love him, what a great guy!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis prompted Downey to delve into his experience with Murphy on set, and recall how observing the Irishman left him in a sense of awe.\n\n\"He is so beyond exceptional\", exclaimed Downey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"What's really trippy is that there used to be a show on TV called 'Man, Moment, Machine' about when the right individual at a point in history came up with the right discovery, and I could say the same thing about Cillian Murphy\".\n\nDiscussing the unique connection evident between the storied director and Murphy, Downey said that;\n\n\"He is perfectly disposed to have the relationship with Chris Nolan, to have this opportunity come up, and to have the wherewithal, the gift and the intestinal fortitude to survive making it\".\n\n\"We've been on some tough projects, but I have never seen anybody have a bigger lift in the history of my career than Cillian Murphy playing Oppenheimer\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, as if we didn't have reason enough to see the historical thriller, this high praise from one of Hollywood's biggest names has only increased our want to see what sort of cinematic masterpiece Christopher Nolan has conjured for viewers this time around.\n\nThe movie is set to release in Ireland in just under a months time, on July 21st, setting up a box office battle with Barbie which comes out on the same date.\n\nRelated Articles:"

        "text": "\"Cinema is thriving this summer,\" wrote a fan as photos of Margot Robbie and director Greta Gerwig posing with their movie tickets for 'Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning, Part One,' ' Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' and ' Oppenheimer .'In just a few days, fans will be left spoilt for choice as theatres get ready for one big showdown. Come July 12, the highly anticipated Tom Cruise film 'Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning, Part One' will arrive on the big screens.A week later, the film will clash with Margot's ' Barbie ' movie that also stars a host of actors, including Ryan Gosling in the lead.Interestingly, the colourful Gerta Gerwig directorial will clash head-on at the ticket windows with Christopher Nolan 's period drama 'Oppenheimer', based on the true story of the man who invented the atomic bomb.With the films ready to clash at the box office, it seems like there is no bad blood between the lead stars as they set out to the movie theatres with their directors to buy their tickets to the other's films.Cruise took the lead, giving his fellow Hollywood stars a 'Mission' to buy tickets to the four big summer blockbusters. \"This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theatres,\" the actor began in a tweet and went on to add, \"Congratulations, Harrison Ford , on 40 years of Indy and one of the most iconic characters in history.\"Cheering for his box office opponents, Cruise posted photos of himself posing with the ticket to the screenings of both Barbie and Oppenheimer. \"I love a double feature, and it doesn't get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Oppenheimer and Barbie,\" he tweeted.Shortly after, Margot and Greta also took to their handles to buy themselves four tickets to the summer blockbusters and captioned it as, \"Mission: Accepted!\"The photos of the celebs promoting each others' films got fans all hyped and excited to catch the upcoming films in theatres. \"We're loving this trend of stars & filmmakers supporting one another,\" wrote a fan.Another said, \"Seeing Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie with their tickets for #IndianaJones and the Dial of Destiny, #MissionImpossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1, and Oppenheimer is so awesome! We love movies! \"Another tweeted, \"Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie seated for Oppenheimer. supportive & I love it!\"The viral pictures prompted other another fan to ask Christopher Nolan to reciprocate the love in a tweet that read, \"I love that Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig are following after Tom Cruise’s footsteps as they actively promote movies that are in direct competition with #BARBIE! Your turn Christopher Nolan and Cillian Murphy !\"A fan quipped, \"Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie just forced Christopher Nolan to do the unthinkable.\"The cross-promotion will be a welcome boost to the box office as Hollywood tentpoles outside of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse had underwhelming releases this past year."

        "text": "The stage has been set yet again for remarkable physical transformations by Hollywood actors as Cillian Murphy, aged 47, impresses audiences with his transformation for the upcoming blockbuster, Oppenheimer.\n\nHowever, the tactics deployed by Ciilian in achieving his new look, such as subsisting on just a single almond a day, may seem relatively tame by Hollywood standards.\n\nCillian's portrayal of the emaciated scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer, known for his diet of martinis and cigarettes, has caught the media's attention.\n\nCommenting on his drastic diet, the actor told The Guardian: \"I was running on crazy energy; I went over a threshold to where I was not worrying about food or anything. I was so in it, a state of hyper... hyper something, but it was good because the character was like that. He never ate.\"\n\n© Getty Christian Bale\n\nChristian Bale\n\nHowever, Cillian’s transformation is not the first instance of actors going to extreme lengths for their roles. Christian Bale, famously known for his drastic weight fluctuations, lost an astonishing 62lbs for his role in The Machinist.\n\nHe told GQ: \"Also, at the time I was engaged in a very filthy habit of smoking. So, I was rolling my own cigarettes and sitting there puffing away.\" This diet, comprising an apple, a tin of tuna, and black coffee, provided fewer than 200 calories per day, a significant departure from the recommended 2,500-calorie average for men.\n\nHis transformation did not go unnoticed, earning him a Best Actor nomination. However, the actor's pendulum-like physical changes have caught up with him. At the age of 45, he expressed concern about the impact of these extreme dieting practices on his health, stating: \"I just can't keep doing it. I really can't,\" he admitted. \"My mortality is staring me in the face.\"\n\n© Target Presse Agentur Gmbh/Getty Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson attends the Germany premiere of \"'All Things Fall Apart\"\n\nCurtis '50 Cent' Jackson\n\nSimilar sacrifices were made by rapper and actor Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson for his role in All Things Fall Apart. The star shed a whopping 54lbs in just nine weeks for his portrayal of a cancer-stricken football player. Jackson achieved this dramatic weight loss through a liquid diet and three-hour daily treadmill workouts.\n\nExplaining his motivation, Curtis revealed the tragic backstory of his best friend Charles Pringle, who suffered from cancer. He told Parade Magazine: \"The weight started coming off, and my manager told me: 'You better get yourself to a doctor!' I just didn't want to go because I had to match the look in my mind.\"\n\n© Gary Miller Matthew McConaughey at The Gentleman Q&A\n\nMatthew McConaughey\n\nAnother striking example is that of Matthew McConaughey, who lost 40lbs for his role in Dallas Buyers Club' He did this by consuming less than 500 calories per day, allowing him to portray the emaciated figure of a cowboy stricken with AIDS.\n\nBut the tables were turned in 2017 when Matthew needed to gain 47lbs for his role in Gold. During this time, he was labeled \"Captain Fun\" for his love of pizza nights and indulgence in cheeseburgers and beer.\n\n© Getty Images Charlize Theron attends the Fast X film premiere, the tenth film in the Fast & Furious Saga, at Colosseum in Rome\n\nCharlize Theron\n\nCharlize Theron's weight journey was the inverse of Murphy's. For her role in Tully, she had to gain 50lbs in just three months. Reflecting on the experience, Theron confessed, \"And then, after three weeks, it's not fun anymore. Like, all of a sudden, you're done eating that amount and then it becomes a job.\" This transformation took a toll on Charlize's health as she expressed: \"I was very heavy, literally and figuratively. My soul just felt really heavy on this film, and I was just really unhealthy.\"\n\n© Photo: Getty Images Chris Pratt\n\nChris Pratt\n\nChris Pratt's transformation from the lovable Andy Dwyer in Parks and Recreation to a muscular spacefarer in Guardians of the Galaxy is another remarkable instance. Chris, who lost 60lbs following a strict diet and exercise plan, said: \"I actually lost weight by eating more food, but eating the right food,\" he explained to PEOPLE magazine."

        "text": "July is going to be chock-a-block for moviegoers with a whole bunch of widely anticipated films dropping, starting on July 12 with Tom Cruise’s latest \"Mission: Impossible\" offering.\n\nNine days later, two others will go head to head at the box office – \"Oppenheimer,\" starring Cillian Murphy, and \"Barbie,\" fronted by Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, and a host of other notables, including Nicola Coughlan of \"Derry Girls.\"\n\nThat’s quite a competition brewing for audience dollars. There’s no question that \"Mission: Impossible\" will emerge as the summer box office champ – and quite possibly for the year – but what of \"Oppenheimer\" and \"Barbie\"?\n\nThis is Cork-born Murphy’s first time at the top of a blockbuster, and it’s got great advance word of mouth – no reviews yet, as they’re still embargoed – but according to early industry tracking Barbie will likely beat \"Oppenheimer\" when it comes to earnings, at least in the first few days after opening.\n\n\"Barbie,\" based on the real-life Mattel doll, vs. \"Oppenheimer,\" based on the creator of the atomic bomb. Let’s go!\n\n“From Warner Bros., Barbie could open to a beatific $70 million to $80 million, if not more, according to sources who have access to tracking data (and there’s plenty of upside). Warners is being more cautious, suggesting $60 million,” according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n“Universal and (writer-director Christopher) Nolan’s Oppenheimer is tracking for a domestic debut in the $40 million range. For Oppenheimer — an R-rated, three-hour drama targeting adults — having legs could prove far more important than its opening weekend haul.”\n\nOppenheimer has a top-tier cast that include Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh.\n\nBritish star Pugh said she was thrilled to work with Murphy: “It’s a Christopher Nolan movie, number one, and number two, he has one of the most incredible leads.\n\n\"Cillian Murphy is an actor that I have been watching for quite some time and have been desperate to work with for ages. You’d have to be mad to say no.\n\n\"It felt like I was playing sports with some of the best athletes, so it was truly one of the best experiences that I’ve had,” she recently told the press."

But they've kept their children mostly out of the spotlight... or so their fans thought.\n\nAran has chosen to follow in his famous dad's footsteps and has been busy carving out a career as an actor.\n\n© Getty Images Cillian shares two children with his wife Yvonne\n\nSeveral years ago, Aran took on the role as Hamnet - Shakespeare's prematurely dead son - and performed on stage in the UK, New York, Boston, and Hong Kong.\n\nMORE: Peaky Blinders star Cillian Murphy's private home life in Dublin home revealed\n\nPhotos from the predominantly one-man show prove that he bears an uncanny resemblance to his father.\n\nCillian, 47, applauded Aran's performance, as did The New York Times, and he told the publication: \"He was so chilled about it, you know? He would come off stage and ask what the score was in the Liverpool game. And, again, you’re slightly jealous of that!\n\n\"There’s the danger that over analyzing everything can erode the simplicity.\" Aran has also acted in the Andrew Legge-directed movie Lola.\n\nLittle is known about his future projects but Cillian and his family continue to live a low-key life in his home country of Ireland.\n\nThey made the decision to leave London eight years ago and he spoke to The Irish Sun about it: \"We were in London for 14 years, both our kids were born there and we only came back to Dublin in 2015,\" he said.\n\n\"It's kind of an Irish story to move away, do your thing and come home, that seems to be a common narrative for Irish people.

And you know, parents are at a certain age, it was just a nice time to come home.\"\n\nCillian is a family man, which made working on Peaky Blinders that much harder as for almost a decade, he was only home for half of the year at home as he filmed on location.\n\n© Photo: Getty Images Cillian and his family relocated back to Dublin\n\nSpeaking to GQ, he said: \"That work-life balance thing is hard. I have an amazing wife and I couldn't do this without her and her understanding. But it is a struggle. \"He continued: \"I think it is for any dad whose work takes him away, which it generally does, and which consumes him, which my work does."

        "text": "While fans eagerly await the upcoming movie Oppenheimer, no one who has watched Peaky Blinders can forget Irish actor Cillian Murphy’s iconic role in it. Playing the head of the Shelby family, Thomas “Tommy” Shelby, Murphy has etched his alpha male persona in the minds of his fans. Needless to say, when an actor is as good as Murphy, it might get hard to differentiate between his onscreen image and the one that he carries off-screen. Talking about this difference and how fans interpret it, the actor shared what he thinks about it. According to him, fans are a little “underwhelmed” by his real-life personality and it is all thanks to Thomas Shelby.\n\nFandomwire reported that Cillian Murphy is someone who does not like going out and about. In fact, the actor revealed that he is mostly at home or with his friends. Unless it is to promote one of his works, he does not even like being photographed. The actor said, “I don’t really partake. I don’t go out. I’m just at home mostly, or with my friends, unless I have a film to promote. I don’t like being photographed by people. I find that offensive.”\n\nThe actor went on to add that people expect him to be mysterious and charismatic like his on-screen persona from the hit family epic. However, the actor does not think that he could be more different than his character. Although he expressed that he is glad fans think of him that way. After all, for Murphy, it means that he is doing his job well. Fandomwire quoted him as saying, “I think it’s the Tommy Shelby thing. People expect this mysterious, swaggering, it’s just a character. I do feel people are a little bit underwhelmed.” He added, “That’s fine, it means I’m doing my job. Peaky fans are amazing. But sometimes I feel a little sad that I can’t provide, like, that charisma and swagger. He couldn’t be further from me.”\n\nMeanwhile, Oppenheimer is set to hit the theatres on July 21. It will star Cillian Murphy in the titular role of Physicist J Robert Oppenheimer. The film will recount the events of how a team of scientists was involved in the Manhattan Project. It was these events that leads to the development of the atomic bomb."

        "text": "Si el verano cinéfilo tuviese un nombre, sería el de Barbieheimer, ese Rumble in the jungle de la gran pantalla que presenciaremos a partir del próximo 21 de julio. Ese día, llega a España Barbie, de Greta Gerwig: un día después de aterrizar en nuestro país Oppenheimer, la nueva película de Christopher Nolan. El choque de fechas no ha entusiasmado, precisamente, al autor de Origen, según le han revelado a un periodista de Insider cuatro fuentes próximas al director.\n\nEn el mismo reportaje, Nolan negaba que, por el momento, hubiese visto Barbie, lo que parece ser su manera de decirnos que no esperemos una fotografía suya frente a la carátula de esta película mientras, con una sonrisa en la boca, agita en el aire una entrada de cine. Gerwig y Margot Robbie, en cambio, sí que han visto ya Oppenheimer. Y Cillian Murphy, que interpreta al padre de la bomba atómica, espera devolverles pronto el favor.\n\n“Voy a ver Barbie al 100%”, dijo Murphy en una entrevista para IGN. “Cuento las horas para verla y creo que es espléndido para la industria, y para los espectadores, que el mismo día se estrenen dos fantásticas películas, dirigidas por dos fantásticos cineastas”.\n\nPuede que Nolan no simpatice con la opinión del actor, con quien ha colaborado en seis películas incluida esta, pero si algo ha dejado claro Murphy desde que debutase en la gran pantalla hace veinticinco años es que él es una estrella de cine diferente. O que, mejor dicho, él es una estrella de cine, precisamente, porque ha hecho todo lo posible para evitarlo.\n\nCillian Murphy en 'Oppenheimer'. Yago García Salmerón\n\nEl rockero de las gafas de sol\n\nCualquiera que haya visto la serie Peaky Blinders recordará los ojos azules, pálidos y absorbentes de Cillian Murphy. No hay unos ojos como los suyos en toda la industria del cine. Son su seña de identidad, como lo era, para Kirk Douglas, el hoyuelo de su barbilla. Sin embargo, Murphy prefiere esconderlos tras unas gafas de sol siempre que tiene la posibilidad.\n\nEn una entrevista para ES Magazine, el irlandés hablaba de ello: simplemente, no le gusta que lo reconozcan. Para Murphy, el infierno debe tener un aspecto muy similar al de cientos y cientos de admiradores gritándote cuando sacas a pasear a tu perro. Por eso, Murphy, en su entrevista, se compadecía de Robert Pattinson, que ha padecido esta insufrible veneración desde que protagonizase Crepúsculo.\n\nCillian Murphy en 'Peaky Blinders' BBC\n\nSi hay el actor ha querido ser alguna vez una estrella, ha sido una estrella de rock: junto a su hermano, fundó la banda The Sons of Mr. Green Genes, que estuvo cerca de firmar un acuerdo con un importante sello discográfico británico. Los Murphy lo rechazaron: Páidi, el hermano menor de Cillian, no quería dejar la universidad y la cantidad de dinero que percibirían no convenció al dúo.\n\nSi albergas esperanzas de que retome su carrera musical, renuncia a ellas. No volveremos a ver a Tom Shelby con una guitarra eléctrica: Cillian Murphy le dijo a un periodista de The Guardian que el mundo de la música se había cerrado para él porque un intérprete con una banda de rock no sería tomado en serio por nadie. No sabemos si Keanu Reeves leyó esa entrevista.\n\nTráiler de 'OPPENHEIMER' - Cinemanía Tráiler de 'OPPENHEIMER' - Cinemanía\n\nEn cambio, y además de su amor imperecedero amor por Chet Baker y los Beatles, sí hay algo que Murphy ha mantenido de sus días como cantante: su mujer Yvonne Guinness, a la que conoció en un concierto. Poco más se conoce sobre su vida privada: tienen dos hijos, ella es artista (se dedica a la videoinstalación), él es vegetariano y, en su infancia, fue católico, pero ya no…\n\n“Yvonne no habla de mí y yo no hablo de ella”. Así es como Murphy suele zanjar toda cuestión referente a su vida al margen de las pantallas. Cuando le preguntaron si había colaborado alguna vez con Yvonne en una de sus exposiciones artísticas, el actor respondió: “Tenemos dos hijos. Creo que eso ya es suficiente colaboración por el momento”.\n\nCillian Murphy en 'Luces rojas' Warner Bros.\n\nCillian no ha podido venir\n\nUno aprende a valorar aún más la interpretación de Murphy en Peaky Blinders cuando descubre, o más bien entreve, al actor que se esconde bajo la peligrosa boina. Durante el rodaje de Oppenheimer en Nuevo México, elenco y equipo técnico se reunían para cenar juntos. La ubicación, pleno desierto, no ofrecía muchas más alternativas. Sin embargo, en estas cenas comunales solía faltar alguien: nada más y nada menos que el propio Oppenheimer.\n\n'Oppenheimer' Cinemanía\n\n“La presión y la responsabilidad que Cillian soportó durante la grabación fue monumental, y eso le impedía acompañarnos al final del día. Su cerebro estaba saturado”. De esta forma lo excusaron lo actores Emily Blunt y Matt Damon. Bueno, seguro que no es el peor pretexto que se haya empleado hasta ahora para no hacer vida social con tus compañeros de trabajo.\n\nEn una entrevista para Variety durante la promoción de Blonde, Ana de Armas apuntó a que si el star-system de Hollywood se había desmoronado era, en parte, por las redes sociales. El misterio que rodeaba a la estrella de cine era una parte esencial en su naturaleza y, sin él, no existía.\n\nDe una industria poblada por Monroe, Wayne, Taylor y Dean, se ha pasado a un cine en el que sólo Tom Cruise puede considerarse una auténtica estrella. Aunque, quizás, no deberíamos perder de vista la candidatura de Cillian Murphy. Y eso que él ha hecho todo lo posible para no convertirse en una.\n\nFotograma de 'Oppenheimer' Cinemanía\n\n¿Quieres recibir todos los viernes en tu correo las mejores recomendaciones de cine y series?

        "text": "Cillian Murphy posa a su llegada al estreno de la película Oppenheimer en Londres. Nolan lo eligió por primera vez como protagonista: \"Te ofrezco un personaje que va a exigirte que uses cada aspecto de tu talento y va a ponerte a prueba de un modo que nunca habías conocido\", le dijo (Vianney Le Caer/Invision/AP)\n\n“Llegó el momento, esta es la película en la que vas a ser el protagonista; te ofrezco un personaje que va a exigirte que uses cada aspecto de tu talento y va a ponerte a prueba de un modo que nunca habías conocido”, le dijo Christopher Nolan. El director, guionista y productor londinense había visto por primera vez a Cillian Murphy hace casi veinte años, cuando se presentó al casting de Batman Inicia (2005).\n\nTe puede interesar: “Oppenheimer” supera la controversia y llegará a los cines de Japón en 2024\n\nEl actor irlandés que se hizo famoso en todo el mundo como el líder de la pandilla criminal de Peaky Blinders –la serie de Netflix que emitió en abril del año pasado su última temporada– audicionó originalmente para el papel de Bruce Wayne, pero Nolan tenía otros planes para ese chico de mirada helada: Murphy no iba a ser su superhéroe, sino su supervillano, el Espantapájaros.\n\nHabía quedado fascinado con su estilo en 28 días después (2002): “Toda su apariencia, esa mirada… Tiene los ojos más extraordinarios. Me la paso inventando excusas para que se saque los anteojos en los primeros planos”, le dijo en pleno rodaje a Spin magazine sobre el irlandés que iba a convertirse en su fetiche, casi una cábala en varias de sus siguientes películas: en la trilogía de El caballero oscuro (2005-2012), en Inception (2010) y en Dunkerque (2017).\n\nEl director Christopher Nolan y Cillian Murphy se conocen desde que el actor tenía 28 años. Fue al casting de Batman inicia, pero el director no lo eligió, pensó que sus ojos gélidos eran perfectos para interpretar a El Espantapájaros (Vianney Le Caer/Invision/AP)\n\n“Sentí que no era el correcto para Batman, pero sin embargo era alguien con quien quería seguir creando, alguien con quien quería trabajar”, dijo en una entrevista de la época con IGN, y cumplió su palabra. Batman Inicia fue un éxito de crítica y taquilla, con una recaudación de casi US$100 millones y también la primera producción masiva con la que Murphy se abrió camino en Hollywood. Fue además el inicio de una colaboración entre el director y el actor de entonces 28 años. Nunca hasta Oppenheimer, el film sobre el padre de la bomba atómica que se estrena este jueves –y cuyo elenco se completa con primeras figuras como Matt Damon, Kenneth Branagh, Emily Blunt y Gary Oldman–, le había dado el rol principal. Murphy lo entendió desde el principio: “Si Christopher Nolan te pide que hagas algo, independientemente de la envergadura del papel, lo hacés”, dijo en medio de la gira promocional de la película para la que se preparó leyendo el texto sagrado hinduista Bhagavad Gita, de donde proviene la célebre cita que se le atribuye al físico Robert J. Oppenheimer luego de probar su creación por primera vez, en 1945: “Ahora me he convertido en la muerte, el destructor de mundos”.\n\nTe puede interesar: Murió Benjamin Zephaniah: “Peaky Blinders” y el legado artístico del activista británico\n\nTe puede interesar: “Oppenheimer”: quién es quién en la biopic del creador de la bomba atómica\n\nEl trailer de Oppenheimer, la película de Christopher Nolan que protagoniza Cillian Murphy poniéndose en la piel del creador de la bomba atómica\n\nHabía sido definido por la crítica de The New York Times Manohla Dargis como “el villano de película perfecto”. “Su mirada azul podría congelar el agua; su mirada lasciva sugiere sus propios terrores”, escribió tras su actuación como el psicópata que amedrentaba a Rachel McAdams en el thriller psicológico Red Eye, también en 2005.\n\nTe puede interesar: ¿“Peaky Blinders” tendrá una película? Cillian Murphy no descarta la idea tras el final de la exitosa serie\n\nPero nacido en un pueblo católico de las afueras de Cork, en Irlanda, donde la máxima atracción era la iglesia que le daba el nombre: Ballintemple (“el pueblo de la Iglesia”), el actor estaba lejos de haber sido educado como villano. Por el contrario, fue formado en los preceptos de la religión familiar y de los hermanos del colegio de curas en el que hizo la secundaria.\n\nEs cierto que durante la mayor parte del colegio tuvo problemas de conducta, pero cuando estaba en cuarto año descubrió que podía canalizar esa energía por medio de sus inclinaciones artísticas. Probó con las clases de actuación en Corcadorca, la compañía de teatro de Cork, y por primera vez se sintió “verdaderamente vivo”, aunque en esa época su mayor ambición era convertirse en una estrella de rock. Cantaba y tocaba la guitarra en una banda que formó junto a Páidi, uno de sus tres hermanos; y hasta les ofrecieron un contrato para grabar cuatro álbumes que el dúo rechazó porque les parecía poca plata a cambio de los derechos de “sus peculiares temas y sus solos interminables”, como él mismo los definió. Podían permitírselo; a diferencia de la infancia de privaciones de su Thomas Shelby de Peaky Blinders, Cillian creció en una familia relativamente acomodada: su padre trabajaba en el departamento de Educación de su distrito, y su madre era profesora de francés.\n\nCillian Thomas como Thomas Shelby en Peaky Blinder, la serie de Netflix que lo llevó al gran público y por la que tuvo que dejar de ser vegetariano, luego de veinte años sin comer carne, para poder sumar proteínas a su dieta (Zuma Press/The Grosby Group)\n\nEn 1996, a los 20 años –nació el 25 de mayo de 1976–, Murphy entró a la Facultad de Derecho de Cork, pero no aprobó un solo examen. Alguna vez explicó que ni siquiera se lo propuso, realmente no quería ser abogado. Ya había desistido de la idea de dedicarse a la música, pero el bichito de la actuación que le había picado en el colegio se acrecentó después de ver una obra de su profesor del Corcadorca y tuvo su primer papel importante junto al club de drama amateur de la Universidad. Sin embargo, su motivación por esos días era, según contó más tarde, la de muchos otros chicos de su edad: “Ir a fiestas y conocer mujeres”.\n\nAsí fue como consiguió entrar oficialmente a Corcadorca, donde actuó en varias obras y llegó a irse de gira por Europa, Australia y Canadá con Disco Pigs, que también fue adaptada al cine y le valió los primeros elogios de la prensa especializada. Así llegaría también su debut cinematográfico, precisamente en 28 días después, de Danny Boyle, donde Nolan le echó el ojo. Hacía de un sobreviviente de una pandemia que despertaba perplejo y desolado en un nuevo mundo después de un coma.\n\nCillian Murphy y su esposa Yvonne McGuinness, su único y gran amor. Están casados desde hace 18 años y son padre de Malachy -que nació en diciembre de 2005- y Aran -en julio de 2007- (Photo by Raymond Hall/GC Images)\n\nSu capacidad actoral sin duda era deslumbrante, pero lo que le daba el phisique du rol ideal para el papel, era su aspecto. Lo que la directora de casting había encontrado en él no era muy distinto de lo que pronto descubriría el director de Oppenheimer: “Murphy era tímido en el set, con una tendencia a mirar ligeramente por fuera de la cámara, tenía un tipo soñador y algo falto de energía, como si flotara, que era fantástico para la película”. Por ese trabajo logró su primera nominación como Revelación Masculina en los MTV Movie Awards de 2004.\n\nVolvió al cine con su compatriota Colin Farrell en la comedia negra Intermission (2004), que se convirtió en ese momento en el film independiente de origen irlandés de mayor recaudación en la historia. Y la crítica volvió a hablar de sus ojos gélidos: “Su intensidad es totalmente creíble; sus miradas delicadas, junto a su talento y expertise, son lo que hace que hoy la gente lo señale como el nuevo Farrell de Irlanda, aunque en una versión más sobria”, dijo el Herald Tribune.\n\nCillian Murphy como el Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer en una escena del film y el físico en una foto de época en el campo de pruebas de la bomba atómica cerca de Alamogordo, Nuevo México (Universal Pictures y AP)\n\nEsa apariencia misteriosa le permitió a Murphy sostenerse como una rara avis en Hollywood, a donde nunca quiso mudarse: no tiene agente, ni un entorno cerrado que lo acompañe a todas partes, y suele vérselo solo y con impecable estilismo –fue nombrado entre los 50 Mejor Vestidos de GQ en 2015– en las premières. Casi no da entrevistas (hasta hace una década se negaba incluso a ir a programas de televisión para promocionar sus películas), detesta las alfombras rojas, y asegura que practica intencionalmente una vida que no le interesa a los tabloides.\n\n“No genero controversias, no me acuesto con nadie por ahí, no me caigo borracho en lugares”, le dijo a The Sunday Times en 2004. Ya se destacaba por ser lo opuesto de su amigo Farrel –de los pocos que cuenta en el ambiente además de los también irlandeses Jonathan Rhys Meyers y Liam Neeson, a quien llama su padre cinematográfico–. Ese mismo año se casó con su novia de toda la vida, la artista visual Yvonne McGuinness, a quien conoció en un show de su banda en 1996. Vivieron juntos en Londres hasta 2015, cuando se instalaron en Dublin con sus hijos, Malachy (que nació en diciembre de 2005) y Aran (en julio de 2007).\n\nCillian Murphy con uno de sus hijos, en 2007, en una de las pocas fotos que los paparazzi han logrado (The Grosby Group)\n\nHasta hace poco, ninguno de sus dos hijos, hoy adolescentes, estaba familiarizado con el trabajo de su padre, más allá de saber que era actor. Ni Murphy ni su mujer querían exponerlos a la violencia de los papeles que suele desempeñar, así que ni siquiera veían sus películas. Lo que saben de su padre es que es ese tipo afable que disfruta del tiempo en casa, con ellos, y encuentra placer “en sacar la basura y ser parte del día a día en familia”.\n\nAlgo sí tiene en común con su mafioso Tom Shelby y es el valor que le da a su círculo cercano, su familia y esas personas que estaban ahí antes de que se hiciera conocido. “Mi vida es surreal. Hay que darse cuenta de la suerte que tenés y no darla por hecha. Este es un negocio difícil y ya estar trabajando es un mérito. Por eso amo volver a Cork y estar con mis amigos de siempre. Con ellos nunca hablo de la industria, porque no nos parece un asunto importante. No es relevante entre amigos que se conocen desde los diez años”, le dijo hace tiempo al Irish Independent. Poco más se sabe de su vida privada salvo eso: que prefiere reservarla para su intimidad.\n\nTe puede interesar: “Oppenheimer” demuestra su grandeza visual en un explosivo clip inédito\n\nCillian Murphy durante el Festival de Cannes: cumple con los compromisos de promoción de las películas pero detesta las alfombras rojas (Carlo Allegri/Getty Images)\n\n¿Qué fue primero, su halo de misterio natural o la convicción de preservar su mudo privado a rajatabla? Nadie puede saberlo igual que nadie sabe bien qué esconden sus ojos de hielo, esos capaces de “cortar diamantes”, como los describe la revista Night and Day. Cuando Nolan descubrió su perfil más oscuro, le llovieron las nominaciones como Mejor Villano. El crítico del New Yorker David Denby escribió después de ver a su Espantapájaros –o la representación misma del miedo–: “Tiene una mirada angelical que puede tornarse siniestra; es uno de los monstruos más elegantemente seductores del cine reciente”.\n\nLa sensación era unánime. Ese lugar de ángel negro le valdría muchos otros trabajos: de nuevo con Nolan; como el temible soldado del IRA Damien O’Donovan en la premiada The wind that shakes the barney (2006), de Ken Loach; o, más recientemente, como el sobreviviente perturbado de A quiet place II (2021).\n\nMurphy mostro su talento actoral no dejándose encasillar. Probó su versatilidad como una mujer trans irlandesa en la comedia dramática Desayuno en Plutón (2005)\n\nPero Murphy nunca se dejó encasillar. Probó su versatilidad como una mujer trans irlandesa en la comedia dramática Desayuno en Plutón (2005), la película con la que Neil Jordan intentó reivindicarse ante la comunidad después de El juego de las lágrimas (1992). Para ese papel se preparó montándose y yendo a clubs de crossdressers, aunque una vez más, ya llevaba en el cuerpo lo que se requería: su look andrógino era insuperable y verlo transformarse en una drag rubia en la pantalla parecía absolutamente natural.\n\nEn cambio sí tuvo que forzar su apariencia para la interpretación que lo metió desde 2013 en las casas del gran público, como el jefe gangster de Birmingham en Peaky Blinders (el final de la serie fue visto por 3,7 millones de espectadores). No sólo el acento “brummie”, casi imposible de imitar, que ensayó hasta la obsesión yendo a los pubs locales, donde grababa a los habitués –”Íbamos a tomar unas Guinness y todos cantaban canciones del Birmingham City y contaban historias que yo registraba en mi iPhone. Y cuando llegaba a casa, rastreaba cada acento y los probaba. Le dejaba mensajes a Steve (Knight, el creador de la serie británica) imitándolos para que se fijara lo cerca que estaba de sacarlo”–, sino su figura, hasta entonces más bien desgarbada, que tuvo que cambiar radicalmente para mostrarse más fuerte.\n\nLos actores Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Cillian Murphy y Florence Pugh en la premiere de Oppenheimer (EFE/EPA/ANDY RAIN)\n\nEse fue otro sacrificio que le exigió el rol de Thomas Shelby: tuvo que dejar de ser vegetariano luego de veinte años sin comer carne para poder sumar proteínas a su dieta. “Yo no era una persona físicamente imponente, no lo soy. Y tengo que comer muchísimas proteínas y levantar muchísimo peso para lograrlo. Todo eso me lleva tiempo, y lo detesto”, confió a Radio Times en una de las pocas notas que concedió para promocionar la última temporada de Peaky Blinders, donde mantuvo una vez más aquello de hablar sólo de su vida profesional.\n\nEs lo mismo que hace ahora durante la rueda por el estenos de Oppenheimer, donde se centra únicamente en su personaje, en su relación con el director que le dio su primera gran oportunidad y en cómo los dos se comprometieron a retratar la inmensa inteligencia y los conflictos morales del físico: “Siempre andábamos buscando la complejidad de Oppenheimer, porque no era un tipo simple –le dijo a Marca–. Tener esa gran inteligencia puede ser una carga; la gente así opera en un plano completamente diferente al de los meros mortales como nosotros, y eso conlleva sus propias complicaciones y desafíos en su vida personal y moral. Eso fue uno de los retos más difíciles: trazar el viaje moral de Oppenheimer a través de la historia, porque se mueve por terreno cenagoso en términos de lo que le puede plantear su trabajo en el Proyecto Manhattan y luego, años más tarde, su posición respecto a la política nuclear después de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, y cómo ir cambiando de postura y evolucionando lo hace entrar en conflicto con otra gente”.\n\n“Siempre andábamos buscando la complejidad de Oppenheimer, porque no era un tipo simple. Tener esa gran inteligencia puede ser una carga; la gente así opera en un plano completamente diferente al de los meros mortales como nosotros\", dijo antes de la premiere de Oppenheimer\n\nTambién aceptó sus limitaciones frente a la figura histórica que interpretó: “La mayoría de las personas no pueden pensar ni piensan en la existencia humana, la estructura del mundo y nuestro lugar en el universo del modo en que lo hacía Oppenheimer, a través de la lente de la mecánica cuántica, con sus complejidades y su aprecio por las paradojas”. Por eso, según explicó en la misma nota “hubiera sido absurdo” para él intentar entenderlo todo. “Basta con tratar de entender vagamente los conceptos para luego profundizar en eso y extraer la humanidad, que es lo que de verdad importa para nuestra película”, dijo.\n\nPero el lado más humano de Murphy sigue estando reservado para unos pocos elegidos. A dos décadas de su desembarco en la industria, logró instalarse con sus propias reglas, siempre alejado de la carnicería de los tabloides, jamás revelando nada que no quisiera. Sabe que la clave de ese triunfo personal también está escrita en su mirada, esa que a veces lo separa también a él del resto de los mortales. Ciertamente, sabe que fue más fuerte que el acento local y el entrenamiento a la hora de volver creíble el poder de su criatura más famosa y también vale para imponerse ante la prensa con su distancia elegante: “Es la manera en la que mira a las personas. Esa quietud, su frialdad, lo que los paraliza”.\n\nSeguir leyendo:"

So far he said he had made about 150 shirts, with a second batch of about 70 more on the way. It takes him about 45 minutes to an hour to make one T-shirt, which he does by cutting two shirts in half, pinning them together and sewing and pressing them.\n\n“I had a couple of movie theaters reach out to me privately to do bulk orders for employees,” he said. “It’s been overwhelmingly positive.”"

        "text": "Barbenheimer and Beyond: Hollywood's Greatest Box Office Showdowns\n\nAs the battle of Barbenheimer is decided, we look back on some other classic pairings of films that came out on the same day\n\nImage by Hamza Rasheed\n\nPublished Jul 20, 2023\n\nWhen Warner Bros. Pictures announced the release date for Barbie at CinemaCon in April 2022, eagle-eyed film fans were quick to note that Oppenheimer 's release date, which was announced in late 2021, was scheduled for the same weekend. As July 21, 2023 approached, Barbie's marketing painted cities pink and the internet delighted in sharing memes of the famously introverted Cillian Murphy, Oppenheimer's lead, minding his own business. The diametrically opposed movies offer something for everyone, but their box office battle is more than just a pink explosion for the internet.As pandemic-induced restrictions began to ease, Warner Bros. announced that their entire 2021 slate was going to be released simultaneously in theatres and on HBO Max (as it was then called). In response, Christopher Nolan, one of the studio's most prominent directors, was outspoken in his criticism of the move, describing the decision as making \"no economic sense.\" Although WB was Nolan's home for the better part of 20 years, it was of little surprise that he began shopping his latest film to other studios after their public falling out. It's of even littler surprise that his former employer has decisively pulled out all the stops in their counter-programming strategy.\"Barbenheimer\" isn't the first time two big titles face off at the box office — it isn't even the first time Universal Pictures, Warner Bros. and Nolan have danced this dance. From '80s tentpoles to Christmas fare, we look back at some of the greatest (and most curious) box office showdowns in cinema history.As for Barbie vs. Oppenheimer, who will come out on top is anyone's guess. Nolan's fanbase is ardent and IMAX-happy, but it's hard to discount the fact that Barbie feels like a moment. For my money, it's a peculiarly excellent double feature waiting to happen: come on, Oppy, let's go party.While the box office numbers may seem wildly lopsided, it's important to note that The Shining only released on 10 screens during the Memorial Day weekend compared to The Empire Strikes Back's 126 theatres (the latter also began showing in cinemas two days earlier). Empire would go on to be the top domestic grossing film of 1980 (The Shining was twelfth) and set a new standard for how good sequels could be — but Stanley Kubrick's iconic film, though met with mixed reviews on its initial release, is now considered a bonafide classic in its own right.There are many films that can be considered decade-defining in the '80s, but Ghostbusters and Gremlins represented a shift in the horror genre with the addition of pure comedy; perhaps in keeping with the tubular '80s, viewers looked for the humour in even the most terrifying scenes. However, for some parents, Gremlins took this concept a bit too far, with many not realizing the film was not suitable for children, prompting many to walk out before the film ended that opening weekend. It's rather fitting that two films so emblematic of the decade would be released on the same weekend, with just $1.1 million separating the two.Considering Point Break opened in twice the amount of theatres as Boyz n the Hood, John Singleton's seminal film is the emphatic winner in this SoCal movie competition. Although the two films have a shared location (sort of), Boyz n the Hood's authentic exploration of a much-maligned neighbourhood has cemented it as an American classic, while Point Break continues to delight as a pulpy cop thriller. Neither film toppled Terminator 2: Judgment Day in its second weekend (or earned more than the fourth theatrical re-release of 101 Dalmatians), but they are still beloved by audiences today, albeit for very different reasons.On the surface, it feels like an unfair comparison. The Matrix was one of the biggest cinematic events in the '90s and had an instant impact on pop culture that continues to resonate today. But in 1999, the teen high school comedy really was all the rage. Similar to how I imagine the crowds for Barbie and Oppenheimer will be, The Matrix brought out all the sci-fi boys to the yard, while 10 Things I Hate About You seemed destined to fulfill the angst-ridden high schooler of the day. Both movies have continued to find life beyond their theatrical releases, but one was just on a slightly larger scale than the other.The tale of two Christmases, Elf and Love Actually appeal to different sides of the yuletide from different sides of the pond. Given that Love Actually is a distinctly British film, it's surprising that it was released in the US and Canada two weeks ahead of the UK (where Love Actually topped Elf). Canadian and American audiences were decidedly Team Buddy upon their debuts, but both films have found a place in many households during Christmas. (Fun fact: The Matrix Revolutions was also released on this day and took the top spot at the box office that weekend with $48 million.)Christopher Nolan, Universal Pictures and Warner Bros. were once again behind the ultimate counter-programming move, although the parties were all on different sides than for today's Oppenheimer/Barbie showdown. Nolan and WB were in the midst of their successful partnership, and excitement was exceptionally high for the director's follow-up to 2005's Batman Begins. Universal, in a bid to cut into their competitor's box office receipts, released a rom-com musical, but to no avail. Not only did The Dark Knight crush Mamma Mia! in its opening weekend, it also became the top-grossing film of the year, crossing the $1 billion mark worldwide."

July 21, 2023, marked one such milestone, with the emergence of an Internet phenomenon known as “Barbenheimer.” This viral sensation revolved around two films with seemingly opposite genres and themes – “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” – both set to hit theaters simultaneously. As the amalgamation of these titles suggests, the trend captured the attention of millions, showcasing the powerful impact of social media on shaping the film industry’s future.\n\nThe term “Barbenheimer” was coined by online fandoms, who quickly embraced the dual theatrical release of the two movies. Through hashtags, memes, and creative fan-made content, social media became the driving force behind the success of this cinematic experiment. The interplay between die-hard fans, curious cinephiles, and casual moviegoers led to an unprecedented buzz, leading to an influx of bookings across theaters worldwide.\n\nI've been seeing a lot of incredible fan art, mashups and parody posters for what is now known as \"Barbenheimer\". Felt inspired and thought I'd join in on the fun! So here's a little Photoshop fun by me for the DOUBLE FEATURE OF THE CENTURY! 👠💥😎 pic.twitter.com/qUmDkbIMso — Steve Reeves (@stevereevesart) July 11, 2023\n\nAMC Theaters, one of the largest cinema chains, exemplified the tangible influence of social media on this unique event. More than 20,000 of their AMC Stubs members proudly proclaimed their intent to witness both films on the same day. The phenomenon sparked conversations and debates that extended far beyond cinema seats, permeating various online platforms, news outlets, and even academic discussions.\n\nBut what exactly were the implications of Barbenheimer, and how did social media facilitate this groundbreaking marketing success? As industry experts delve into the matter, several key factors come to light. The intertwining of social media and film promotion has proven to be a potent force, capable of not only generating hype but also shaping the narrative surrounding these movies.\n\nThrough interactive campaigns, directors, producers, and studios harnessed the power of user-generated content, turning fans into enthusiastic brand ambassadors. As audiences shared their anticipation, speculations, and personal connections to both Barbie and Oppenheimer, the films acquired a life of their own, transforming into cultural touchstones even before their official release.\n\nAdditionally, the ease of communication on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube facilitated instant feedback loops. Filmmakers could gauge public sentiment and adjust their marketing strategies accordingly, creating a symbiotic relationship with their audience. The barrier between creators and consumers blurred, opening up new possibilities for more inclusive storytelling.\n\nAs we explore the realm of Barbenheimer and social media’s impact on the film industry, this blog post will delve into the underlying mechanisms that made this viral event possible. From the role of online fandoms in shaping modern cinema to the influence of social media in constructing movie identities, we aim to provide an expert analysis of the convergence between art, marketing, and the digital age.\n\nWhat is Barbenheimer?\n\nBarbenheimer is a portmanteau of the words “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” two major summer blockbusters that are set to be released on the same weekend, July 21, 2023. Fans first argued about whether the film was better and which one they would watch, but then wondered, “Why not both?” As a result, the name “Barbenheimer” was coined, and viewers promised to sit through both films in their entirety on the same day. Fans even created a trailer for it!\n\nThe popularity of the fad on the internet has helped make it a marketing success. For instance, AMC Theatres stated that more than 20,000 of its AMC Stubs members had purchased tickets to see both films on the same day. Barbenheimer became so popular that even merchants began to be made about it. When you go to a movie right now, you’re more likely to see one of these than just the Oppenheimer t-shirt.\n\nmy tshirt arrived pic.twitter.com/U5UHZpGfSc — laila 🌿THREE TIME EMMY NOMINEE PEDRO PASCAL (@falconsnat) June 29, 2023\n\nHere are some of the reasons why Barbenheimer is trending:\n\nThe two films are both major blockbusters that are set to be released on the same weekend.\n\nThe films are very different from each other, which has created a lot of anticipation and debate about which film will be more successful.\n\nThe term Barbenheimer is catchy and easy to remember, which has helped it to spread quickly on social media.\n\nThe dating trend that has been dubbed “Barbenheimer” is also generating a lot of buzz.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how Barbenheimer plays out in the coming weeks and months. Will it become a box office success? Will it become a lasting cultural phenomenon? Only time will tell.\n\nActors also love the idea of “Barbenheimer”\n\nActors from both “Oppenheimer” and “Barbie” seem enthusiastic about the idea; in fact, “Barbie” star Margot Robbie has already planned out her ideal “Barbenheimer” weekend.\n\nAt Wednesday’s London premiere of her film, Robbie said, “It’s a perfect double bill.” In my opinion, “I think actually start your day with ‘Barbie,’ then go straight into ‘Oppenheimer’ and then a ‘Barbie’ chaser.”\n\nRyan Gosling, who plays Ken in “Barbie,” agreed, stating he would first watch “Barbie,” then “‘Oppenheimer’ for lunch,” and then “Barbie” again.\n\nCillian Murphy, who plays the protagonist in “Oppenheimer,” told IGN that he “100 percent” intended to see “Barbie” and that Barbenheimer was “just great for the industry and for audiences … you can spend the whole day in the cinema. What’s better than that?”\n\nSocial media’s effect on the film industry and marketing\n\nBarbenheimer is just the latest example of social media’s effect on the film industry and marketing. Social media has revolutionized the film industry and transformed how movies are marketed and experienced. Here are some key ways in which social media has had a profound effect on the film industry and its marketing strategies:\n\nAudience engagement and interaction: Social media platforms provide an unprecedented opportunity for filmmakers and studios to engage directly with their audience. Through official accounts, hashtags, and live Q&A sessions, filmmakers can interact with fans, respond to questions, and build a sense of community. This engagement fosters a deeper emotional connection between the audience and the film, driving anticipation and word-of-mouth marketing.\n\nSocial media platforms provide an unprecedented opportunity for filmmakers and studios to engage directly with their audience.

Viral marketing and fandom culture: Social media thrives on viral content, and films with dedicated fan bases can leverage this phenomenon to their advantage. Fandoms play a crucial role in generating buzz around movies, with fan art, fan theories, and fan fiction becoming significant drivers of online conversations. Studios recognize the value of these fan-driven initiatives, often incorporating fan-generated content into official marketing campaigns to amplify the movie’s reach.\n\nSocial media thrives on viral content, and films with dedicated fan bases can leverage this phenomenon to their advantage.

Data-driven insights from social media help studios identify trends, target specific demographics, and understand audience preferences better.\n\nSocial media platforms offer filmmakers and marketing teams real-time feedback on trailers, teasers, and other promotional materials.

Influencer partnerships offer a way to access niche audiences, generating interest and excitement among groups that might not typically engage with traditional marketing channels. Extended storytelling and transmedia campaigns: Social media allows filmmakers to extend storytelling beyond the confines of the movie screen. They can create transmedia campaigns that incorporate interactive elements, alternate reality games, and online puzzles, enriching the movie’s universe and keeping audiences engaged long after the film’s release. This approach transforms the film into a multi-platform experience, enticing fans to explore the narrative across different media channels.\n\nSocial media allows filmmakers to extend storytelling beyond the confines of the movie screen.

It also facilitates discussions and reactions across diverse cultures, giving rise to a broader exchange of ideas and perspectives.\n\nSocial media transcends geographical boundaries, enabling movies to reach a global audience instantly.

It also facilitates discussions and reactions across diverse cultures, giving rise to a broader exchange of ideas and perspectives. Crowdsourced marketing and user-generated content: Audiences have become active participants in film marketing through user-generated content (UGC). Fans create memes, trailers, and promotional videos, sharing them across social media platforms, effectively becoming co-creators of the movie’s marketing campaign. This organic sharing enhances the film’s visibility, authenticity, and credibility.\n\nHow AI and big data analytics are changing influencer marketing\n\nIn conclusion, social media’s effect on the film industry and marketing has been transformative. It has empowered audiences, broken down barriers between filmmakers and fans, and opened up new avenues for creativity and engagement. As social media platforms continue to evolve, the film industry must adapt and harness the power of these digital tools to stay connected with audiences and drive success in an ever-competitive landscape.\n\nFeatured image credit: DiscussingFilm"

The other is Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer. One is sunny, the other is about the atomic bomb. Such contrast! Everyone on the internet was making jokes and having a fun time.\n\nUntil the middle of the week, when United States Senators and their social media teams entered the joke landscape.\n\nAs best we can tell, the virus began on Tuesday, when Will, a student at Tufts, tweeted the following.\n\nWhich of your state’s senators is seeing the Barbie and which is seeing Oppenheimer?

One film, after all, is about a plastic doll and her boyfriend. The other is about Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who helped the United States develop the first nuclear bomb and changed the course of the Second World War.\n\nGiven the enduring popularity of Barbie, it's maybe no great surprise that her first outing on the big screen is expected to emerge triumphant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's predicted to gross between $70 million and $80 million on its first three days in US theaters, according to internal projections from Warner Bros. seen by The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThat's as much as double the $40 million that Universal Pictures expects \"Oppenheimer\" to take in the same period, per the report. (Part of the discrepancy may be length: \"Oppenheimer\" runs for three hours, which means theaters can't squeeze in as many screenings of it as they can of \"Barbie,\" which comes in at a touch under two hours.)\n\nCillian Murphy plays the nuclear physicist in \"Oppenheimer.\" Eamonn McCormack/Getty Images\n\nWhile both movies cost about $100 million to make, the marketing hype for \"Barbie\" continues to amaze many observers. There's even a full-scale replica of Barbie's Malibu Dream house listed on Airbnb.\n\nNo matter who wins, the feud may be less contentious than audiences have been led to believe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCritics point out that the competing releases are a top-notch example of \"counter-programming\" by both studios – a reference to simultaneously releasing titles that'll appeal to very different audiences.\n\nThe biggest audience for Gerwig's film, which stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, is likely to be women under 35, per The Hollywood Reporter. The trade publication points out that it's the same demographic that helped turn the \"Mamma Mia\" and \"Sex and the City\" movies into box-office monsters.\n\nNolan, meanwhile, will be hoping that his latest feature, which boasts an A-list cast, erases memories of \"Tenet,\" which bombed after being released in theaters (at his insistence) at the height of the pandemic in 2020.\n\nOf course, as Ryan Gilbey notes for The Guardian, \"there will be some overlap between their audiences.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if you are planning on catching them on the same day, my Insider colleagues Rebecca Cohen and Chris Panella have come up with the perfect schedule for a Barbenheimer double bill, no matter which you see first.\n\nAs they point out: \"While 'Barbie' calls for fruity cocktails and clubbing with the girls, 'Oppenheimer' gives off more of a black coffee and cigarette energy.\"\n\nWhichever film takes the weekend, it's unlikely that either one will beat out \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie,\" which had the best debut of the year. The Nintendo flick is also the highest-grossing film of 2023, making more than $1.3 billion globally.\n\n\"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\" and \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" both made it into nine figures on their opening weekends, taking $120 million and $118 million respectively, according to Comscore figures reported by Variety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOverall it's been a much better year for theaters, with US ticket sales sitting just over $4.3 billion at the six-month mark – up by 20% over 2022, per Comscore.\n\nThat's before the release of more blockbusters, including \"Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One\" and, of course, \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer.\"\n\nAnd no matter what happens on July 21, one thing is certain: As David Gross, who writes a box office newsletter, told The New York Times: \"Audiences are going to find them, and both films are going to do extremely well.\""

Robert Oppenheimer) and Greta Gerwig's movie \"Barbie\" (about the Mattel doll) are both being released on the same day has delighted fans. People are creating schedules for back-to-back viewings. There are plans for what to eat and drink. There are even plans on what to wear.\n\nAnd then there are the memes.\n\nIn an interview with BBC Radio 1 on July 18, Margot Robbie, who stars as Barbie in the titular movie, and Ryan Gosling, who plays Ken, shared their thoughts on the \"Barbenheimer\" memes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked if she had seen the memes, Robbie said that her friends have been sending her a lot of them. \"People are so clever, people who come up with those funny memes,\" she said.\n\nAt the end of the interview, Gosling managed to create a new meme all by himself when he asked, \"What is a meme?\"\n\nTwitter users were quick to pick up on Gosling's reference to \"Oppenheimer\" actor Cillian Murphy, who once asked the same question in an interview with NME.\n\n\"He knew exactly what he was doing there,\" tweeted one user.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Ali showing once again why he's the best at this. Congrats on the birth of a new meme,\" tweeted another.\n\nMeanwhile, Twitter users were creating memes of their own.\n\n\"I feel like this is the Grimace Shake, but for #Barbenheimer. I obviously loved it,\" one user tweeted, referring to the recent viral McDonald's Grimace Shake trend.\n\n\"I love that fans are taking the oppenheimer press into their own hands,\" read another tweet referencing ths smoking pink Barbie house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTikTok users are also creating videos to celebrate the release. The #Barbenheimer hashtag currently has 109 million views.\n\nOne user, who goes by the username @alysilverio, shared a video of a Barbie-themed party she'd thrown. The caption read, \"pov: you throw a barbie themed party and the boys show up like this.\"\n\nIn the video, the men walk through the door wearing flat caps and waistcoats, presumably representing characters from \"Oppenheimer.\" They are greeted by a group of women dressed entirely in pink.\n\nOne of the women is holding a Barbie-themed cake, which the TikTok creator made in a previous TikTok video.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You mean peaky blinders?\" the top comment read.\n\nAnother comment read, \"Wow, that's so Ken of them actually.\"\n\nIn another video that has 3.5 million views, Tess Donatello, who goes by the TikTok username @tessdonatello, showed herself taking off her black \"Oppenheimer\"-themed outfit, to reveal her pink Barbie-themed outfit underneath.\n\n\"BYE THIS ATE,\" read the top comment, which has 59,700 likes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWarner Bros. predicts that \"Barbie\" will take up to $80 million in its first three days — about double the $40 million that Universal Pictures expects \"Oppenheimer\" to take in the same period.\n\nSources told Insider's Jason Guerrasio that \"Oppenheimer\" writer and director Christopher Nolan wasn't thrilled the studio wanted to release \"Barbie\" the same weekend as \"Oppenheimer.\"\n\nIn a recent interview with Guerrasio about whether \"Barbenheimer\" is \"strictly pettiness\" by Warner Bros, Nolan said, \"Now, you must know I'm not going to answer that question, only to say those who care about the theatrical experience, we've been longing for a crowded marketplace with a lot of different movies. That's what theaters have now, and those of us who care about movies are thrilled about that.\"\n\nThere's still time for even more memes and videos to surface before both movies are released on July 21. The fun has just begun."

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMillions of people are buzzing to see \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" this weekend — a cinematic showdown and pop-culture phenomenon dubbed \"Barbenheimer\" by some. Warren Buffett has nodded to both the iconic doll and the father of the atomic bomb over the years.\n\nThe famed investor debuted a set of four exclusive Barbies during Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in 2000. The dolls were cobranded with See's Candies, the Berkshire-owned confectioner that Buffett has hailed as his dream business.\n\nA glamorous blonde assistant in a See's Candies uniform brought two of the dolls to the stage where Buffett and his business partner, Charlie Munger, were seated. She pecked Munger on the cheek, prompting Buffett to quip, \"It's just a sample of what it's like to be an officer at Berkshire.\"\n\n\"This is the new See's Barbie doll,\" Buffett declared. \"And believe it or not, we've come up with three more just like this young woman.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We wanted our shareholders to be the first ones to have a shot at this new product,\" the Berkshire CEO continued, adding cheekily, \"The model is not included.\"\n\nThe lighthearted moment can be watched in full on CNBC's Warren Buffett Archive.\n\nOn a far more serious note, Buffett has frequently touched on J. Robert Oppenheimer's signature creation, the atomic bomb. He's repeatedly underscored the immense threat that nuclear weapons pose to the world.\n\n\"I've been concerned since 1945 when the first atomic bomb was used,\" Buffett said in 2017. \"We have developed over these 72 years, since August of 1945, the ability around the world to almost destroy civilization.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In 1945, we unleashed something like the world had never seen, and that is a pop gun compared to what can be done now,\" he noted during Berkshire's yearly gathering in 2016.\n\nBuffett also called nuclear weapons \"the ultimate problem of mankind\" in 2006. Moreover, the billionaire said in 2016 that if he could reduce the risk of a major nuclear, chemical, biological, or cyber attack by even 5%, he would commit all his wealth toward achieving that goal.\n\nThe Berkshire chief has also asserted that a US president's top priority should be combating those threats, and warned a major nuclear attack is one of the few things that could bankrupt his company.\n\nBuffett hasn't said whether he's going to see \"Barbie\" or \"Oppenheimer\" this weekend. Given he's drummed up demand for special-edition dolls, and banged the drum on nuclear threats, neither option seems out of the question."

        "text": "Nobody would have believed if they were told at the start of 2023 that Oppenheimer and Barbie would be two of the most anticipated movies in India. However, there is massive excitement among Indian viewers for Barbenheimer, both releasing on July 21.\n\nAdvance bookings for the opening day in the top three national chains alone exceeded all predictions, with around three lakh tickets sold for both movies combined, Pinkvilla reported.\n\nFor the opening day, Oppenheimer has managed to sell over two lakh tickets while Barbie followed closely behind with over 80 thousand tickets sold in the top three national chains, as per the publication. These numbers indicate a combined box office collection of anywhere between ₹15 to 20 crores nett, primarily driven by audiences in metro cities, Pinkvilla added.\n\nRenowned screenwriter Paul Schrader earlier expressed his admiration for Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, likening it to his own iconic works such as \"Taxi Driver\" and \"Raging Bull.\" Calling it the \"most important film of this century,\" Schrader encouraged viewers to experience Oppenheimer's brilliance on the big screen.\n\nAcross the Pacific, Greta Gerwig's Barbie is projected to surpass Oppenheimer in the US box office race, boasting a star-studded cast featuring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. The film is expected to make a dazzling $110 million debut, with industry analysts even predicting it could reach as high as $140 million. Warner Bros, the distributor of \"Barbie,\" remains more cautious, anticipating a $75 million opening in the US market.\n\nInterestingly, while Barbie is dominating the US box office, Oppenheimer's appeal in India is soaring, probably due to Christopher Nolan's esteemed reputation as one of the finest filmmakers of his generation.

        "text": "The incongruous duo of “Barbie,” a hot-pink comedic romp, and “Oppenheimer,” a brooding period drama, combined to sell far more movie tickets than expected over the weekend, pushing the overall domestic box office to $311 million, according to Box Office Mojo, an online database. It was the biggest weekend haul in North America since 2019, and the fourth-largest ever, before adjusting for inflation.\n\nIt is a sign that Hollywood has, maybe, finally bounced back from the pandemic. (Whether the film business, which is dealing with dual writers’ and actors’ strikes, can keep the momentum going is another question.)\n\nThe weekend was also noteworthy for its variety, with “Barbie” collecting $162 million, “Oppenheimer” $82.4 million and the rest of the features, including “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” and “Sound of Freedom,” adding more than $66 million.\n\nTypically, the biggest weekends for domestic ticket sales have been dominated by a single blockbuster. During the highest grossing weekend, in April 2019, “Avengers: Endgame” accounted for nearly 90 percent of the box office. “Barbie,” by comparison, accounted for just over half of the box office over the weekend."

        "text": "The story tracks Oppenheimer — played with feverish intensity by Cillian Murphy — across decades, starting in the 1920s with him as a young adult and continuing until his hair grays. The film touches on personal and professional milestones, including his work on the bomb, the controversies that dogged him, the anti-Communist attacks that nearly ruined him, as well as the friendships and romances that helped sustain yet also troubled him. He has an affair with a political firebrand named Jean Tatlock (a vibrant Florence Pugh), and later weds a seductive boozer, Kitty Harrison (Emily Blunt, in a slow-building turn), who accompanies him to Los Alamos, where she gives birth to their second child.\n\nIt’s a dense, event-filled story that Nolan — who’s long embraced the plasticity of the film medium — has given a complex structure, which he parcels into revealing sections. Most are in lush color; others in high-contrast black and white. These sections are arranged in strands that wind together for a shape that brings to mind the double helix of DNA. To signal his conceit, he stamps the film with the words “fission” (a splitting into parts) and “fusion” (a merging of elements); Nolan being Nolan, he further complicates the film by recurrently kinking up the overarching chronology — it is a lot.\n\nIt also isn’t a story that builds gradually; rather, Nolan abruptly tosses you into the whirl of Oppenheimer’s life with vivid scenes of him during different periods. In rapid succession the watchful older Oppie (as his intimates call him) and his younger counterpart flicker onscreen before the story briefly lands in the 1920s, where he’s an anguished student tormented by fiery, apocalyptic visions. He suffers; he also reads T.S. Eliot’s “The Waste Land,” drops a needle on Stravinsky’s “The Rite of Spring” and stands before a Picasso painting, defining works of an age in which physics folded space and time into space-time.\n\nThis fast pace and narrative fragmentation continue as Nolan fills in this Cubistic portrait, crosses and recrosses continents and ushers in armies of characters, including Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh), a physicist who played a role in the Manhattan Project. Nolan has loaded the movie with familiar faces — Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Gary Oldman — some distracting. It took me a while to accept the director Benny Safdie as Edward Teller, the theoretical physicist known as the “father of the hydrogen bomb,” and I still don’t know why Rami Malek shows up in a minor part other than he’s yet another known commodity.\n\nAs Oppenheimer comes into focus so does the world. In 1920s Germany, he learns quantum physics; the next decade he’s at Berkeley teaching, bouncing off other young geniuses and building a center for the study of quantum physics. Nolan makes the era’s intellectual excitement palpable — Einstein published his theory of general relativity in 1915 — and, as you would expect, there’s a great deal of scientific debate and chalkboards filled with mystifying calculations, most of which Nolan translates fairly comprehensibly. One of the film’s pleasures is experiencing by proxy the kinetic excitement of intellectual discourse."

        "text": "It’s billed as a biopic of theoretical physicist J Robert Oppenheimer, dubbed the “father of the atomic bomb”. But “biopic” seems too small a word to contain the ambition and scope of Christopher Nolan’s formidable if occasionally unwieldy latest. Oppenheimer is a dense and intricate period piece, playing out in a tangle of timelines. It weaves together courtroom drama, romantic liaisons, laboratory epiphanies and lecture hall personality cults. But perhaps more than all of this, Oppenheimer is the ultimate monster movie. Cillian Murphy’s Oppenheimer is an atomic-age Frankenstein, a man captivated by the boundless possibilities of science, realising too late that his creation has a limitless capacity for destruction. Ultimately, however, the monster in this story is not Oppenheimer’s invention but the appetite for annihilation that it unleashes in mankind. It’s a realisation that plays out, inexorably, in Oppenheimer’s hollow, haunted face as the film unfolds. Murphy’s far-seeing ice-chip eyes have never been put to better use.\n\nIn fact, Murphy’s physicality as a whole is one of the most potent weapons at the film’s disposal. He seems impossibly slight, a theoretical idea of a man in contrast to the robust certainties of the military figures he works alongside (Matt Damon’s Lt Gen Leslie Groves, for example, is bullish and solid, a clenched fist looking for something to punch). In one shot we see Oppenheimer hauling an armful of books into a new classroom, and it looks as though he’s buckling under the weight of his accumulated knowledge. At other times he’s calm and glassily composed, somehow removed from jostling egos and the fusion of ideas that will take shape into the ultimate weapon.\n\nGiven Nolan’s preference for shooting on Imax 70mm film, the picture has a depth of detail you could drown in\n\nThe version of Oppenheimer that we see on screen at any given time is a marker, an indication of which timeline we are currently inhabiting. Insights into his stellar early academic career are punctuated by glimpses of a later humiliating security clearance hearing that picked over every aspect of his life; the development of the bomb – the so-called Manhattan Project – is cut together with another hearing, this time in the Senate, to establish whether Oppenheimer’s former colleague Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr, excellent) should be appointed in a federal government role. It’s a knotty mesh of a structure. Time in Oppenheimer doesn’t feel entirely linear – there are moments, in particular a pivotal encounter with Albert Einstein, that seem unmoored from the rest of the film. Nolan’s films frequently require a couple of viewings to unravel fully, and while it lacks the baffle-factor of Tenet, Oppenheimer is no exception.\n\n‘A clenched fist looking for something to punch’: Matt Damon, left, as Lt Gen Leslie Groves, with Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer. AP\n\nThere are other problems: the cursory treatment of the female characters is one. Florence Pugh, as Oppenheimer’s mistress Jean Tatlock, gets short shrift. And Emily Blunt, as J Robert’s wife Kitty Oppenheimer, spends much of the first two hours mutinously clutching a martini on the edge of the frame. She does, however, claim a couple of terrific moments later on: a skin-flaying interrogation scene; a wordless glare that conveys the full nuclear winter of her animosity towards a disloyal colleague.\n\nBut, for the most part, the film is a towering achievement. Not surprisingly, given Nolan’s preference for shooting on Imax 70mm film, the picture has a depth of detail you could drown in. There’s no shortage of scenes of furious blackboard scribbling, the accepted cinematic signifier of scientific genius. But more interesting are the abstract moments; it’s as though we are venturing into the heart of the atom itself. Equally inventive is the way the sets seem to quake at moments of tension. Oppenheimer’s world is literally rocked by the shockwaves of the reaction that has been set in motion.\n\nMost effective, however, is the use of sound and music. Like Jonathan Glazer’s upcoming The Zone of Interest, this is a film in which the horrors of war are not shown but conveyed inescapably through what we hear. Ludwig Göransson’s score is masterful and mercurial, surely one of the finest of the year. And there’s a recurring motif in the soundscape, a crescendo of thunderously stamping feet. It’s taken from a moment of triumph and glory, the high point of Oppenheimer’s career. But it takes on a mounting sense of threat with each use, as the catastrophic potential of the physicist’s work becomes clear."

        "text": "It’s a “Barbenheimer” world and we’re just living in it.\n\nThe collective force of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” continued to rule the box office in their second weekends of release, providing another needed jolt as two Hollywood strikes threaten the fragile exhibition industry.\n\nGreta Gerwig’s cotton candy-colored fantasy comedy again led the way, adding a massive $93 million between Friday and Sunday. Ticket sales for “Barbie” declined just 43% from its debut and resulted in the seventh-biggest second weekend in history. The only movies that enjoyed bigger sophomore outings were billion-dollar behemoths “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” ($149 million), “Avengers: Endgame” ($147 million) and “Infinity War” ($114 million), “Black Panther” ($111 million), “Jurassic World” ($106 million) and “The Avengers” ($103 million).\n\nChristopher Nolan’s dark historical drama also had a stellar sophomore outing, taking in a mighty $46.6 million over the weekend. According to Universal, it became the first R-rated film to gross more than $10 million for 10 days in a row.\n\n“Weekend two proves the outpouring of interest in ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ a week ago was not a fluke,” says Paul Dergarabedian, a senior Comscore analyst. “Both films put up second weekend numbers that would have been considered solid as debuts and reflect two of the best sophomore session holds in box office history.”\n\nAfter two weeks on the big screen, “Barbie” has generated $351.4 million in North America to stand as the fourth-biggest domestic release of the year. Globally, the Warner Bros. film has grossed $774 million and ranks as the third-largest film of 2023.\n\n“Oppenheimer,” meanwhile, has earned $174 million at the domestic box office and $400 million at the global box office. It has already outperformed the lifetime grosses of two prior Nolan efforts, “Tenet” ($365 million) and “Batman Begins” ($373 million).\n\nTwo new movies, Disney’s remake of “Haunted Mansion” and A24’s violent thriller “Talk to Me,” attempted to entice audiences in the wake of “Barbenheimer,” to varied results. (Of course, nobody could predict the dominant punch of the two blockbusters when release dates were set.)\n\n“Haunted Mansion” debuted in third place with $24.6 million from 3,700 North American theaters. The film added $9.1 million at the international box office, bringing its worldwide tally to $33 million. It’s not a great result for a kid-centric tentpole and it probably didn’t help that the Halloween-esque film opened in July. Disney spent $150 million to produce the film and tens of millions on promotional efforts. So, the film has a high bar to reach profitability, at least in its theatrical run.\n\nIt doesn’t bode well that audiences were mixed on “Haunted Mansion,” which has a “B+” CinemaScore. Directed by Justin Simien and starring LaKeith Stanfield, Rosario Dawson, Tiffany Haddish and Owen Wilson, the film takes inspiration from the Disney theme park ride and follows a single mother and her son, who move into… a haunted mansion.\n\n“Disney gets additional value from its productions for its other divisions — in this case, the film promotes its theme parks,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. “But setting that aside, the movie has a long climb to break-even.”\n\nThe low-budget “Talk to Me” generated a healthy $10 million from 2,340 theaters across the U.S. Those ticket sales exceeded expectations and were enough to land in sixth place. It’s the second-biggest start in wide release ever for A24, following “Hereditary” with $13.6 million.\n\n“Talk to Me” is the feature debut of Australian YouTube stars Danny and Michael Philippou. Reviews and word-of-mouth have been positive, which helped the film to break out at the box office. It centers on a group of friends who discovers how to conjure spirits, which is all fun and games until one of them unleashes a horrifying supernatural force.\n\n“This is an excellent opening for an indie horror picture made on a budget of $4.5 million,” says Gross. “The horror genre continues to be a very creative space for new and developing talent.”\n\nElsewhere at the domestic box office, the independent juggernaut “Sound of Freedom” added $13.6 million from 3,411 theaters in its fifth weekend of release. The thriller about child sex trafficking has generated $150 million to date, making it the 12th-highest grossing domestic release of the year. Remarkably, “Sound of Freedom” has earned more money in North America than big-budget tentpoles like “Fast X” ($145 million), Pixar’s “Elemental” ($142 million) and Tom Cruise’s “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” ($139 million).\n\n“Mission: Impossible” took the No. 5 spot on domestic charts with $10.7 million from 3,191 venues in its third outing. Internationally, the film has generated $309.4 million for a global total of $448 million. Despite positive reviews, the $291 million-budgeted blockbuster has stumbled in the wake of “Barbenheimer” and will struggle to recover in its theatrical run.\n\nOverall, the month of July was ahead by 1.4% compared to pre-pandemic times, while the entire box office for the year remains down roughly 20%.\n\n“July would have been a lukewarm month, but then ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ arrived; moviegoing exploded,” says Gross. “Within one week, July caught up to its pre-pandemic average.”"

        "text": "I'll admit I had my doubts when I first heard that director Christopher Nolan was planning to make a film about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who led the research effort to develop the first atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project. This is one of the most well-documented periods of 20th-century American history, after all, and there have already been so many books, films, and TV series about the race for the bomb, of varying quality. (As always, let me give a shout-out to Manhattan, a stellar fictional series that was tragically canceled after just two seasons.) How would Nolan make this very well-trodden material his own?\n\nI needn't have fretted. With Oppenheimer, Nolan has gifted us a truly unique, unflinching, nuanced portrait of the enigmatic, complicated man who spearheaded the Manhattan Project and subsequently ran afoul of the \"red-baiting\" politics of the McCarthy era. Technically it's a biopic, but it doesn't play like one. It's more like Nolan carefully selected various threads running through Oppenheimer's life and wove them into a richly textured tapestry that somehow transcends those raw materials. The result is pure visual poetry.\n\n(Spoilers below, although this is very well-documented history.)\n\nNolan's film is largely based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning 2005 biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin (which I highly recommend). The trailers understandably focused on the drama surrounding the birth of the atomic bomb leading up to the Trinity Test, but I had hoped that the film as a whole would follow the book's arc and include Oppenheimer's subsequent fall from grace. And so it does. In fact, that later, darker part of Oppenheimer's life provides the lens through which his earlier successes play out in Nolan's film.\n\nThere are two basic storylines, and the film shifts back and forth between them; Nolan has never been one to strictly adhere to a chronological timeline. \"Fission\" is shot in color and follows Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) through his early years as a graduate student and college professor; his leadership of the Manhattan Project culminating with the Trinity Test; his simultaneous triumph and torment in the wake of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; and the eventual loss of his security clearance thanks in large part to early Communist connections and his outspoken opposition to developing a hydrogen bomb.\n\n\"Fusion\" is shot in IMAX black-and-white analog photography and follows the 1959 Senate confirmation hearing of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), former chair of the Atomic Energy Commission who—as the film gradually reveals—played a critical role in stripping away Oppenheimer's security clearance five years earlier, angering many in the physics community. The black mark against Oppenheimer's name wasn't fully cleared until December 2022—right around the time the first trailer for Oppenheimer appeared.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNolan has assembled an amazing cast. David Krumholtz is almost unrecognizable as I.I. Rabi, and Benny Safdie is perfection as Edward Teller, who sharply disagrees with Oppenheimer about the hydrogen bomb and eventually betrays him during the security hearings. Emily Blunt shines in a relatively small role as Kitty Oppenheimer, who suffered from depression and had a volatile relationship with her philandering husband, but remained fiercely loyal to him. (She really did refuse to shake Teller's hand when Oppenheimer was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award in 1963.) But the film ultimately belongs to Murphy and Downey Jr., both of whom give Oscar-worthy performances. Their mutual antagonism is arguably the heart of the film.\n\nPhysics fans should have fun picking out the various physics luminaries who make brief cameos. Jack Quaid's Richard Feynman has few lines but is recognizable due to his bongos—an anachronism, since Feynman didn't take up the bongos until later in life, but an entertaining anachronism. Hey, there's Werner Heisenberg (Matthias Schweighöfer), Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh), Leo Szilard (Máté Haumann), Enrico Fermi (Danny Deferrari), Luis Alvarez (Alex Wolff), Hans Bethe (Gustaf Skarsgård), Vannevar Bush (Matthew Moline), Kenneth Bainbridge (Josh Peck), and the infamous Klaus Fuchs (Christopher Denham).\n\nNolan brings an impressive degree of historical accuracy to the film without resorting to a slavish recitation of facts, seeding it with oodles of throwaway details and characters as ornamental flourishes. For instance, the truth about whether a young Oppenheimer really injected cyanide into an apple intended for one of his professors (future Nobel Prize winning physicist Patrick Blackett) is hotly debated by historians, but it was not invented for the film. I was pleased to see mention of the paper Oppenheimer co-authored with a student while at Berkeley in 1939 predicting black holes—a topic largely forgotten until John Wheeler's work in the 1960s. Even his signature cocktail gets a shout-out.\n\nOppenheimer's mistress, Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), did commit suicide, and there is an assassination conspiracy theory that she was murdered and her suicide staged—something barely hinted at in the film, but present nonetheless. There was a certain amount of online shock at the nudity and sex scenes between Murphy and Pugh, but I thought they were carefully handled and weren't remotely gratuitous—especially the touching post-coital scene where the pair are simply sitting naked, having an intensely intimate conversation.\n\nPresident Truman did call Oppenheimer a \"crybaby\" (albeit not to his face) when the latter met with him after the war and confessed he felt he had blood on his hands. It's also true that Oppenheimer never publicly expressed regret for his role in building a bomb that killed between 100,000 and 200,000 people. (The exact number is still a matter of debate.) As he says in the film, his thinking was that it would be better to make dropping the first nuclear weapon so horrifying that nobody would ever want to use them again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dialogue during the openly hostile interrogation of Oppenheimer at the security hearings was drawn almost verbatim from the official transcripts—delivered to dramatic perfection by Nolan's outstanding cast. One of the most powerful scenes is the (verbatim) testimony of physicist David Hill (Rami Malek) during Strauss' Senate confirmation hearing to be Eisenhower's Secretary of Commerce.\n\nStrauss had hoped Hill, then chair of the Federation of American Scientists, would speak in his favor. Instead, Hill declared that \"most of the scientists in this country would prefer to see Mr. Strauss completely out of the Government,\" and went on to provide a devastating critique of Strauss, citing his arrogance, lack of integrity, and personal vindictiveness toward Oppenheimer in particular. (Nolan dug up the transcript himself from Senate records.) Strauss was not confirmed—the first failure of a Cabinet nomination since 1925—and the rejection effectively ended his political career. He remained bitter about that for the rest of his life. Some might call it karma.\n\nThat said, this is not a documentary, and naturally a few liberties were taken. Most notably, the powerful final conversation between Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), referencing a conversation they'd had in the past, is entirely fictional. Nor is the actual physics front and center, since thematically, Nolan is far more interested in exploring questions of power, politics, patriotism, and personal internal paradoxes. Still, the film handily captures the world of physics and physicists. Case in point: in one scene, Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) questions Oppenheimer about the possible risk of igniting the atmosphere and destroying the world when they push the detonator button for the Trinity Test. \"Chances are near zero,\" Oppie responds. \"What do you want from theory alone?\" Groves responds, \"Zero would be nice.\"\n\nThose less familiar with this period in history might not pick up on all the ornamental details, but that shouldn't hamper their enjoyment of the film. Ars Senior Technology Editor Lee Hutchinson had quibbles with the sound quality, however, citing \"mumbling, background noise obscuring the dialog, and putting VFX behind dialog so the sound overpowered everything else.\" That wasn't the case at the screening I attended (or at least, I didn't notice). Still, forewarned is forearmed, and there was also criticism about the sound mixing for Nolan's 2020 film, Tenet. Audiophiles, take note.\n\nClocking in at three hours' running time, with many scenes featuring a bunch of white men sitting around talking about physics and defense strategy, Oppenheimer is the antithesis of what is usually deemed summer fare. Yet Nolan's skill in telling the story is such that it never seems to drag. Small wonder audiences have been flocking to theaters to see the film. (Many made it a double feature with Barbie, hence the \"Barbenheimer\" phenomenon.) Oppenheimer greatly exceeded its initial box office projections and has already grossed over $400 million worldwide. It's my pick for best film of 2023 thus far, and a worthy addition to my growing list of films about the atomic bomb.\n\nOppenheimer is now playing in theaters."

        "text": "Films about Great Men are usually acts of hagiography, and in many ways, Oppenheimer is no different. Christopher Nolan’s biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer, “the father of the atomic bomb”, is invested in Oppenheimer as a once-in-a-generation genius, a Great Man who literally moved the earth, but Nolan is also interested in all of Oppenheimer’s failures and foibles. And I do mean ALL of them, at a monster 180 minutes, Oppenheimer wades through the tides of Oppenheimer’s life if not at a leisurely pace, then certainly at a thorough one. We learn that “Oppy” is brilliant at theoretical physics but bad at math and a liability in the lab, he’s a womanizer, a bad dad and worse husband, and a big enough believer in his own importance to underestimate his own political liabilities.\n\nCillian Murphy plays Oppenheimer with a bright-eyed intensity and steely fortitude in turns, as he portrays the man from his student days in Europe to his post-war downfall. Nolan divides his film into three sections, one centered on a post-war hearing to renew, or not, Oppenheimer’s government security clearance; another focused on his days heading the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, New Mexico; and the final section, told in black and white, from the perspective of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.) during his own senate confirmation hearing to join Eisenhower’s cabinet.\n\nOppenheimer is a big film, not just in minutes but in scope of story and scale of ambition. It covers decades and monumental moments in history, but also makes room for more personal moments, such as Oppenheimer’s disastrous affair with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), a gifted but troubled psychiatrist and Communist activist. Nolan, working from Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s epic biography, American Prometheus, is interested in the contrast of Oppenheimer the Great Man and Oppenheimer the Lousy Asshole, though there is enough sympathy for Oppenheimer the Guy Who Changed His Mind Later that even Oppenheimer’s worst traits are a little rose-colored.\n\nWhich parts of Oppenheimer appeal the most is entirely personal. I responded most to the later portion of the film focused on Lewis Strauss’s confirmation hearing. Oppenheimer isn’t even in this portion of the film, he only appears in black and white flashbacks as Strauss recalls their fraught history to a young senate aide (Alden Ehrenreich, absolutely stealing the show). Strauss personally recruited Oppenheimer to Princeton University, but after seeing Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) in conversation, and then being ignored by Einstein, he takes a strong dislike to Oppenheimer, believing the other man turned Einstein against him.\n\nNolan, one of the most exacting filmmakers working today, recreates Los Alamos in painstaking detail (with production design by Ruth De Jong and set decoration by Claire Kaufman, Olivia Peebles, and Adam Willis), and re-stages the Trinity Test—minus the nuclear material—to its fullest effect. It is terrible, it is monstrous, it is awesome in the Biblical sense of the word—it is not more horrifying than even one single image of the real devastation visited upon Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nThe Manhattan Project portion of the film offers a lot of interesting stuff, from the recreated Trinity Test to Oppenheimer’s hideous home life—set to a soundtrack of screaming babies and his wife’s functional alcoholism—to Matt Damon’s reliably charming performance as the Army general tasked with keeping all these half-Commie scientists in line during the war. There is also a lot of time devoted to Oppenheimer sowing the seeds of his own destruction, as he dabbles in left-wing politics—mostly harmless before the war, but utterly devastating during the Red Scare that comes after. As smart as he is, Oppenheimer truly cannot read the room, whether it’s attending socialist rallies at the wrong moment or inadvertently betraying a friend as a possible spy.\n\nBut this portion of the film is also the most rote biopic stuff in Oppenheimer. It’s very well crafted and extremely well-acted, and it’s not exactly boring, it’s just that it doesn’t top a single line delivered during the “senate hearing” portion of the film. Oppenheimer’s security clearance hearing at least has a truly great scene with Emily Blunt as Kitty, Oppenheimer’s long-suffering wife, a talented scientist in her own right relegated to the kitchen by The Times. That scene crackles with Kitty’s repressed fury—at her husband, at the men undermining him, at the world undermining her—and comes closest to the stellar line from the senate hearing.\n\nThat line, though, it just overshadows everything, even the big bomb drop. “Did you ever stop to think,” the disillusioned aide says to Strauss, “that they didn’t talk about you at all? That they had more important things to talk about?” A lesser actor than Alden Ehrenreich would make a meal out of that line, but he delivers it with devastating casualness, as if it’s so obvious a thought it isn’t even worth the breath it takes to utter it. In truth, no one knows what Oppenheimer and Einstein talked about that day at Princeton, but Lewis Strauss built his reality around the idea that it was him. How silly of him! How asinine!\n\nAt its best, Oppenheimer is not a Great Man biopic, it’s not a technical marvel of filmmaking, it’s not a cracking thriller about the race to end World War II, and it’s definitely not a meditation on the consequences of using nuclear weapons. At its best, Oppenheimer is a story about small, petty men changing the world for the worse because they cannot fathom that THEY are not the center of it. It’s a cautionary tale less about nuclear power and more about the deleterious effect of self-important men on those around them. Oppenheimer dismisses Einstein as the best mind of his generation, past his prime and no longer on the cutting edge, but Einstein is, in fact, old enough to know that it’s not about him, a lesson literally no other man in this film learns until it’s too late.\n\nOppenheimer is good enough, and long enough, that everyone will have a different favorite part, though I suspect what will linger longest is not the history lesson, or the cinematic gee-whizzery, but the look on Strauss’s face when someone points out that maybe he wasn’t the main character all along. Sometimes, a person comes along and can change the world as J. Robert Oppenheimer did, ushering in the nuclear age. But always there are those men like Lewis Strauss, manipulating people and events to satisfy their vindicative agendas made up of imagined slights. We only have to cope with a transformative genius like Oppenheimer occasionally—and sometimes they even improve the world, with art and music and beauty—but we always have to navigate the detritus of the aggrieved egos of men like Strauss. Oppenheimer is about genius, about a man, about a bomb, but it’s also about the waste laid to the world by weak men.\n\nThis review was published during the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes of 2023. The work being reviewed would not exist without the labor of writers and actors. Oppenheimer is exclusively in theaters from July 21, 2023.\n\nAttached - Matt Damon arriving at JFK with his family after wrapping Oppenheimer promotion due to the strike."

        "text": "UPDATED: It’s still a Barbie world this weekend as the Greta Gerwig-directed charmer reached a global cume of $1.184B. Last session, Margot Robbie’s living doll crossed the $1B threshold, and in this 4th frame added $45.1M in 75 offshore markets (a 47% dip) to bring the international box office cume to $657.6M.\n\nOverall, this was mostly a holdover weekend offshore for the studios with the only major new release being Sony’s Gran Turismo: Based on a True Story in a staggered pattern. Local China pic No More Bets also upped the ante in that market while India saw a handful of new releases propel it to a record-breaking weekend – see more below.\n\nTurning back to Warner Bros’ Barbie, as we’ve reported, it is the highest-grossing live-action movie from a female director worldwide. It is also WB’s 2nd biggest film ever, overtaking Aquaman globally.\n\nInternationally, Barbie has entered the Top 10 list of WB’s biggest movies ever at No. 8 and surpassing The Dark Knight Rises. It’s the No. 1 U.S. movie of the year in 25 markets including Italy, the UK, Poland, Brazil and Australia; and the biggest WB title ever in 21, including the UK (where it has crossed $100M to overtake Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2), Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina and Poland.\n\nThe UAE opened this weekend with $1.9M for Barbie’s 5th best score of the session. The result is 71% above Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, 41% over Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 and higher than Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania by 34%.\n\nSaudi Arabia had a strong opening at at No. 1 with $1.8M, ahead of Indy 5 by 262%, Guardians 3 by 161%, Quantumania by 117%, Avatar: The Way of Water by 37% and Jurassic World Dominion by 33%.\n\nJapan’s opening was $1.4M on 650 screens with scores from Eiga and Filmarks at 3.5 and 3.8 out of 5, respectively. Results are roughly on par with Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again and Sex and the City.\n\nThe Top 5 Barbie markets to date are the UK $101.1M, Mexico ($51.8M), Australia ($47.3M), Germany ($42.2M) and Brazil ($42M).\n\nClose on Barbie’s heels and also from Warner Bros, Meg 2: The Trench in its sophomore session grossed another $43.7M in 75 offshore markets. That lifts international to $202.8M with the worldwide running total now at $256.9M.\n\nIn China, where China Media Capital releases, the big shark pic has reached $90.2M, landing in 3rd place this weekend amid strong competition. Maoyan is projecting a $123M finish for the co-production.\n\nBehind China, Mexico ($15M), UK ($9.7M), France ($7.6M) and Spain ($7.4M) round out the Top 5. Korea opens on Tuesday followed by Japan on August 25.\n\nUniversal and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer saw a 43% drop in its fourth weekend with another $32M from 79 markets. The international box office cume is now $384.8M as it sits at $649M through Sunday.\n\nThe overseas cume to date is above The Dark Knight Rises and more than double Dunkirk, Interstellar, Inception and Tenet at the same point of release.\n\nThis is now Nolan’s biggest film of all time in 50 markets including Germany, Brazil, Netherlands India and Poland. It’s his top non-superhero movie in a total 62.\n\nVietnam was new this session with a $443K debut, above Tenet, The Dark Knight Rises and more than double Dunkirk excluding previews. By Saturday, it had already surpassed the lifetime of Interstellar and delivered the biggest opening Friday and Saturday for a Nolan film, and the highest IMAX Friday and Saturday share of all time.\n\nAlso notable, in the UK the Cillian Murphy-led drama overtook Star Wars: The Last Jedi on Friday to become the 3rd biggest IMAX release of all time. And, in Brazil, Oppenheimer topped the lifetime of The Dark Knight Rises.\n\nThe global IMAX cume is $134M including $58.7M from offshore screens – the 4th biggest title ever in the format in like-for-like markets. In 11 markets, it’s the best IMAX performance ever including Mexico and India.\n\nThe Top 5 overall markets are the UK ($58.1M), Germany ($35.4M), France ($28M), Australia ($21M) and India ($17.7M).\n\nKorea opens this Tuesday which is a holiday, followed by Italy and China later in August.\n\nMeanwhile, Paramount’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One has topped $500M globally with $522.5M through Sunday. This weekend, Tom Cruise drew another $10.9M worth of business in 67 overseas markets, down 39% from last session, for a running offshore total of $362.9M.\n\nThe 4th weekend in Japan had a fantastic hold as the Obon holiday kicked off and saw the actioner jump 25% versus last week, ranking No. 1. The cume there is $26.6M.\n\nChina is still the biggest overall market with $48.2M, followed by the UK and Korea, both at $31.2M, Japan ($26.6M) and France ($21.9M).\n\nSony’s Gran Turismo: Based on a True Story got off the starting block overseas ahead of domestic (where the pic is previewing before its official August 25 release), revving the engines to $10.7M from 30 markets. Majors in the first suite include France, the UK, Australia, Germany and Spain. France led all play at $2.3M, followed by the UK ($1.3M) and $1M a piece for Australia and Germany and $900K in Spain.\n\nSony got things going on the PlayStation game adaptation from director Neill Blomkamp at Cannes in May, taking over the Carlton pier’s billboard and hosting a photo call towards the end of the fest. Stars David Harbour and Orlando Bloom had earlier shown off a first look during CinemaCon in April.\n\nIt’s early days, but the hope here is that word of mouth drives performance. The movie is currently carrying a 57% from critics on Rotten Tomatoes but is much higher with audiences at 97%. In Germany, exits are at 4.5 stars while France’s AlloCiné has it at a 2.5 from critics but 4.2 from audiences.\n\nKey markets still to come are Brazil and Mexico on August 24, followed by China on September 1, Japan on September 15 and Italy and Korea on September 20.\n\nParamount’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem in its sophomore frame added $10.4M from 47 markets. Internationally, the heroes on the half-shell have grossed $21.9M to date for $94.7M global with several major markets still to release.\n\nNew this session, Mexico debuted at No. 2 with $2.9M, followed by France at $1.8M. In China, the start was a No. 8 $885K amid strong local competition. The UK leads play with $7.2M.\n\nDisney/Pixar’s Elemental fired up a 42% drop from last session overseas. After nine weekends in play, the international total is $293.4M for $443.6M global. This weekend added $8.9M from 51 markets. There was a 6% bump in Japan where the gross is now $7.2M.\n\nKorea is still tops at $50.4M, followed by Mexico ($20.5M), France ($19.9M), the UK ($19.6M) and China ($15.9M).\n\nIn China, Super Lion’s crime drama No More Bets from director Ao Shen has grossed RMB 1.76B+ ($244M) on its way to a Maoyan projected finish of RMB 3.7B ($511M). The weekend was approximately RMB 720M ($99.5M) in first place. In IMAX, it grossed $6M locally. Maoyan’s Creation of the Gods: Kingdom of Storms also continues to perform, now having reached RMB 2.01B ($278M), including $28M from IMAX in China.\n\nLed by Rajinikanth-starrer Jailer and Anil Sharma’s Gadar 2, India‘s August 11-13 frame was the busiest single weekend since the beginning of the pandemic and set a new all-time theatrical gross record for the biggest combined weekend in history at more than 390 crore ($47M).\n\nIn Korea, new opener Concrete Utopia got off to a strong start with $11.4M while crime pic Smugglers is now at an outstanding $31.6M.\n\nMISC UPDATED CUMES/NOTABLE\n\nHaunted Mansion (DIS): $3M intl weekend (45 markets); $22.7M intl cume/$75.6M global\n\nTransformers: Rise of the Beasts (PAR): $1.6M intl weekend (25 markets); $279.6M intl cume/$436.7M global\n\nInsidious: The Red Door (SNY): $1M intl weekend (58 markets); $104.2M intl cume/$185.8M global\n\nAsteroid City (UNI): $726K intl weekend (46 markets); $20.4M intl cume/$48.3M global"

        "text": "More than 200,000 people sat for nearly five hours with nothing but the artificial light of the screen casting shadows over their awed faces this past weekend as the cultural phenomenon “Barbenheimer” swept the nation.\n\nPart of what drove the “Barbenheimer” double-feature craze is the hyper feminine-masculine dichotomy between the films, as “Barbie” was advertised as a feminist paradise while viewers assumed “Oppenheimer,” a biopic about the man who led the creation of the atomic bomb, would tackle war and corruption. Ahead of the films’ opening, online consensus favored watching “Oppenheimer” first then ending the day with “Barbie” under the assumption that the former would be incredibly depressing and audiences would need an uplifting only the latter could provide. But in true GW fashion, this Barbie decided to be a devil’s advocate and watched director Greta Gerwig’s masterpiece first.\n\nIn “Barbie,” viewers are quickly introduced to Margot Robbie’s Stereotypical Barbie as she makes the rounds in Barbieland, a matriarchal utopia, from an all-Barbie Supreme Court and a Pink House for the president, while the Kens … are sort of in charge of the beach. After a long day of observing physicist Barbie win a Nobel Prize (score one for the Barbies over J. Robert Oppenheimer) and moderating a fight between Ryan Gosling’s needy Stereotypical Ken and Simu Liu’s Lifeguard Ken, she brings a choreographed, blowout dance party to a halt, asking: “Do you guys ever think about dying?”\n\nThe literal record-scratch moment sparks the plot of the film as the next day Barbie’s fantasy world crumbles, sending her to seek sage advice from Kate McKinnon’s Weird Barbie. She discovers the girl playing with her in the Real World is negatively influencing her life and journeys to heal her human counterpart.\n\nIn a desperate attempt for her affection, Gosling’s Ken tags along for the ride. Barbie and Ken get separated through their misadventures, giving Ken the opportunity to discover patriarchy and import it back to Barbieland, creating a host of problems that the Barbies must solve. Along the way, Barbie teams up with mother-daughter pair Gloria and Sasha, the humans responsible for her existential crisis.\n\nAfter initially hearing about this film, many people wrote it off as fluff to promote Mattel’s brand. Instead, “Barbie” unexpectedly goes where many blockbusters before it haven’t, by catering to a predominantly female audience through its satirizing of the patriarchy and gender dynamics. From the hard cut showing an ad for Depression Barbie, a doll that wears sweatpants all day and rewatches the BBC’s “Pride and Prejudice” show until she passes out, to the Barbies experiencing the canon event of pretending to enjoy a man playing guitar, the comedy was meant for the girls.\n\nThe peppy acting of the ensemble cast, featuring stars from Issa Rae to Michael Cera, is true to the dolls they portray. Yet Robbie still delivers a heartfelt performance alongside her creator, Ruth Handler, in which Barbie unpacks an identity crisis while Ruth, played by Rhea Perlman, praises her for evolving. The film resolves with an ending that is beyond “Kenough” but you’ll have to see for yourself.\n\nChristopher Nolan’s adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,” chronicles the father of the atomic bomb’s conflicted morals and personal woes as he worked on the Manhattan Project, and pinpoints his career’s downfall through two government hearings. An early scene in which Oppenheimer, played by Cillian Murphy, attempts to poison his teacher, goes through a crisis of conscience, and then thwarts the professor from dying foreshadows a shocking amount of the film.\n\nPolitics and quantum physics go hand in hand as Oppenheimer initially struggles to get security clearance due to his ties to members of the Communist Party. Few actors encapsulate pain and regret like Murphy as he stares off into space during a Red Scare-sparked hearing into his communist associations, which unfortunately eats up valuable time in the film as the hearings are endless.\n\nThe race to build the weapon of mass destruction leads Oppenheimer to assemble a team of renowned scientists and convene them for three years in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Though I failed my AP Physics exam, I found the scenes in which Oppenheimer debates with his fellow scientists how to construct the bomb to be among the most engaging in the movie — in part because of the bizarre ensemble of actors Nolan assembled. During the infamous Trinity test, none other than Josh Peck — yes, a man who once ran over Oprah in a Nickelodeon show — turns the key that unleashes a bomb.\n\nBut Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt, who were limited in screen time likely because of the unnecessarily extensive time Nolan devoted to the hearings, still shined. Pugh in the role of Jean Tatlock, Oppenheimer’s ex-flame, captures an intense torturedness in her vulnerable interactions with him, especially when he reveals to her his engagement. Blunt, who plays Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty, expertly shifts from quiet despair after being made aware of his affair to firecracker as she defends him during a security hearing.\n\nAll of that said, no movie should be three hours long. In an effort to stay true to history, Nolan drilled too deep into the legal and national security implications of Oppenheimer’s loss of clearance, misplacing the actual plot: Oppenheimer’s late-arriving conscience and subsequent moral crisis. In an effort to build tension, the complex governmental hearings just dragged on as Nolan brought back too many acquaintances and enemies of Oppenheimer to make their cases.\n\nAfter participating in this fever dream of head-to-toe pink outfits and a frenzy of film bros, I can confidently say seeing these films back to back is a mistake. Some might argue that I just watched them in the wrong order but “Barbie” genuinely was not all party, more a meditation on girl and womanhood, and in truth, no movie or TV show can overpower “Oppenheimer.” Believe me, I tried watching “Glee” afterward.\n\nThese films each deserve a full day and a clear mind to be appreciated, from the fantastic floor-to-ceiling plastic sets of “Barbie” to the multi-layered, fraught emotions of “Oppenheimer.”"

        "text": "Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer.\n\nA disturbing detail in Oppenheimer seems to hint at a larger conspiracy... and it sees director Christopher Nolan in true \"horror mode.\"\n\nDuring a harrowing sequence of quick shots, the death of Jean Tatlock is shown as she seemingly drowns herself in the bath. However, a pair of black-gloved hands hints that all is not as it seems.\n\n“One thing in Oppenheimer I haven't been able to get out of my head is that brief insert of black gloves in that one flashback with Florence Pugh,” said film fan Josh Lewis on Twitter. “Nolan was really in his horror mode.”\n\nOne thing in Oppenheimer I haven't been able to get out of my head is that brief insert of black gloves in that one flashback with Florence Pugh. Nolan was really in his horror mode. — Josh Lewis (@thejoshl) July 23, 2023\n\nHe’s not the first to notice the gloved hands, and the scene seems to suggest that Tatlock’s death wasn’t suicide at all. Tatlock is played by Florence Pugh and features throughout the movie as Oppenheimer’s lover who continued to have a relationship with the scientist while he was married to his wife, Kitty (played by Emily Blunt).\n\nNot only frowned upon due to the illicit nature of their relationship, Tatlock was also a keen member of the Communist party and was seen by many to be a security risk. Tatlock’s fate is teased throughout the film, with a flashback eventually revealing she supposedly drowned herself in the bathtub.\n\nOf course, the gloved hands suggest otherwise, and fans have since been debating its meaning. Some believe the scene is a manifestation of Oppenheimer’s guilt and the gloved hands are meant to represent Oppenheimer blaming himself for her death.\n\nThe horrifying blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment is the closest Nolan comes to horror in Oppenheimer. However, it also teases a decades-old conspiracy. Following her death, an autopsy determined her cause of death as death by drowning, however, a “faint trace” of chloral hydrate was found in her system, a substance capable of sedating a person.\n\nAccording to the book American Prometheus, on which Oppenheimer is based, at least one physician had doubts about her cause of death, speculating she may have been drugged and forcibly drowned. “If you were clever and wanted to kill someone, this is the way to do it,” said one doctor.\n\nThis subsequently led to speculation by historians, as well as Tatlock’s own brother, that she may have been killed by U.S. Government officials due to her affiliation to the Communist party, coupled with her closeness to one of the Manhattan Project’s key players.\n\n“I do not believe that her interests were really political,” Oppenheimer told The United States Atomic Energy Commission in 1954. “She was a person of deep religious feeling. She loved this country, its people, and its life.”\n\nNevertheless, it looks as though Oppenheimer director Christopher Nolan may have been convinced enough to tease that her death wasn’t a suicide at all.\n\nIGN’s Oppenheimer review gave it 10/10 and said: “A biopic in constant free fall, Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan’s most abstract yet most exacting work, with themes of guilt writ large through apocalyptic IMAX nightmares that grow both more enormous and more intimate as time ticks on. A disturbing, mesmerizing vision of what humanity is capable of bringing upon itself, both through its innovation, and through its capacity to justify any atrocity.”\n\nWant to read more about Oppenheimer?

        "text": "The area of southern New Mexico where the Trinity test occurred was not, contrary to the popular account, an uninhabited, desolate expanse of land. There were more than 13,000 New Mexicans living within a 50-mile radius. Many of those children, women and men were not warned before or after the test. Eyewitnesses have told me they believed they were experiencing the end of the world. They didn’t reflect on the Bhagavad Gita, as Oppenheimer said he did. Many simply dropped to their knees and recited the Hail Mary in Spanish.\n\nFor days after, they said, ash fell from the sky, contaminated with 10 pounds of plutonium. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that after the test, radiation levels near some homes in the area reached “almost 10,000 times what is currently allowed in public areas.”\n\nThat fallout has had devastating health consequences. While I know of no people who lost their lives during the test, the organization I co-founded has documented many instances of families in New Mexico with four and five generations of cancers since the bomb was detonated. My family is typical: I am the fourth generation in my family to have had cancer since 1945. My 23-year-old niece has just been diagnosed with thyroid cancer. She is a college student studying art. Now her life, too, has been upended.\n\nDespite this, New Mexicans who may have been exposed to radioactive fallout from Trinity have never been eligible for compensation under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a 1990 federal law that has provided billions of dollars to people exposed during subsequent tests on U.S. soil or during uranium mining.\n\n“Oppenheimer” leaves out other stories, too. The Manhattan Project and the nuclear weapons industry used the promise of a better life to entice thousands of people in the Southwest into the uranium mines that supplied the Manhattan Project. The miners went to work each day without adequate safety gear, while supervisors wore it from head to toe. Miners seldom left the mines during their shifts, even to eat lunch. They drank the contaminated water inside the mines when they were allowed to take breaks."

As with Nolan’s movie, the show followed his role in developing the world’s first nuclear weapons and his rivalry with Edward Teller, through to being stripped of his security clearance by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission in the 1950s. David Suchet, Kate Harper, John Carson, Christopher Munke and Jana Shelden also starred.\n\nThe show catapulted Waterston to fame, as he went on to land roles in Law and Order, The Newsroom, and Grace & Frankie. It aired in the U.S. on PBS’ American Playhouse and won three BAFTAs including Best Drama Series, while being nominated for seven.\n\nThe BBC’s move comes as Oppenheimer tears up the global box office alongside Barbie.

        "text": "For two years of my time as a student at the University of Chicago, my dorm building, my cafeteria, and the library where I worked all stood on the same block as the site of the world's first-ever manmade nuclear reactor.\n\nUpon first glance, you wouldn't really know just how much this stretch of land in Chicago's Hyde Park shaped the Atomic Age. Between the hustle and bustle of students, you might be more distracted by the crayon-bright colors of the Max Palevsky dorms, the imposing brutalist architecture of the Regenstein Library, or even the glass dome of the Mansueto Library. Look past those, however, and you'll see a bronze statue by Henry Moore, titled \"Nuclear Energy,\" commemorating the construction of the reactor — and the moment in 1942 when it went critical.\n\nThat same nuclear reactor makes an ever-so-brief appearance in Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, when physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) journeys to Chicago to check out his Manhattan Project colleagues' progress. He encounters physicists like Enrico Fermi (Danny Deferrari) and Leo Szilard (Máté Haumann), who confirm that they have successfully engineered the first manmade nuclear reaction. How did they do it? With Chicago Pile-1, or CP-1: a reactor made of bricks of graphite, built under a football field on an active college campus.\n\nThe scene barely takes up any time in the three-hour-long epic that is Oppenheimer, but the science behind it is crucial to the creation of the atomic bomb. Not only that, but the construction of CP-1 is fascinating enough that it could easily be its own movie. How did it work? Did it leave any radiation on the UChicago campus? And perhaps most strangely of all, why was it built under a football field?\n\nWhat is CP-1, and why was it important to the Manhattan Project?\n\nA painting of Enrico Fermi and his colleagues overseeing construction of Chicago Pile-1. Credit: Fotosearch/Getty Images\n\nAs the Manhattan Project got underway, several things became apparent. First, scientists had to determine whether controlling a nuclear chain reaction was even possible.\n\nThe principle of a chain reaction was already well understood by this point. \"If very heavy nuclei — in this case uranium — absorb a neutron, they will fission, and they will break into pieces and give up a certain amount of energy so that the nuclei fly off and everything gets hotter,\" Peter Littlewood, Chair of the UChicago Department of Physics, explained to Mashable in a phone interview. \"For every nucleus that fissures, you generate three extra neutrons. And if these neutrons get captured by another, then you get nine and you keep on building. That's what we call a chain reaction.\"\n\nOn top of figuring out how to control such a reaction, the scientists also needed enough fissile material, such as plutonium or uranium, to place in the test bomb, as well as the bombs that the U.S. government would go on to drop over Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nEnter CP-1. In November of 1942, Fermi and other members of the UChicago's Metallurgical Laboratory — which studied plutonium — constructed CP-1 on a squash court under the west football stands of the University's Stagg Field. Stagg was once host to UChicago's football team. However, Fermi and colleagues didn't have to worry about interfering with football games or practice given that University President Robert Maynard Hutchins had ended the fairly dominant varsity football program in 1939.\n\n\"I think it is a good thing for the country to have one important university discontinue football,\" Hutchins told students in a 1940 address. \"There is no doubt that, on the whole, the game has been a major handicap to education in the United States.\" (The sport returned in 1969, although by then, the old Stagg Field had been replaced by the Regenstein Library.)\n\nThanks to UChicago's sudden aversion to athletics, construction on CP-1 continued until December 2, 1942, when the reactor produced the first manmade, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. With the knowledge that such a a reaction was possible, construction began on a nuclear reactor in Hanford, Washington, where plutonium production for the Trinity Test bomb and the bomb dropped over Nagasaki took place. CP-1 itself was not responsible for any of the plutonium production.\n\n\"CP-1 was designed as an experiment. It wasn't designed to do anything other than prove that the principle worked,\" Peter Littlewood, Chair of the UChicago Department of Physics, told Mashable in a phone interview. \"But they were so confident that it worked that they had already designed the Hanford reactor before the experiment was completed.\" Construction on Hanford only took 18 months.\n\nHow did CP-1 work?\n\nCP-1, according to \"Oppenheimer.\" Credit: Screenshot: Universal Pictures\n\nFermi himself described CP-1 as \"a crude pile of black bricks and wooden timbers.\" So how did such a \"crude\" structure, 20 feet wide and 25 feet tall, create a monumental chain reaction?\n\nOn top of the graphite blocks, CP-1 also contained smaller pellets of uranium, which would help initiate the chain reaction in the first place. The graphite served as a \"moderator\" for the reaction. \"It slows down neutrons and makes them more easy to absorb by uranium atoms,\" Littlewood explained in an e-mail.\n\nBut the ultimate form of control came in the form of long wooden rods coated in cadmium, which absorbed the neutrons. \"When the control rods are all pushed in, nothing happens,\" said Littlewood. \"Then you withdraw the control rods, and every time you do that, there's a little burst of energy.\" Fermi and his team monitored these bursts of energy, watching the power build up and calculating how far to pull the control rods out until the energy was self-sustaining.\n\nWere the CP-1 experiments safe?\n\nLet's take a field trip to a nuclear reactor...under a football field. Credit: Screenshot: Universal Pictures\n\nUpon learning that I was spending a large chunk of my time at UChicago hanging out around the site of an old nuclear reactor, I was mildly alarmed. Would I graduate from school with an extra head?\n\nOn the one hand, every tour group passing the Moore statue gets assured that the site is not a radioactive hazard. On the other hand, an old professor of mine once told my class a rumor that the café in the Regenstein Library had been moved from the basement to the first floor due to traces of radiation found in the basement. (To put it in perspective: I and many other UChicago students have spent more time in that library basement than Cillian Murphy does staring right into the camera in Oppenheimer.)\n\nLuckily, Littlewood assured me that that wasn't the case. \"I have heard that rumor, but not really from a reputable source, so I don't buy it.\"\n\nHe continued: \"The other thing is that radiation is everywhere, and it's very easy to find. Could there have been some radioactive contamination that was permanent? It would depend on how well they cleaned up the fissile material or what they did with it. At the time, and certainly later in the Cold War, we were extraordinarily lax in taking care of radioactive material... But the amount of radiation which was created by CP-1 would probably have been quite tiny.\" Graphite could also have absorbed some of the radiation, acting as protection in a setting that otherwise lacked shielding.\n\nAdding to these assurances? In a 2019 NPR story, UChicago's radiation safety officer James Marsicek used a Geiger counter to measure the radiation around what used to be Stagg Field. The counter consistently measured .02 millirems per hour, simply picking up the background radiation that naturally occurs around us.\n\nNone of this is information that you'll get in Oppenheimer — a film already filled to the brim with decades' worth of science — but it's crucial to understand just how much effort went into the Manhattan Project. One quick glimpse of CP-1 in the movie hides stories of abandoned football fields, hastily constructed power plants, and even worries (now soothed) about radioactive libraries. But Littlewood is quick to point out that CP-1's role in the Manhattan Project is only part of its impact.\n\nWhen CP-1 went critical, Littlewood said that \"it became clear, at that point, that you could use nuclear power to generate energy. Following the war, there was work from the government to do that. That involved setting up what became Argonne National Lab, which is about 25 miles southwest of the city. Argonne National Lab was the place which designed and built the first set of nuclear reactors and formed the prototypes of things which have spread around the world. So it's very much a case of swords into plowshares.\"\n\nAs for the UChicago Physics Department's thoughts on Oppenheimer? \"We're physicists, so we're not used to getting excited,\" Littlewood said. \"I'm sure we'll probably do a private screening of it at some point for our students.\n\nOppenheimer is now in theaters."

The cast members, for their part, have been on a media tour de force full of effusive praise and affection for each other.\n\nHere's a sampling of cast members gushing about Cillian Murphy:\n\n\"I have never witnessed a greater sacrifice by a lead actor in my career,\" Robert Downey Jr. said of his costar Cillian Murphy in a People Magazine story published Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmily Blunt, who plays the wife of Murphy's character in the movie, said she was wowed by the extreme diet Murphy underwent to resemble J. Robert Oppenheimer.\n\n\"He had such a monumental undertaking. And he could only eat, like, an almond every day. He was so emaciated,\" Blunt told Extra in an interview that aired July 7.\n\nBlunt and Matt Damon have also talked about losing themselves in Murphy's piercing blue eyes while shooting.\n\n\"It's a real problem when you're doing scene work with Cillian,\" Damon told People Magazine in a story published Friday. \"Sometimes you find yourself just swimming in his eyes.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's like that 'Ocean Eyes' song by Billie Eilish. We just hum it all day,\" Blunt said in the same interview.\n\nHere's Murphy on Downey Jr.:\n\n\"I mean, acting with him was just extraordinary,\" Murphy told GQ magazine in a story published Monday. \"He's just electrifying, the most available, engaged, present, unpredictably brilliant actor I've ever worked with.\"\n\nMurphy on Florence Pugh:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPugh and Murphy share a sex scene in the movie, something the film's director, Christopher Nolan, had never done before in his filmography.\n\n\"And I think when you see it, it's so fucking powerful. And they're not gratuitous. They're perfect. And Florence is just amazing,\" Murphy said of Pugh in an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, published July 19.\n\n\"She has this presence as a person and on screen that is staggering. The impact she has for the size of the role, it's quite devastating,\" Murphy said.\n\nA-list marketing\n\nWhile gushy media tours aren't new — \"A Star is Born,\" anyone? — this one stands out first because of the sheer quantity of comments and the competition it's up against.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI'm talking, of course, about the marketing behemoth that is Greta Gerwig's \"Barbie.\" \"Barbie\" has been widely promoted with everything from Barbie-themed Xbox controllers to burgers numbering among the movie's many wall-to-wall marketing plays.\n\nIn fact, \"Barbie\" had a $150 million marketing budget, per Variety. That's bigger than the estimated $100 million it cost to make \"Oppenheimer.\"\n\nWith competition like that, \"Oppenheimer\" needed to muster every ounce of marketing magic it had. Having the very famous and talented cast publicly declare their admiration for one another is a low-cost but effective way to promote \"Oppenheimer.\"\n\nAnd it looks like it's working. According to Deadline, the movie clocked the highest global day and date opening weekend ever for a biopic. \"Oppenheimer\" also bested \"John Wick: Chapter 4\" by netting the biggest opening weekend for an R-rated film in 2023, per Screen Rant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNolan may just want to reunite this cast for his next cinematic masterpiece."

But where he came from and where he had been educated had nothing to do with it. (He had been born in Albany — although he grew up on one Army post after another, as the family trailed his military-chaplain father — and graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point.)\n\n“It was Groves who decided that the first location of this project would be Manhattan — ‘We’ll park it there for the time being,’” said Robert Norris, a historian of the atomic age and the author of “The Manhattan Project” (2007).\n\nThe first headquarters were in an office building across from City Hall Park in Lower Manhattan where the Corps of Engineers already had an outpost. Other important Manhattan Project work was done by scientists who were given space in the offices of a front company in the Woolworth Building, at 233 Broadway.\n\nOne name that was suggested for the new, supersecret effort was a mouthful that Groves worried would get noticed — Laboratory for the Development of Substitute Materials. Groves opted for plain vanilla, calling it the Manhattan Engineer District as “a way to make it sound normal,” Norris said. “No one would be suspicious of what was going on.”"

        "text": "This image released by Universal Pictures shows Jason Clarke is Roger Robb in a scene from “Oppenheimer.” (Melinda Sue Gordon/Universal Pictures via AP) Movie Review: A bomb and its fallout in Christopher Nolan’s ‘Oppenheimer’ Movie Review: A bomb and its fallout in Christopher Nolan’s ‘Oppenheimer’\n\nChristopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” is a kinetic thing of dark, imposing beauty that quakes with the disquieting tremors of a forever rupture in the course of human history.\n\n“Oppenheimer,” a feverish three-hour immersion in the life of Manhattan Project mastermind J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), is poised between the shock and aftershock of the terrible revelation, as one character calls it, of a divine power.\n\nThere are times in Nolan’s latest opus that flames fill the frame and visions of subatomic particles flitter across the screen — montages of Oppenheimer’s own churning visions. But for all the immensity of “Oppenheimer,” this is Nolan’s most human-scaled film — and one of his greatest achievements.\n\nIt’s told principally in close-ups, which, even in the towering detail of IMAX 70mm, can’t resolve the vast paradoxes of Oppenheimer. He was said to be a magnetic man with piercing blue eyes (Murphy has those in spades) who became the father of the atomic bomb but, in speaking against nuclear proliferation and the hydrogen bomb, emerged as America’s postwar conscience.\n\nNolan, writing his own adaptation of Martin J. Sherwin and Kai Bird’s Pulitzer Prize-winning 2005 book “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,” layers the build-up to the Manhattan Project with two moments from years later.\n\nIn 1954, a probing inquiry into Oppenheimer’s leftist politics by a McCarthy-era Atomic Energy Commission stripped him of his security clearance. This provides the frame of “Oppenheimer,” along with a Senate confirmation hearing for Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), who chaired the Atomic Energy Commission and was a stealthy nemesis to Oppenheimer.\n\nThe grubby, political machinations of these hearings — the Strauss section is captured in black and white — act like a stark X-ray of Oppenheimer’s life. It’s an often brutal, unfair interrogation that weighs Oppenheimer’s decisions and accomplishment, inevitably, in moral terms. “Who’d want to justify their whole life?” someone wonders. For the maker of the world’s most lethal weapon, it’s an especially complicated question.\n\nThese separate timelines give “Oppenheimer” — dimly lit and shadowy even in the desert — a noirish quality (Nolan has said all his films are ultimately noirs) in reckoning with a physicist who spent the first half of his life in headlong pursuit of a new science and the second half wrestling with the consequences of his colossal, world-altering invention.\n\n“Oppenheimer” moves too fast to come to any neat conclusions. Nolan, as if reaching to match the electron, dives into the story at a blistering pace. From start to finish, “Oppenheimer” buzzes with a heady frequency, tracking Oppenheimer as a promising student in the then-unfolding field of quantum mechanics. “Can you hear the music, Robert?” asks the elder Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh). He can, absolutely, but that doesn’t mean finding harmony.\n\nNolan, whose last film was the time-traveling, palindrome-rich “Tenet,” may be the only filmmaker for whom delving into quantum mechanics could be considered a step down in complexity. But “Oppenheimer” is less interested in equations than the chemistry of an expanding mind. Oppenheimer reads “The Waste Land” and looks at modernist painting. He dabbles in the communist thinking of the day. (His mistress, Jean Tatlock, played arrestingly, tragically by Florence Pugh, is a party member.) But he aligns with no single cause. “I like a little wiggle room,” says Oppenheimer.\n\nFor a filmmaker synonymous with grand architectures — psychologies mapped onto subconscious worlds (“Inception”) and cosmic reaches ( “Interstellar” ) — “Oppenheimer” resides more simply in its subject’s fertile imagination and anguished psyche. (The script was written in first person.) Nolan and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema render Oppenheimer’s interiority with flashes of images that stretch across the heavens. His brilliance comes from his limitlessness of thought.\n\nJust how much “wiggle room” Oppenheimer is permitted, though, becomes a more acute point when war breaks out and he’s tasked by Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr. (Matt Damon) to lead the race to beat the Nazis to an atomic bomb. The rapid building of Los Alamos on the white-sand mesas of New Mexico — a site chosen by and with personal meaning to Oppenheimer — might not be so different than the erecting of movie sets for Nolan’s massive films, which likewise tend to culminate with a spectacular explosion.\n\nThere is something inherently queasy about a big-screen spectacle dramatizing the creation — justified or not — of a weapon of mass destruction. Oppenheimer once called the atomic bomb “a weapon for aggressors” wherein “the elements of surprise and terror are as intrinsic to it as are the fissionable nuclei.” Surely a less imperial, leviathan filmmaker than Nolan — a British director making an American epic — might have approached the subject differently.\n\nBut the responsibility of power has long been one of Nolan’s chief subjects (think of the all-powerful surveillance machine of “The Dark Knight”). And “Oppenheimer” is consumed with not the just the ethical quandary of the Manhattan Project but every ethical quandary that Oppenheimer encounters. Big or small, they could all lead to valor or damnation. What makes “Oppenheimer” so unnerving is how indistinguishable one is from the other.\n\n“Oppenheimer” sticks almost entirely to its protagonist’s point of view yet also populates its three-hour film with an incredibly array of faces, all in exquisite detail. Some of the best are Benny Safdie as the hydrogen bomb designer Edward Teller; Jason Clarke as gruff special counsel Roger Robb; Gary Oldman as President Harry Truman; Alden Ehrenreich as an aide to Strauss; Macon Blair as Oppenheimer’s attorney; and Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer, the physicist’s wife.\n\nThe greatest of all of them, though, is Murphy. The actor, a Nolan regular, has always been able to communicate something more disturbing underneath his angular, angelic features. But here, his Oppenheimer is a fascinating coil of contradictions: determined and aloof, present and far-away, brilliant but blind.\n\nDread hangs over him, and over the film, with the inevitable. The future, post-Hiroshima, is sounded most by the wail of children who will grow up in that world; the Oppenheimers’ babies do nothing but cry.\n\nWhen the Trinity test comes at Los Alamos after the toil of some 4,000 people and the expense of $2 billion, there’s a palpable, shuddering sense of history changing inexorably. How Nolan captures these sequences — the quiet before the sound of the explosion; the disquieting, thunderous, flag-waving applause that greets Oppenheimer after — are masterful, unforgettable fusions of sound and image, horror and awe.\n\n“Oppenheimer” has much more to go. Government encroaches on science, with plenty of lessons for today’s threats of annihilation. Downey, in his best performance in years, strides toward the center of the film. You could say the film gets bogged down here, relegating a global story to a drab backroom hearing, preferring to vindicate Oppenheimer’s legacy rather than wrestle with harder questions of fallout. But “Oppenheimer” is never not balanced, uncomfortably, with wonder at what humans are capable of, and fear that we don’t know what to do with it.\n\n“Oppenheimer,” a Universal Pictures release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for some sexuality, nudity and language. Running time: 180 minutes. Four stars out of four.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP"

        "text": "Director Christopher Nolan is well known for avoiding computer generated effects in his films when possible, preferring instead to capture all the action in-camera. But Nolan's penchant for doing things the old-fashioned way goes beyond what moviegoers see on screen.\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter this week, Nolan revealed that his \"kids would probably say I'm a complete Luddite\" because of how tech-averse he is in his working life.\n\nThe \"Tenet\" director, who in 2020 told People that he uses a flip phone over a smartphone, said that he chooses to not get too \"involved\" with technology so as to maintain focus.\n\n\"It's about the level of distraction,\" Nolan said. \"If I'm generating my material and writing my own scripts, being on a smartphone all day wouldn't be very useful for me.\"\n\nBack in 2020, he described himself as \"easily distractible.\"\n\n\"I don't really want to have access to the internet every time when I'm bored,\" he said at the time. \"I do a lot of my best thinking in those kind of in-between moments that people now fill with online activity, so it benefits me.\"\n\nBut his old-school ways don't stop there. The computer that the 52-year-old writes his scripts on isn't connected to the internet, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nNolan also prefers to hand deliver his scripts to actors rather than sending them digitally. While he said this has given him a reputation for working \"in secrecy,\" Nolan said the truth is anything but.\n\n\"It's not secrecy, it's privacy,\" he said. \"It's being able to try things, to make mistakes, to be as adventurous as possible. And to be able to sit with somebody who's just read what you've written and get their take on it, see how they connect with it in a very human, face-to-face way.\"\n\nDating back to his 2000 breakout hit \"Memento,\" Nolan has written every one of his films save for 2002's \"Insomnia.\" His latest movie, the hotly anticipated \"Oppenheimer,\" will hit theaters on July 21.\n\nDON'T MISS: Want to be smarter and more successful with your money, work & life?

        "text": "As thousands of moviegoers gear up for double features of Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan‘s “Oppenheimer,” one person taking joy in the “Barbenheimer” craze is Nolan himself. Although his movie will be battling “Barbie” at the box office, Nolan recently told IGN that “it’s terrific” to have both summer tentpoles open on the same day.\n\n“Summer, in a healthy marketplace, is always crowded, and we’ve been doing this a long time,” Nolan said. “I think for those of us who care about movies, we’ve been really waiting to have a crowded marketplace again, and now it’s here and that’s terrific.”\n\nCillian Murphy, who stars in the title role of “Oppenehimer,” agreed with Nolan, telling IGN: “I think it’s great. I mean, I’ll be going to see ‘Barbie.’ I can’t wait to see it. I think it’s just great for the industry and for audiences that we have two amazing films by amazing filmmakers coming out the same day. Could spend a whole day in the cinema, what’s better than that?”\n\n“I love the fact that people are talking about going to two movies in a weekend,” added “Oppenheimer” co-star Matt Damon. “Ben [Affleck] and I used to go to two movies every weekend, and I think people should do that.”\n\nA third “Oppenheimer” cast member, Emily Blunt, called it “awesome” for the two movies to be opening at once as “the interest in the variety of what’s available is so awesome.”\n\nWhile “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” were originally pitted as rivals (most likely because Nolan left “Barbie” studio Warner Bros. after over a decade to make “Oppenheimer” at Universal), the two movies have started to uplift one another in recent weeks. AMC Theatres reported on July 10 that over 20,000 members of its AMC Stubs program have purchased tickets to see both “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” on the same day.\n\n“That more than 20,000 moviegoers have already made plans and purchased tickets to see ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ on the same day is a great sign that the growing online conversation around seeing both of these incredible films is turning into ticket sales,” said Elizabeth Frank, executive VP of worldwide programming and chief content officer at AMC Theatres.\n\n“Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” open in theaters July 21 from Warner Bros. and Universal Pictures, respectively."

Come on, tell me,\" recalls the actress. \"And he just said, 'You're going to just love it. You're going to love it. It's so focused, there's no chaos, it's very giving, it's collaborative,' and [he said] how amazing he was with actors. I think that is the great beauty of Chris. There are directors who are led by the visuals, or there are directors who are pretty good with actors, but you never find where someone is as mirroredly brilliant at both.

        "text": "As far back as Batman Begins in 2005, Christopher Nolan has been making films rated in the PG-13 bracket, or 12A in the UK. That changes with Oppenheimer. The biopic of the ‘father of the atomic bomb’ marks Nolan’s first R-rated (or 15 certificate) film since Insomnia in 2002.\n\nThe BBFC states that Oppenheimer’s 15 certificate is due to \"strong language, sex\", but there are other aspects of the film that ensure it’s not exactly all-ages viewing, from alcoholism to all-consuming guilt, to the general threat of nuclear annihilation.\n\nOn the latest episode of the Inside Total Film podcast, Nolan addresses Oppenheimer’s R-rating. Asked if he knew from the outset that Oppenheimer would necessitate that certification, he says, “Yeah, definitely.”\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy) is an extremely complex and contradictory figure. He’s a scientific genius, lover of the arts, and has an almost savant-level facility with languages. But he’s also a dilettante, a womaniser, and unstable, to list a few of the adjectives thrown at him.\n\n“Oppenheimer’s sexuality – who he was as a person, and how that expressed itself – is a very, very important part to understanding both what motivated him and what pushed him, how he thought,” continues Nolan. “But also the obsessions that ultimately had tremendous consequence in his later life for him, and, by proxy, frankly, for the entire world.\n\n\"It was very important to tell his story in a fully realised way. And so, when I brought the project to the studio, they knew the length it was going to be [Oppenheimer has a running time of three hours], and they knew it was going to be R-rated. I was very clear about that.\n\n“It was something we definitely anticipated. We’re just dealing with a very serious and complex subject. I didn’t want to have to shy away from any aspect of it.”\n\n(Image credit: Universal)\n\nAnd asked if he sees Oppenheimer as a bleak film, Nolan says: “It’s an interesting analogy for me with Dunkirk. When I was making Dunkirk, I knew, as a British person, the freighted emotion of that story, of that sort of national story that we have, that you grow up with. It’s so extreme, that what I decided to do in the telling of it was to really play against that, and have relatively anonymous characters in not specifically emotional situations, to make an objectively intense film, trusting that the emotion of the story is so great [inherently] that it would actually be sort of, in a way, magnified by that.\n\n“I think I’ve done something in a similar vein with Oppenheimer in that the darkness of the story is so inherent in just what the atomic bomb is, and what it’s meant for the world. We’re really pushing against that in the film, and trying to find the suspense, the fun, the excitement, the incredible relationships… I think the underlying darkness is undeniable. By the end, it overwhelms the film. It’s hard to explain that mechanism exactly. But it feels appropriate. It feels like what the story should always be.”\n\nOppenheimer opens in cinemas on 21 July.

The podcast episode aired on Thursday.\n\n\"You look at what that did and where that went with everything.

        "text": "Josh Hartnett revealed to Playboy magazine in 2015 that he talked with Christopher Nolan about taking on the role of the Caped Crusader in the director’s “Batman Begins,” which launched Warner Bros.’ billion-dollar grossing “Dark Knight” trilogy. How far did those talks go before Nolan settled on Christian Bale instead? In a new interview on the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast, Nolan confirmed talks with Hartnett took place, but his casting never got too serious.\n\n“No, it never got that far,” Nolan said when asked if he screen-tested Hartnett for the role of Batman.\n\n“I met with Josh and if I recall, he was a young actor whose work I was very interested in,” Nolan added. “I had an initial conversation with him but he had read my brother’s script for ‘The Prestige’ at the time and was more interested in getting involved with that. So it never went further than that.”\n\nHartnett was not cast in “Batman Begins,” nor was he cast in “The Prestige.” Both films starred Bale. Hartnett would have to wait over a decade to get his chance to work with Nolan, which he did in the upcoming “Oppenheimer.” Hartnett plays Ernest Lawrence, a nuclear physicist and the inventor of the cyclotron who becomes J. Robert Oppenheimer’s close friend at the University of California, Berkley.\n\nHartnett isn’t the only “Oppenheimer” actor with ties to Nolan’s Batman. In a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, Nolan confirmed his “Oppenheimer” lead Cillian Murphy screen tested for the role of Batman. Both men knew Murphy was not right for the part, but Nolan wanted Murphy to screen test in front of studio executives so they could see his acting chops.\n\n“Everybody was so excited by watching you perform that when I then said to them, ‘Okay, Christian Bale is Batman, but what about Cillian to play Scarecrow?’ There was no dissent,” Nolan remembered. “All the previous Batman villains had been played by huge movie stars: Jack Nicholson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jim Carrey, that kind of thing. That was a big leap for them and it really was purely on the basis of that test. So that’s how you got to play Scarecrow.”\n\n“Oppenheimer” opens in theaters July 21 from Universal Pictures.

        "text": "NEW YORK – Like most savvy actors, Matt Damon always picks up the phone for Christopher Nolan.\n\nThe A-lister, who previously appeared in Nolan’s 2014 film “Interstellar,” was planning to take a break from acting when the Oscar-nominated director called about “Oppenheimer” (in theaters Friday), his chilling new historical drama.\n\n“I had told my wife I was taking time off,” says Damon, speaking to USA TODAY in a joint interview with co-star Emily Blunt before the Screen Actors Guild strike. “This was something we literally negotiated, but the one caveat was ‘if Chris Nolan calls.’ He was my get-back-to-work card, and then he actually called, which was a wonderful surprise.”\n\n'Oppenheimer':Christopher Nolan made his new movie because he thought he'd die in a nuclear Armageddon\n\nMatt Damon brings levity to the 'wildly unpopular' Leslie Groves\n\nIn the white-knuckle epic, Damon plays gruff U.S. Army officer Leslie Groves, who calls on physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) to oversee the creation of the atomic bomb during World War II. Groves was “wildly unpopular” with the scientists, Damon says, and frequently butted heads with Oppenheimer. But there was still “mutual respect” between the two men.\n\n“They’re complete polar opposites,” says Damon, sitting at a hotel in New York's Tribeca neighborhood. “The military is obsessed with secrecy, and the scientists are trying to get to the root of the problem, which they do by sharing. Groves constantly felt like a kindergarten teacher chasing these guys around. So Chris found some comedy there, which is good for a movie about something so serious.”\n\n“Maybe that’s why he cast you,” Blunt suggests. “Everyone loves you and you have a natural warmth. If you cast someone unlikable playing someone unlikable, it would’ve been (alienating).”\n\nEmily Blunt's Kitty Oppenheimer is 'volatile' yet fiercely loyal\n\nBlunt portrays Kitty, Oppenheimer’s caustic, alcoholic wife. When Oppenheimer is probed by government officials about possible Communist ties, she demands that he stop feeling sorry for himself. She’s similarly unsympathetic about the death of his former lover.\n\n“Kitty didn’t do small talk. She only did big talk,” Blunt says. “There’s a lot about her that wouldn’t necessarily be ‘likable,’ but I don’t think she cared. She was such a force of personality.” Toward the end of the film, “she’s become so volatile and unpredictable – the drinking is out of control. But he says to his defense (team), ‘Kitty and I have walked through fire together, and I believe in her.’ She’ll fight for him when he won’t fight for himself.”\n\nThe movie's Trinity test scene was 'beautiful' yet 'nightmarish' to behold\n\nOne of the movie’s most thrilling sequences is the Trinity test, when the first nuclear weapon was detonated in the New Mexico desert in 1945. The bomb’s mushroom cloud and blinding light were recreated using practical effects.\n\n“Because the explosion is real, it’s as beautiful as it is nightmarish,” Blunt says. “Because you know it’s not (computer-generated), you can’t dissociate from it.”\n\n“You can’t take your eyes off it, but it’s the most terrible thing you’ve ever seen,” Damon adds. Witnessing it on the set, “it was a big boom. Everybody had their earplugs in.”\n\n'Barbenheimer':How a movie meme inspired the 'crazy, weird' double feature\n\nEmily Blunt recalls her 'Devil Wears Prada' moment with director Christopher Nolan\n\n“Oppenheimer” is the second film Blunt, 40, and Damon, 52, have made together, including the 2011 sci-fi thriller “The Adjustment Bureau.” Blunt says they would “hang out constantly” while shooting the latter, going on double dates with her husband, John Krasinski, and Damon’s wife, Luciana Barroso.\n\n“Now we’re vacation buddies and neighbors,” says Blunt, who lives in the same Brooklyn apartment building as Damon. “I know, it’s ridiculous. This is strange not to see Matt in his sweats and slippers.”\n\n“The only time I wear shoes is when we do interviews together,” Damon quips. “I’ve got a great pair of house slippers, and I’m going to put them right on when I get home. I did accidentally wear my Ugg slippers on a school run once.”\n\n“Do you know who hates Uggs more than anyone?” Blunt asks. “Christopher Nolan. I’ve never known anyone to detest a pair of Uggs more than Chris Nolan. It’s a testament to how he wants everything on set to look as it would (in the period). If there’s a plastic bottle in the shot, he’s like, ‘Ugh!’ He hates to even look at it. I would sometimes put on some Uggs and I’d just get this withering look down to my feet – it was like being in ‘The Devil Wears Prada’ again. Just the look down to the shoes. And I'd go, 'I know, I know. But I'm just sitting on an apple box in the background today!' \"\n\nAs a joke, Blunt gave Nolan a pair of Uggs at the end of the shoot. His wife, Emma Thomas, “wrote to me and was like, ‘Brilliant wrap gift. He’s wearing them now,’ \" Blunt recalls with a laugh. “I was so pleased!”"

We meet the director in LA to talk about going nuclear.\n\nRead an extract of our exclusive Oppenheimer feature from our July 2023 issue below, or see the full piece here.\n\nWe see the lower fifth of Christopher Nolan. The shoes. A bit of trouser. A small section of Christopher Nolan on the move, glimpsed through the bottom of a windowed wall, the rest blocked out by frosted glass, obscuring him until he’s ready.\n\nHe stops to talk to someone, but even then, despite hearing his voice, we can’t make out the words. So here we sit, waiting for him in a small conference room, seeing and hearing bits of him, unable to piece it all together. It’s enigmatic. It’s cryptic. It’s — dare we say — cinematic. And very Christopher Nolan. He just can’t help himself.\n\nYes, for a man who likes his films to pose questions rather than provide answers, who constructs them like puzzles, this all makes sense. It’s early May in the Los Angeles post-production facility where his films are taken to the finish line. In rooms and offices there is evidence of an impressive career — framed newspaper cuttings about The Prestige, various awards, an Inception poster, a Batpod maquette, framed cells from the Dark Night trilogy, and film cans containing reels from his latest opus, Oppenheimer, a bit of which he’s just played for Empire in a screening room so loud it felt like an earthquake. As it should — this is a film about the man responsible for the development of the atomic bomb. The footage is, we tell Nolan as he finally appears, unnerving. “I think ‘unnerving’ is definitely a good word to describe it!” he laughs."

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's not exactly controversial to say that Christopher Nolan's \"The Dark Knight\" is one of the best superhero movies ever made. It frequently tops \"best of\" lists, with many critics praising the battle between Christian Bale's bat-brained vigilante and Heath Ledger's chaotic Joker.\n\nBut at its heart, \"The Dark Knight\" isn't a superhero movie, not really. It's a crime thriller with a few outlandish outfits. After all, the story hinges on political corruption in the mayor's office and in the Gotham City Police Department, which allows the mob to move its dirty money around the city and into off-shore accounts.\n\nIt's a far cry from a typical superhero \"magic orb\" plot, where a costumed crusader has to stop a bad guy from getting a specific object in order to save the universe — sorry Marvel, but it's been done to death.\n\nHeath Ledger as the Joker. Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nIf you took Bruce Wayne's military-grade weapons and body armor bat suit away from him, the story would pretty much work the same. It would still be about a man determined to root out injustice and corruption from his city, while also grappling with a domestic terrorist who revels in chaos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHeath Ledger's Joker is one of the purest and most blood-chilling villains because he isn't weighed down by a tragic, complicated origin story. He simply wages a psychological war of terror on Gotham in an attempt to make the city destroy itself. His methods and motivations are chaos.\n\nThat lack of justification makes the Joker all the more terrifying — no colorful costume and decrepit face paint needed.\n\nNolan's grounded approach makes things far more fascinating than the typical CGI battles audiences are used to. One of the most powerful (and intimidating) scenes of the film is Batman trying to interrogate the Joker at the GCPD.\n\nLedger and Bale give truly dedicated performances that pull the audience to the edge of their seats. It's a masterclass in tension.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBatman will stop at nothing to save people, dishing out brutality as an interrogation technique, whereas the Joker simply can't be bargained with — and he enjoys the power that gives him over people. It's the type of script we don't see as often in the superhero genre anymore.\n\nUnfortunately, in the 15 years since its release, studios seem to have taken the wrong cues from Nolan's Batman trilogy — not everything needs to be injected with gritty realism. Instead, filmmakers should ask themselves if their films, like Nolan's, can stand on their own without the high-octane stunts, overcomplicated multiverses, and silly capes."

        "text": "Apple TV+'s Foundation bucks a recent trend in how sci-fi television shows are made. Rather than building a virtual soundstage, often called a \"Volume,\" to create digital backdrops for actors to play against, or even resorting to tried and true green screen filming, Foundation films many scenes on location across multiple countries. ComicBook.com spoke to David S. Goyer during the Foundation Season 2 press junket and asked why he has taken Foundation's production in that direction. Goyer told us that part of it is his nature, and part of is a filmmaking philosophy influenced by working with Christopher Nolan on projects like The Dark Knight Trilogy.\n\n\"Well, number one, I'm just a contrarian,\" Goyer says. \"If the bulk of the people are going this way, just by my nature I'll go in the other direction. We don't use a Volume or anything like that on our show, I would say at least half the show we film location, on remote locations. Part of that is just my filmmaking philosophy. I did a lot of shows with Chris Nolan. That's his philosophy and he likes to do as much as possible in camera.\"\n\nHe continues, \"I just believe that nothing can replace that sense of reality that grittiness to actually being there, whether it's the light, whether it's the grit in the air when we're in the Canary Islands, whether it's the cold in Iceland. I love the natural beauty and I think that we've always filmed in multiple countries because so much of our show takes place in different worlds and I just think that's what sets our show apart from so many of these other shows that are made largely in a virtual environment. I'm completely committed to making the show that way. It's more difficult but I think the results speak for themselves.\"\n\nWhat is Foundation Season 2 about? How to watch:\n\nAccording to the official synopsis for Foundation Season 2, \"More than a century after the season one finale, tension mounts throughout the galaxy in Foundation season two. As the Cleons unravel, a vengeful queen plots to destroy Empire from within. Hari, Gaal and Salvor discover a colony of Mentalics with psionic abilities that threaten to alter psychohistory itself. The Foundation has entered its religious phase, promulgating the Church of Seldon throughout the Outer Reach and inciting the Second Crisis: war with Empire. The monumental adaptation of Foundation chronicles the stories of four crucial individuals transcending space and time as they overcome deadly crises, shifting loyalties, and complicated relationships that will ultimately determine the fate of humanity.\"\n\nFoundation Season 2 features returning stars Jared Harris as Hari Seldon, Lee Pace as Brother Day, Lou Llobell as Gaal Dornick, Leah Harvey Salvor Hardin, Laura Birn as Eto Demerzel, Cassian Bilton as Brother Dawn, and Terrence Mann as Brother Dusk. It also introduces newcomers to the series, including Isabella Laughland, Kulvinder Ghir, Ella-Rae Smith, Holt McCallany, Rachel House, Nimrat Kaur, Ben Daniels, and Dimitri Leonidas. David S. Goyer is Foundation's showrunner.\n\nFoundation returned for its second season on Friday, July 14th. New episodes debut on Apple TV+ on Fridays.\n\nEditors note: This interview was conducted prior to the SAG actors' strike."

        "text": "This 52-year-old British-American film director is the genius behind some of the past two decades’ biggest – and most mind-boggling – cinematic moments, including Memento (2001), The Dark Knight (2008), Interstellar (2014), Dunkirk (2017) and Tenet (2020).\n\nSo, one burning question remains: who’s the wealthiest director of them all? We asked the internet whizzes over at Celebrity Net Worth to find out.\n\nAmong the auteurs who built their reputation on both writing and directing in their own iconoclastic style are Inception and Interstellar brainiac Christopher Nolan, who’s all set to unleash his much-awaited Oppenheimer this July; and James Cameron, the Terminator-to-Titanic maestro who kept the hype alive for last year’s Avatar 2 , well over a decade after its first instalment hit the screens.\n\nWe have iconic figures like George Lucas, the genius who created the multiplex-blowing Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises, and Peter Jackson, the mastermind behind The Lord of the Rings and Hobbit film adaptations.\n\nThey are the ones responsible for what you see on the screen – making those impeccable casting choices and shaping the overall vision of the production.\n\nWhile we often find ourselves captivated by the glamorous ( and handsomely rewarded ) actors and actresses bringing beloved films and TV shows to life, let’s not forget that it’s the brilliant minds behind the camera – the directors – who truly deserve our gratitude.\n\nHis latest film, Oppenheimer, has generated plenty of buzz ahead of its release this July, covering the true story of J. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Peaky Blinder Cillian Murphy), the theoretical physicist who developed the world’s first nuclear bomb.\n\n11. J.J. Abrams – US$300 million\n\nJ.J. Abrams attends the 2020 Vanity Fair Oscar Party at Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in Beverly Hills, California, in February 2020. Photo: Getty Images\n\nJ.J. Abrams, 57, is best known as sci-fi whizz – with the dubious honour of helming fresh instalments in the notoriously rivalled Star Trek and Star Wars universes. The American film and TV series director’s most famous works include Felicity (1999), Alias (2001-2005), Mission: Impossible III (2006), Star Trek (2009) and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2009).\n\n10. Ivan Reitman – US$300 million\n\nDirector Ivan Reitman accepts the lifetime achievement award at the Big Screen Achievement Awards at CinemaCon in Las Vegas, US, in March 2014. Photo: AP\n\nOne of the least immediately recognisable names on this list, the late, great Ivan Reitman made his mark with 1984’s Ghostbusters and its 1989 sequel, and comedies like My Super Ex-Girlfriend (2006) and No Strings Attached (2011). The Czechoslovakian-Canadian filmmaker was worth an estimated US$300 million at the time of his death at age 75, in 2022.\n\n9. Ridley Scott – US$400 million\n\nDirector Ridley Scott on the set of the film, The Martian. Photo: Peter Mountain\n\nThis Englishman made his claim to fame with Alien back in 1979 and has since directed a string of bona fide classics including Blade Runner (1982), Thelma & Louise (1991), G.I. Jane (1997), Gladiator (2000) and Hannibal (2001). More recent works like The Martian (2015) and House of Gucci (2021) have added to his US$400 million fortune, while his forthcoming historical epic Napoleon will star acting legend Joaquin Phoenix.\n\nScott, 85, has also been tapped to work on multiple Chanel No 5 ads over his decades-long career.\n\n8. Francis Ford Coppola – US$400 million\n\nFilmmaker and winemaker Francis Ford Coppola, poses for a picture at Grand Hyatt in Wan Chai in October 2012. Photo: May Tse\n\nA totemic figure in every sense of the word, in the 70s FFC was responsible for both the genre-defining Godfather saga and the harrowing Vietnam war portrait Apocalypse Now. While his later work never mounted the same critical peaks, he continued to make bank in later years with Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1992) and Twixt (2011). The 84-year-old American’s daughter Sofia is the filmmaker behind Lost in Translation and Marie Antoinette.\n\n7. Mel Gibson – US$425 million\n\nAmerican actor Mel Gibson arrives on the red carpet for the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts Awards (AACTA) in Sydney, Australia, in December 2016. Photo: EPA\n\nA tricky one here, as Mel Gibson no doubt made the bulk of his cash through acting. However, he is a director of note, too, and the 67-year-old New Yorker has proven his talents helming films including Braveheart (1995), of which he also stars in, The Passion of the Christ (2004) and Hacksaw Ridge (2016).\n\n6. Michael Bay – US$450 million\n\nHollywood director Michael Bay, who was in Hong Kong for the filming of Transformers: Age of Extinction, in October 2013. Photo: Nora Tam\n\nKnown for making big-budget, fast-paced films, Michael Bay ranks No 6 on this list – the bulk of which can likely be chalked up to his role steering five movies in the Transformers franchise. However the divisive 58-year-old also counts earlier epic smashes Bad Boys (1995), The Rock (1996), Armageddon (1998) and Pearl Harbour (2001) on his CV.\n\n5. Tyler Perry – US$800 million\n\nTyler Perry attends his studio’s grand opening gala at Tyler Perry Studios in October 2019, in Atlanta. Photo: Getty Images\n\nWith nearly a billion bucks in the bank, Tyler Perry comes in strong at No 5 on this list. While it’s not all made from directing work, the 53-year-old multi-hyphenate showbiz guru – who’s good pals with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle , and Oprah Winfrey – has brought us plenty of comedic relief with the Madea franchise, Meet the Browns (2009-2010), Ruthless (2020-2023) and more.\n\n4. James Cameron – US$800 million\n\nCanadian filmmaker James Cameron poses during a photocall for Avatar: The Way of Water in London, UK, in December 2022. Photo: AFP\n\nAfter making plenty off The Terminator film franchise, Titanic (1997) and Avatar (2009), Cameron bought himself the luxury of time, waiting some 13 years for the technology to catch up with his vision to realise last year’s Avatar: The Way of Water. Making up for lost time? The 68-year-old Canadian filmmaker has two more instalments planned.\n\n3. Peter Jackson – US$1.5 billion\n\nDirector Peter Jackson arrives at the Los Angeles premiere of The Hobbit: The Battle Of The Five Armies in Los Angeles, California, in December 2014. Photo: AP\n\nThe first billionaire on our list is none other than Peter Jackson, the New Zealander who took into his hands the challenging yet (deeply) rewarding task of taking The Lord of the Rings saga to the big screen.\n\nActor Elijah Wood portrays Frodo in a scene from The Lord of The Rings: The Return of The King. Photo: Handout\n\nThis 61-year-old film maestro can thank his LOTR and Hobbit trilogies income for his place in the 10-figure club – those films have grossed US$6 billion worldwide, per Forbes. He sold a chunk of his Weta digital film effects shop to Unity Software for US$1.6 billion in cash and stock in 2021.\n\n2. Steven Spielberg – US$8 billion\n\nUS director Steven Spielberg speaks onstage during the 92nd Oscars at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, California, in February 2020. Photo: AFP\n\nAnother household name who’s made billions over the years is Steven Spielberg. While accounts differ, Celebrity Net Worth estimates he has US$8 billion in his account.\n\nKnown as the “King of Entertainment”, the 76-year-old’s technical genius is beyond dispute, bringing to life unforgettable cinematic gems like Jaws (1975), E.T. (1982), Jurassic Park (1993), Schindler’s List (1993), Catch Me if you Can (2002) and of course the first four iconic Indiana Jones films (James Mangold took over for this summer’s fifth outing).\n\n1. George Lucas – US$10 billion\n\nStar Wars creator George Lucas poses with stormtroopers, characters in the Star Wars movies, at the Star Wars: Where Science Meets the Imagination exhibition in Boston, US, in 2005. Photo: Reuters\n\nGeorge Lucas, 79, has accumulated an – ahem – galactic fortune of US$10 billion, according to Celebrity Net Worth, anyway. And he’s only directed six films in his life.\n\nHis third movie however, was none other than Star Wars (1977), and he held onto creative control – and the lucrative merchandise rights! – of the franchise forevermore. (He only stepped back into the chair, some 22 years later, to direct the series’ “first” three episodes – his fourth, fifth, sixth and final directional credits, 1999-2005).\n\nThere’s also the small matter of conceiving and producing the blockbuster Indiana Jones series – and then getting frenemy Spielberg to direct it …\n\nIn 2012, Lucas added a hefty lump sum to his net worth by selling his Lucasfilm production company to Disney for US$4.1 billion in stock and cash, per Forbes. The force is very strong with this one."

        "text": "Christopher Nolan is a legendary director, with his filmography — including renowned movies such as “Inception,” “The Dark Knight” and “Interstellar” — having gained distinction because of his passion for developing visually and auditorily stunning films. The consequence of his painstaking commitment to his style is a lack of substance at times — a heavy criticism of “Tenet,” Nolan’s most recently released film prior to “Oppenheimer.”\n\nWhile “Oppenheimer” fits right in with his best work at times, it occasionally falls into the exact same pitfalls that hold his other movies back from being full-on masterpieces.\n\n“Oppenheimer,” starring Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, details the life of the “father of the atomic bomb” as he races to assemble a team of scientists and develop the infamous weapon before rival scientists in enemy countries. Amid this already monumental challenge, he struggles with accusations of being a communist ally and an increasingly complicated personal life.\n\nThe story can’t reasonably be criticized, as it is a cinematic retelling of Oppenheimer’s real life, but the way Nolan chooses to tell the story is somewhat questionable.\n\nNolan is known for directing blockbusters like superhero movies, and “Oppenheimer” can sometimes feel like a superhero origin story rather than a true biopic. Cameos and name drops of famous scientists are shot like easter eggs viewers might expect to see in a Marvel film; moreover, the dialogue features quips and one-liners that seem thoroughly out of place.\n\n“Oppenheimer” is at its best when it focuses on Murphy’s brilliant performance and the deep dive into Oppenheimer’s psychology, more akin to the individualistic character study expected of a biopic.\n\nAn issue Nolan runs into even in his most successful movies is the repeated use of female characters’ suffering to bring emotional depth to his main characters — a martyrized manic pixie dream girl of sorts.\n\n“Oppenheimer” is based on a true story, so Nolan didn’t write these characters from scratch, but he did purposefully select what parts of their real-life story to show. While Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) is developed well, the treatment of Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), his first love and on-and-off-again relationship, is shockingly disappointing for someone so important to Oppenheimer’s story.\n\nShe has very limited scenes — a shame in and of itself because of Pugh’s stage presence — and when she does appear, she acts more as a hardship for Oppenheimer to overcome rather than her own distinct person. Nolan neglects not only to pay much attention to Tatlock’s own accomplishments as a brilliant scientist but also her struggles with her sexuality, a defining characteristic of her own life as well as of her relationship with Oppenheimer.\n\nIn doing so, he takes a complex real-world person and makes her one-dimensional. In fact, it’s almost implied Tatlock’s struggles with mental health weren’t due to the pressure of being a non-heteronormative person in the 1940s, but rather because of her failing relationship with Oppenheimer.\n\nWhile the movie is ultimately an Oppenheimer biopic and not a Jean Tatlock biopic, you’d think that a person arguably more consequential to Oppenheimer’s life than his own wife would be treated with the care she deserves, especially when failing to do so sacrifices historical accuracy.\n\nAnother common struggle of Nolan’s that is seen again in “Oppenheimer” is his approach to pacing. The movie actually moves through Oppenheimer’s life fairly quickly; however, Nolan chooses to show so much of the story that the plot still seems slow at times, especially due to the immense number of time jumps back and forth through Oppenheimer’s career.\n\nFor instance, if the ignition of the Trinity test — the first atomic bomb ever dropped and the culmination of Oppenheimer’s life’s work — was the peak of action and build-up in the movie, “Oppenheimer” might have one of the longest third acts in all of cinema.\n\nThe second half of the movie deals with a series of trials faced by Oppenheimer and adjacent scientists, soldiers and politicians. While it is extremely tense and enjoyable in a manner reminiscent of political dramas, what audiences came to see had already exploded by then, and the film’s remainder may drag for those less interested in the politics of it all.\n\nNolan urged the film community to see “Oppenheimer” in specific formats leading up to its release, saying that IMAX 70mm is the way he intended it to be seen. However, only 19 theaters with the capacity to show IMAX 70mm exist in the entire United States, so the option to see it as Nolan intended isn’t viable for most people.\n\nWhile Nolan and other experts said audiences would still enjoy it in other theaters, a question must be asked when the needle is pushed from a movie being an engaging narrative to a sensory spectacle. The best movies should be able to be enjoyed anywhere, simply accentuated by the magic of a theater.\n\nWhile “Oppenheimer” is without a doubt entertaining, it does feel as though the correlation between the size of the screen it is viewed on and the overall audience experience is far too intertwined.\n\n“Oppenheimer” is simultaneously emblematic of Nolan’s greatest strengths and weaknesses, but it can never be faulted for a lack of spectacle. It should be criticized out of respect for its ambition; great works of art intrinsically invite criticism due to the boundaries they have to push. “Oppenheimer” grips the audience with its unique blend of psychological despair and American patriotism, and despite its faults, is still a spectacle worth seeing on the big screen.\n\nRating: 3.5/5"

Sherwin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning book “American Prometheus,” tells the definitive story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, known as the father of the atomic bomb. The film, starring Cillian Murphy as the eponymous scientist, pulls straight from the 700-page biography, which traces Oppenheimer’s life starting with his time at Cambridge, where he earned a reputation as an intellectual prodigy. As a physicist, Oppenheimer made significant contributions to quantum mechanics and theoretical physics, earning him great respect among his peers.\n\nThe narrative takes a dramatic turn with the onset of World War II, when Oppenheimer was appointed as the scientific director of the Manhattan Project, a top-secret government initiative aimed at developing the first atomic bomb. His leadership and organizational skills were instrumental to the project, which culminated with the devastating nuclear weapons dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing over 200,000 Japanese people.\n\nIn his introduction to the screenplay, Bird praises Nolan’s skill in extremely complex life story and miraculously turning it into “visual art that is faithful both to the history and the man.”\n\nWhen Bird read Nolan’s screenplay, he was “struck by how faithful it was to the book, capturing what was always most important to Sherwin: the paradoxes at the heart of Oppenheimer’s character and the intimate details that dovetailed with enormous plate shifts of world history.”\n\nBuy Nolan’s complete “Oppenheimer” script below:"

        "text": "The film soared past a record-breaking $180 million worldwide to a chorus of rave reviews, with filmmaker Paul Schrader calling it the ‘Best’ and ‘Most Important Film of This Century.’ The movie is “certified fresh” with a stellar 94% fresh critics rating and a 94% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, and an ‘A’ Cinemascore.\n\n“Oppenheimer” is Nolan’s first feature at Universal and a company-wide priority. A Comcast NBCUniversal Symphony title, the company leveraged the unequalled breadth of its portfolio in support of the film. The movie’s historical foundation made for a perfect partnership with NBC’s world class news division.\n\nOn July 15, Universal and Syncopy commemorated the anniversary of The Trinity Test with a screening in New York featuring a post-event conversation with filmmaker Christopher Nolan and some of the greatest scientific minds of our time including Dr. Thom Mason, Director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, world-renowned theoretical physicist Dr. Carlo Rovelli, the event's honorary chairmen: Nobel Prize winning theoretical physicist Dr. Kip Thorne, who served as a consultant on the film, and Pulitzer Prize winner Kai Bird, co-author of the book “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,” the basis for Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” screenplay. Chuck Todd, the Emmy-winning host of NBC's “Meet the Press,” moderated the conversation which also aired on NBC.\n\nOn MSNBC, “Morning Joe” co-host Joe Scarborough sat down for an exclusive interview with “Oppenheimer” writer/director Christopher Nolan and stars Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, and Robert Downey Jr. to discuss the making of the film, which Scarborough described as “breathtaking” and “unlike anything I've ever seen.” The cast opened up about bringing their complex characters to life, shooting on location, the magic of big screen, and more.\n\nMissed the special?

The epic bowed to $4.3M, capturing 44% market share for the day in a highly competitive environment.\n\nThat marks the best Nolan opening day in the market, biggest Hollywood opening of the year there (No. 2 launch of 2023 for all titles), the No. 5 debut day of the pandemic and the No. 4 Universal opening day ever. Presales were outstanding, beating all previous Nolan movies.\n\nAcross 1,600 screens, this is the second-widest release for a Nolan title in Korea, only behind Tenet, which came out during the pandemic when there was no other competition.\n\nOn 20 Imax screens, Oppenheimer generated 9.4% of the total box office for the day. The CVG Egg score currently stands at a strong 92%. The Korea cume is $5.5M through today (not included in the totals above), dominating with a 42% market share on Wednesday.\n\nRELATED: In The Shadow Of ‘Oppenheimer’: ‘A Compassionate Spy’ Reveals American Scientist’s Espionage In Midst Of Manhattan Project\n\nIn total on Tuesday, the Cillian Murphy-led historical drama added $9.6M in 80 markets.

It’s his top non-superhero movie in 62 markets.\n\nOver the weekend, the drama overtook Star Wars: The Last Jedi in the UK to become the third-biggest Imax release of all time. The overall cume there through Wednesday is $59.7M, which is in line with The Dark Knight Rises (-3%) and Dunkirk (+1%).\n\nIn Brazil, Oppenheimer topped the lifetime take of The Dark Knight Rises.\n\nOther standouts include Germany at $36.4M, for the biggest Nolan movie ever in the market; France, with a running total of $29.4M through Tuesday, 23% above The Dark Knight Rises at the same point in release; and Australia, with $21.4M to date, 30% above Inception at the same point.\n\nItaly and China are still to release later this month."

        "text": "Nolan demonstrated this way back in Memento with the resolution to the Sammy Jankis story. After getting to the end of his narrative, Leonard realizes that he’s forgotten who he’s talking to. Eventually, we learn that Leonard misremembers the Jankis story; that he’s combined it with his own life to give himself a sense of justice. But the tragedy of Leonard’s self-deception is better relayed in the panic Pearce plays, tightening his body and jerking toward the phone. It’s better relayed by the black-and-white photography, which uses lighting to highlight shades of gray, suggesting that the truth isn’t as simple as it seems.\n\nThe Human Heart of Nolan’s Cinema\n\nNolan’s latest film Oppenheimer is full of memorable moments, but none as striking as the speech the title character (Cillian Murphy) gives after the bomb he and the scientists of Los Alamos created was then dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. The camera trails behind Oppenheimer as he walks through a stomping and cheering crowd, searching for his composure before he reaches the podium. Each jingoistic remark he manages to spit out earns more screaming applause until the sound suddenly drops out leaving only Murphy’s unvarnished audio.\n\nOne might think that this decision would only intensify the importance of Oppenheimer’s words, but it actually has the opposite effect. The specific things he’s saying don’t matter. They are empty boasts, war-crazed rabble-rousing that fail to match the importance of the bomb. Instead the sound design draws attention to the real concern of the scene: the weight of humanity. As Oppenheimer speaks, the background shakes and blurs, highlighting Murphy’s crumbling and frail frame. An explosion of white illuminates the room, engulfing Murphy’s gaunt face in light and shadow, drowning his heretofore striking blue eyes. Even before Oppenheimer’s POV sees skin melting off the face of celebrants in the audience or charred bodies at his feet, we understand the extreme human cost of the moment.\n\nThe Oppenheimer speech is a surprisingly humane scene from a director who can sometimes seem chilly and intellectual. Movies such as Interstellar, Inception, and Tenet have established Nolan’s reputation as a filmmaker in the Stanley Kubrick vein, more interested in technical bombast and puzzle-box plots than in human connections. But Nolan’s muddled dialogue suggests otherwise. Take Dunkirk, the most small-scale film of his blockbuster era. Detractors might argue that Nolan’s insistence on layered timelines distracts from what is a fairly simple plot about rescuing British soldiers from the titular beach.\n\nHowever, the movie isn’t terribly interested in the plot mechanics. Instead it focuses on the human experiences of the people involved. By interlacing the three timelines, we get the full weight of Tommy’s (Fionn Whitehead) attempts to escape the beach, of Dawson (Mark Rylance) crossing the channel to rescue the soldiers, and of the pilot with the callsign Fortis 1 (Tom Hardy) providing air support. Each one of these characters have significance, no matter how insignificant to the actual mechanics of the evacuation, simply because they are people.\n\nDunkirk succeeds by minimizing the dialogue, making most of Hardy’s lines incomprehensible over the sound of his Spitfire engine. Even the most important words in the film, Winston Churchill’s “We will fight them on the beaches” speech get recited by a mumbling Tommy, who is nearly drowned out by Zimmer’s soaring score. However, it works because we don’t need those words barked with bombast, as Gary Oldman did playing Churchill in The Darkest Hour that same year. Instead we need to see the sadness in Hardy’s eyes as his pilot lands his plane behind enemy lines, the relief on Alex’s (Harry Styles) face when a civilian passes him a beer, the sad recognition shared between Dawson and his son (Tom Glynn-Carney)."

He really believes that his audiences can take this, and from the response that we're getting so far, the audiences are loving it.\"\n\nWhile big Hollywood productions have relied heavily on computers, telling the truth is important enough to Nolan that he avoids computer-generated special effects in favor of real explosions, and the result is stunning on a very big screen, especially given the large IMAX format.\n\nYou can watch the full episode in the media player above.\n\n----------\n\n* Get Eyewitness News Delivered\n\n* Follow us on YouTube\n\n* More local news\n\n* Send us a news tip\n\n* Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts\n\nSubmit a tip or story idea to Eyewitness News\n\nHave a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover?

        "text": "T\n\nDilemma\n\nhe story of the invention of the atomic bomb told in the new film \"Oppenheimer\" is a \"warning\" to the world as we grapple with artificial intelligence, insists the movie's director Christopher Nolan.The British-born maker of \"Memento\", \"Dunkirk\" and the \"Batman\" trilogy said he believes a lot of the anguish around technology \"in our imagination stems from (Robert) Oppenheimer,\" the physicist who helped invent nuclear weapons during World War II.What he and his team at the Los Alamos Laboratory in the United States did was \"the ultimate expression of science... which is such a positive thing, having the ultimate negative consequences,\" Nolan said.Like back then, the startling advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are raising similar fears about the dangers of a technology with potentially uncontrollable consequences.Some worry that AI could escape its creators and endanger humanity, much like scientists and others fretted eight decades ago with the dawn of the nuclear age.\"That was a moment in history. This is one too,\" Nolan's star Cillian Murphy—who plays the haunted scientist—told AFP while the pair were in Paris to promote the film, which opens across the globe this weekend.\"Artificial intelligence researchers refer to the present moment as an 'Oppenheimer moment',\" said Nolan, referring to the first atomic tests, when some feared nuclear fission would lead to an uncontrolled chain reaction that would pulverise the entire planet.Those now working on AI \"look at his story for some guidance as to what is their responsibility—as to what they should be doing,\" Nolan said.\"But I don't think it offers any easy answers. It is a cautionary tale. It shows the dangers.\"\"The emergence of new technologies is quite often accompanied by a sense of dread about where that might lead,\" he argued.Nolan's drama turns on the dilemma this posed for the scientists working on the Manhattan Project, the codename of the drive to develop the bombs that were later dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\"They had lived through World War I and they were trying to end World War II,\" he said.Oppenheimer argued in vain for international control of nuclear weapons, hoping it would lead to peace.The director said many would argue that \"actually some stability in the world has been achieved through the existence of these weapons.\"Personally, I don't find that reassuring, but it just goes to show there are absolutely no easy answers to the dilemma.\"The war in Ukraine has reawakened the threat of nuclear Armageddon raising tensions between the superpowers not seen since the end of the Cold War.Actor Matt Damon, who plays General Leslie Groves, the head of the Manhattan Project, said the last year has been a reality check that the danger of nuclear disaster is still very much there.\"How did I forget about this? It's like the Cold War ended and my brain played a trick on me and said, 'OK, let's put that away, you don't have to worry about that anymore'—which is absurd.\"But as soon as Russia invaded Ukraine \"suddenly overnight it became the most important thing for us all to think about again,\" said the 52-year-old star.\"Oppenheimer\" is facing off against \"Barbie\" in the biggest clash of Hollywood summer blockbusters, with both opening on the same day in a duel the media has dubbed \"Barbenheimer\"."

Geeta has been the inspiration for countless sanyasis, brahmacharis and legends who live a life of self-control and perform selfless noble deeds.”\n\nMahurkar calls the scene “a direct assault on religious beliefs of a billion tolerant Hindus.”\n\nThe official then asked if Nolan would “remove this scene from your film across the world,” adding: “Should you choose to ignore this appeal it would be deemed as a deliberate assault on Indian civilization.”"

        "text": "The wartime Soviet intelligence services had a codename for the Manhattan Project, the US’s plan to build an atom bomb: Enormoz. Christopher Nolan’s new film about it is absolutely Enormoz, maybe his most enormoz so far: a gigantic, post-detonation study, a PTSD narrative procedure filling the giant screen with a million agonised fragments that are the shattered dreams and memories of the project’s haunted, complex driving force, J Robert Oppenheimer, a brilliant physicist with the temperament of an artist who gave humanity the means of its own destruction.\n\nThe main event is that terrifying first demonstration: the Trinity nuclear test in the New Mexico desert in July 1945, when Oppenheimer is said to have silently pondered (and later intoned on TV) Vishnu’s lines from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds …”\n\nThis is the big bang, and no one could have made it bigger or more overwhelming than Nolan. He does this without simply turning it into an action stunt – although this movie, for all its audacity and ambition, never quite solves the problem of its own obtuseness: filling the drama at such length with the torment of genius-functionary Oppenheimer at the expense of showing the Japanese experience and the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nNolan moves back and forth in time, either side of the historic 1945 firebreak, giving us Oppenheimer’s beginnings as a young scientist, lonely and unhappy, electrified by the new developments in quantum mechanics, the young leftist who never became a Communist party member but whose anti-fascism galvanised his desire to develop the bomb before the Nazis could, directing the work of hundreds of scientists.\n\nWatch a trailer for Oppenheimer\n\nLater in the 50s, there is the disillusioned, compromised administrator, hounded by the McCarthyites for his communist connections, nauseated by his own pointless celebrity, by his failure to establish postwar international atomic control and by a single denied thought: the Nazis surrendered long before there was any suggestion they had the weapon, and bombing the defeated Japanese at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was merely to cow the Russians with a ruthless demonstration of the US’s nuclear mastery.\n\nCillian Murphy is an eerily close lookalike for Oppenheimer with his trademark hat and pipe, and is very good at capturing his sense of solitude and emotional imprisonment, giving us the Oppenheimer million-yard stare, eyeballs set in a gaunt skull, seeing and foreseeing things he cannot process.\n\nMatt Damon is the boorish Lt Gen Leslie Groves, Oppenheimer’s exasperated military minder; Kenneth Branagh is his genial scientific hero and mentor Niels Bohr; Robert Downey Jr is the duplicitous Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss; Florence Pugh plays his lover Jean Tatlock, whose heart he broke, while Emily Blunt is his wife, Kitty, also badly treated. Tom Conti plays the sorrowfully detached Albert Einstein, and it has to be said that Nolan, rightly or wrongly, uses non-Jewish actors for Oppenheimer and Einstein, two of the most famous Jewish people in history and in fact doesn’t quite get to grips with the antisemitism that Oppenheimer faced as an assimilated secular American Jew.\n\nAfter the first test, Oppenheimer is reported to have said ‘Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds’. Photograph: Melinda Sue Gordon/Universal Pictures\n\nThere is a horribly gripping scene showing Oppenheimer’s formative experience as an unhappy graduate student in England at Christ’s College, Cambridge. He suffered what amounted to a psychotic breakdown and left a poisoned apple on the desk of his testy supervisor Patrick Blackett (James D’Arcy), which Blackett fortunately didn’t notice and didn’t eat. Nolan coolly invites to see this as a parable for the lost Eden of a more innocent prewar physics, with Oppenheimer as a serpent with Adam’s foolish innocence. And of course there is the creeping biographical irony: how terribly close Oppenheimer came to … killing someone.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Film Weekly Free newsletter Take a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After the successful detonation of the Hiroshima bomb, Murphy shows us Oppenheimer in shock, but also realising he has to address an audience of cheering colleagues and subordinates. He knows it is his duty as a leader to congratulate them and be upbeat, stammering out some fatuous remark about how the Japanese “didn’t like it”, then realising how callous that was, and beginning to hallucinate the horror. Of course, Oppenheimer did not witness the actual use of his weapon, he never saw anything becoming death, the destroyer of worlds, and Nolan takes the decision to look away from it too, to stay in the US, to stay with Oppenheimer himself in all his sudden tragic irrelevance.\n\nPerhaps the film’s most important moment is the one that addresses its own flaw: the legendary postwar encounter in the White House Oval Office between Oppenheimer and President Harry S Truman (played by Gary Oldman), the man who took the final executive decision to drop the bomb. Nolan and Murphy show how Oppenheimer shrinks and cringes into the couch in front of him, like a scared little boy, apparently wanting something like absolution from the president and mumbling that he feels he has “blood on his hands”. Angry and baffled, Truman tells him curtly that all this is his responsibility as president and asks a very pertinent question: does Oppenheimer think the Japanese care who made the bomb? No, they want to know who dropped it. It’s true: concentrating on Oppenheimer is simultaneously fascinating and beside the larger historical point.\n\nIn the end, Nolan shows us how the US’s governing class couldn’t forgive Oppenheimer for making them lords of the universe, couldn’t tolerate being in the debt of this liberal intellectual. Oppenheimer is poignantly lost in the kaleidoscopic mass of broken glimpses: the sacrificial hero-fetish of the American century.\n\nOppenheimer is released on 20 July in Australia, and 21 July in the US and UK."

        "text": "“Barbenheimer” is officially here, and the battle that’s been referred to as the bomb versus bombshell is about to ignite the box office.\n\nGreta Gerwig’s cotton candy-colored “Barbie,” starring Margot Robbie as the plastic, fantastic doll, is expected to generate a huge $95 million to $110 million from 4,200 North American theaters over the weekend. Given the omnipresence of “Barbie” (the marketing is practically inescapable, with enough memes and marketing tie-ins to last a lifetime), initial estimates are all over the place. Warner Bros. is projecting a more conservative $75 million to start, while rivals and exhibitors believe the PG-13 movie could make as much as $140 million between Friday and Sunday.\n\nIn any case, “Barbie” will claim the top spot over Christopher Nolan‘s atomic bomb drama “Oppenheimer,” which is aiming to collect a solid $50 million from 3,600 cinemas through Sunday. Universal is backing the R-rated historical biopic, which cost $100 million.\n\n“Oppenheimer” runs at three hours (“Barbie” clocks in at just under two), which may limit the screenings per day. However, Nolan’s epic will benefit from premium large format screens like Imax, which is dedicating its entire footprint to his film for three weeks.\n\nTogether, the seemingly different blockbusters with twin release dates are fueling the phenomenon known as “Barbenheimer.” AMC Theatres, the nation’s biggest cinema chain, reported that 40,000 people have already purchased tickets for double features of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” on the same day — up 20,000 from last week.\n\nThe National Association of Theatre Owners, the industry’s trade organization, is projecting that more than 200,000 moviegoers will attend same-day viewings of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” at theaters across North America. And that’s “in addition to the millions of worldwide moviegoers who are planning to see both films on different days this weekend,” says Michael O’Leary, president and CEO of NATO.\n\nThe $145 million-budgeted “Barbie” stars too many A-listers to name, but we’ll give it a shot: Ryan Gosling, Issa Rae, Dua Lipa, Simu Liu, Helen Mirren, John Cena and Will Ferrell round out the cast of the fantasy comedy, which follows Barbie and Ken as they leave the comfort and familiarity of Barbie-Land on a quest for self-discovery in the real world.\n\n“Oppenheimer,” adapted by Nolan from the Pulitzer Prize-winning book “American Prometheus,” is an equally star-studded character study about theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. Cillian Murphy plays the man who led the development of the atomic bomb, alongside an ensemble of Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Alden Ehrenreich.\n\nThe potent combination of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” as well as last weekend’s champion “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” is expected to fuel one of the biggest box office weekends in ages. Summer season has otherwise produced a string of underperforming options, like “The Flash,” “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” and “Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken.”\n\nTom Cruise’s newest “Mission” looks to add $28 million to $30 million in its second weekend of release, a decline of roughly 50% from its debut. The seventh installment in Paramount and Skydance’s globe-trotting action franchise opened to $56 million in North America and $234 million globally. It cost $291 million before marketing, so Ethan Hunt’s latest death-defying adventure needs to remain a draw throughout the summer to justify that price tag.\n\nElsewhere, the unlikely box office hit “Sound of Freedom” is imminently crossing the $100 million mark, which will put the film among the top 16 highest grossing of the year. The low-budget, faith-based movie about child sex trafficking has generated a remarkable $85.7 million to date. That’s thanks mostly to the religious and conservative media groups that have rallied behind the film.\n\nPaul Dergarabedian, a senior Comscore analyst, calls “Barbenheimer” a “movie marketers dream come true.” He adds that the craze is “creating a rising tide of interest that should also boost the fortunes of ‘MI7’ and ‘Sound of Freedom’ as moviegoers flood the multiplex in search of movies to catch on the big screen.”"

        "text": "CNN —\n\n“The bomb, Dimitri. The hydrogen bomb,” an exasperated US president reminds his Soviet counterpart in Stanley Kubrick’s 1964 classic “Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.”\n\nAs if the bomb could ever be forgotten. At the height of the Cold War, when mutually assured destruction was at its crazed height, nuclear warfare found itself abstracted through humor – perhaps the only reasonable way to treat something so fearsome. The bomb was a sick joke to be ridden, sometimes metaphorically, sometimes literally, a totem of mankind’s ingenuity and stupidity riveted shut and let fly. To look at it head-on was to be blinded by its glare; the power it wrought was too absurd — and too close — to countenance. Best to send in the clowns.\n\nIt would have seemed inconceivable then, but the atomic bomb did fade out of mind. In the 21st Century, other existential threats have reared their heads. Yet the nuclear threat feels closer today than it has for generations. And it’s precisely at this moment that Christopher Nolan is asking audiences to look it soberly in the eye.\n\n“Our relationship with nuclear weapons is very complicated,” Nolan told CNN. “The fear ebbs and flows. It’s almost like humanity can only deal with one apocalypse at a time, and there’s so many issues to worry about.”\n\nBut worry many will after watching “Oppenheimer,” his latest and perhaps greatest film to date. As the name suggests, Nolan has taken on the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scientific genius and conflicted godfather of the atomic bomb. Working in IMAX, the director conjures an overwhelming, altogether haunting retelling of the story of the bomb’s creation and its fallout across three taut hours that pushes the limits of the medium itself.\n\nCillian Murphy as godfather of the atomic bomb J. Robert Oppenheimer in \"Oppenheimer.\" Universal Pictures\n\nNolan’s screenplay – written, unusually, in the first person – drew from definitive biography “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer” by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin, but stops short of its forensic take on the physicist. Flitting between color and monochrome – the director has described the former as a subjective and the latter an objective lens on events – we mostly experience the narrative through Oppenheimer’s eyes.\n\n“We have to get the facts right. We have to be guided by history. But we’re trying to give the audience an experience. We’re trying to really entertain and engage in a meaningful way,” Nolan explained.\n\n“It’s a subjective telling,” he added. “We’re trying to not judge the man. We’re trying to experience things with him and understand.”\n\nOppenheimer’s piercing blue stare is inhabited by Cillian Murphy, the director’s long-time collaborator and first-time leading man. “Oh, there was a man,” Murphy said of his character. “I was so exhilarated to be given the opportunity – it’s kind of a dream part. But it’s so multifaced and massive, so you just dive in.”\n\nMurphy plays Oppenheimer from a young student in Cambridge in the 1920s through to the post-war McCarthy era and beyond, without the aid of distracting de-aging CGI (the physicist died in 1967). Around him swirls a who’s who of impeccably suited scientists, military men and politicians, along with the women in his life, wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) and lover Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) – a vast supporting cast in the truest sense.\n\n“Watching Cillian and Chris together, it was two people at the height of their abilities,” said Matt Damon, who stars as Leslie Groves, the brusque general overseeing the Manhattan Project.\n\n“It felt the most like watching when Spielberg did ‘Saving Private Ryan,’” he added, “watching Chris Nolan with a story that’s worthy of his vast ability. Everybody could feel it, so everybody came with everything they had and was like, ‘Alright, how do we support this?’”\n\nA threat renewed\n\nFor most of Nolan’s considerable cast, Oppenheimer’s invention set the backdrop for their upbringings. “This was our existential threat growing up,” recalled Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and later a political operator.\n\n“We did grow up at this time, but it’s almost too much to engage with, so you push it out,” said Damon. “It’s like we’ve all been living under this sword of Damocles for 80 years … Our kids, it’s not part of their experience to the extent that it should be.”\n\nCillian Murphy alongside Christopher Nolan on the set of \"Oppenheimer.\" Melinda Sue Gordon/Universal Pictures\n\nNolan knows this only too well. “I told one of my teenage sons what I was working on,” he recalled. “He said to me, ‘Well, does anybody really worry about that anymore?’ This was a couple of years ago. By the time we finished shooting the film, unfortunately he wasn’t asking that question anymore.”\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine days before cameras started rolling, noted Murphy, and it was under that cloud that filming began in New Mexico, at a stand in for the Los Alamos HQ for the Manhattan Project.\n\nThe film has taken on troubling relevance, especially the passages set post-war, documenting an arms race that Oppenheimer warned against. Its examination of his legacy, from the physicist’s perspective and the people around him, forms a devastating and complex coda.\n\nRobert Downey Jr. in \"Oppenheimer \" Universal Pictures\n\nToday, the ethical debate surrounding the bomb remains undimmed. But even if a war involving a nuclear power hadn’t erupted in Europe in 2022, Nolan believes “Oppenheimer” contains crossover anxieties.\n\n“(Nuclear war) is unique in the threats that we face, but it also relates to a lot of our relationship – and particularly young people’s relationship – with technology and technological innovation,” he said. “Because ultimately, the atomic bomb, awful though it is and was, it was an incredible technological innovation.”\n\nEighty years after the Trinity Test, technological innovation looks like artificial intelligence (AI), he offered, and the potential dangers of “unleashing those things on the world.”\n\n“A lot of the scientists I speak to, a lot of the people who work in the tech sector I speak to, they worry about this,” he added. “They see what they’re doing as their Oppenheimer moment, and they look to his story to give some kind of guidance as to how the relationship between science, technology, government and society should function.\n\n“I don’t know whether Oppenheimer’s story has answers to that,” he added. “It certainly raises the questions, and in a way that I think we will find quite chilling.”\n\n\"A lot of the scientists I speak to ... they see what they're doing as their Oppenheimer moment,\" Nolan said of the rise of AI. Universal Pictures\n\nKubrick had us laugh at the bomb because it felt like an appropriate coping mechanism. Now Nolan’s fierce and sincere contemplation will awaken a new generation to its horrors – and that feels appropriate too.\n\nFor a director obsessed with the workings of time, the arrival of his latest movie is uncanny. But one senses the film will outlive this moment, and only burnish his reputation as one of the few blockbuster directors with the clout to pull off working at this scale.\n\n“There’s always been this mystique around Nolan,” Downey Jr. shared. “The spring-into-summer that the first ‘Iron Man’ came out (in 2008), people were like, ‘Oh, this will do until “The Dark Knight” comes out.’ So, you’re like, ‘Oh, it’s not a Chris Nolan.’”\n\n“He’s a master filmmaker, there’s no denying it,” he added, “and you don’t get many of those per generation.”\n\n“I think this film is kind of the apotheosis of his talent as a director,” said Murphy. “To have had the privilege of working with him over the years and seeing him move towards this, it’s phenomenal to witness.”\n\n“Oppenheimer” is released in cinemas in the US and UK on July 21."

He’s the Manhattan Project.\n\nDirectors Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach’s summer blockbuster Barbie (2023) is set to open in theaters on July 21, the same day as Christopher Nolan’s long-anticipated film Oppenheimer (2023), a movie about the development of the atomic bomb. Many theaters across the country are screening these polar opposite movies back-to-back, and the notion of a double feature has the internet in absolute shambles. So what better way to cope than with a deluge of absurdly dark memes?\n\nAn unedited still from the actual Barbie (2023) trailer that feels like it should be in Oppenheimer (2023) (screenshot Maya Pontone/Hyperallergic via Twitter)\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the dual blockbuster opening, people are preparing for the emotional wreckage that will undoubtedly besiege them from the confluence of these films. Notably, Christopher Nolan told Wired reporters that some early viewers of Oppenheimer (2023) “left the movie absolutely devastated,” which is, you know, super uplifting to hear.\n\nReal-life photographs of me after watching both films. (screenshot Maya Pontone/Hyperallergic via Twitter)\n\nThose who are seeing Oppenheimer (2023) before Barbie (2023) are calling the mash-up “Oppenbarbie,” and those who are wrong and seeing the films in the reverse order are calling it “Barbieheimer.”\n\nThis meme from The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent (2022) has yet to get old for me. (screenshot Maya Pontone/Hyperallergic via Twitter)\n\nLike many others on the internet, I have strong opinions about how theatergoers should spend the day. The following meme is giving “No sleep. Bus. Club. Another club. Another club. Plane. Next place. No sleep”:\n\nThe internet has opinions about how to spend the day. (screenshot Maya Pontone/Hyperallergic via Twitter)\n\nThe pairing of the two films has led some to make interesting observations of real-world phenomena that could fit the Barbie-Oppenheimer theme — such as this pair of surreal houses:\n\nAs they say, art imitates life. Or in this case, life imitates art? I don’t know anymore. (screenshot Maya Pontone/Hyperallergic via Twitter)\n\n… Or this strange pink cloud that’s either another hazardous “gender reveal” or (hopefully) an incredible PR stunt by the Barbie (2023) marketing team:\n\nAnother forest fire-causing gender reveal? Who knows! (screenshot Maya Pontone/Hyperallergic via Twitter)\n\nSpeaking of the Barbie (2023) marketing team, can we just take a moment to appreciate this bubble gum pink Xbox console? I, myself, was a Wii stan growing up, but even this video game set-up would have me begging my mom to drive me to the nearest Toys-R-Us. (RIP!)\n\nPlease, Mom? I need the Xbox Barbie Dream Edition. Everyone at school has one! (screenshot Maya Pontone/Hyperallergic via Instagram)\n\nOf course, this wouldn’t be a proper meme round-up if I didn’t include this spot-on Sopranos reference:\n\nThe real question is: Why isn’t Adriana in Barbie (2023)? (screenshot Maya Pontone/Hyperallergic via Twitter)\n\nIf New Jersey Italian mafia jokes aren’t your thing, perhaps this Avril Lavigne meme is. Can I make it any more obvious?\n\nHe was a skater boy. She said, “See ya later, boy.” (screenshot Maya Pontone/Hyperallergic via Twitter)\n\nBut whether you decide to see Barbie (2023) then Oppenheimer (2023), or Oppenheimer (2023) then Barbie (2023), just remember that David Lynch did it first.\n\nAn important observation about Wild At Heart (1990) and the Twin Peaks film Fire Walk With Me (1992). (screenshot Maya Pontone/Hyperallergic via Instagram)\n\nHappy watching, and good luck!"

Forgive our confusion because Jim Halpert (Krasinski) from the U.S. version of The Office pulled a fast one recently by photo bombing the Oppenheimer cast at the film's recent New York City press day. Of course, Krasinski gets access because his wife, Emily Blunt, co-stars as J. Robert Oppenheimer's (Cillian Murphy) wife, Katherine “Kitty” Oppenheimer.\n\nIt was actually Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss in the film, who posted the photo and added the cameo joke on his Instagram saying, “Wait, is that a Krasinski photobomb or might there be a surprise cameo???” Downey Jr. is joined by his fellow cast members Blunt, Cillian Murphy and Matt Damon. We do have to wonder if Krasinski brought the pizza and beers because that's definitely the smart way to crash a party.\n\nThe junket interviews signifies the official press push for the historical epic which opens exclusively in theaters and IMAX on July 21. Downey Jr. also shared that he and the cast are off to Paris, France next for a world premiere. And then they'll return back to the United States for the domestic premiere before it hits theaters.\n\nOppenheimer is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and the late Martin J. Sherwin. Shot in both black and white and color, Nolan recently revealed to AP that there's a method to that visual language, with the color sections reflecting the perspective of Murphy's Oppenheimer and the black and white reflecting the more dogmatic approach of Downey's anti-Communist character, Lewis Strauss.\n\nDespite the disappointment of presumably not getting some Krasinski face-time in a supporting role for Oppenheimer, we'll just indulge ourselves in imagining the mother of all Halpert-esque, straight-to-camera reactions when Oppenheimer gets the green-light to test the atomic bomb in the movie.\n\nOppenheimer arrives exclusively on the big screen Friday, July 21 in a number of different formats.

        "text": "The release of the Oppenheimer film, and the wave of (media) attention surrounding it, creates an opportunity to spark public attention on the risks of nuclear weapons and invite new audiences to get involved in the movement to abolish nuclear weapons. We can educate about the risks, and share a much-needed message of hope and resistance: Oppenheimer is about how nuclear weapons began, the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) is how we end them. That is why we have put together some resources for all ICAN campaigners - or anyone who is willing to take action- to use at local theatres around the world or to join the conversation online!\n\nWhat stand does the movie take on nuclear weapons?\n\nWe don’t know yet, we will update you once the film has been released. Until the movie comes out, we won’t know many details about the position the movie will take on nuclear weapons, beyond the trailer and the fact that the movie is based Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin’s biography of Robert J. Oppenheimer, “American Prometheus.” While initial interviews with the director and cast seem to hint at a real concern about nuclear weapons, mirroring some of Oppenheimer’s own concerns, there is also risk that the movie ends up being ‘bomb porn’ that glorifies the development of nuclear weapons undermining the dangers of their production and use, or that the discourse centres only around the technical production of the movie, or that it leaves out a crucial part of this story: the catastrophic humanitarian impact of the weapon that Oppenheimer created.\n\nBut no matter what the movie shows, it is sparking a bump in social media conversations and online searches for more information about Oppenheimer, nuclear weapons, Trinity, the Manhattan Project, etc. That is why we have collected key talking points and background information on those impacts, and the risks of nuclear weapons below.\n\nFlyers\n\nWe know there are organisations already planning large-scale events that combine (private) screenings with panels or Q&As with experts on nuclear disarmament, but that is not the only way to take in person action. Flyering or offering yourself to do a 'talkback' at your local cinema after the show is a great way to engage movie-goers who have questions. We have created some useful materials you can easily print as flyers or postcards.\n\nSocial Media Materials\n\nWe have created a series of social media materials you can share to your organisation’s account, though some may only be relevant once the movie is out. You can download them (zip) here or you can find the Canva template, for translations, here.\n\nYou can also encourage your supporters to share their own post by here: https://amplify.icanw.org/campaign/25773327-E379-4DBC-895A-8C96420F8B71 or if you would like to embed these one-click-share posts directly on your site, please get in touch with Lucero.\n\nGetting into local media\n\nIt may be possible to interest local media in our messaging around Oppenheimer in two ways\n\nIf you are planning any actions around Cinemas or your own public screenings of the film, you should issue a media advisory in advance to your local print/online, TV and radio outlets telling them what you will be doing so they can cover it if they want to.\n\nOnce you have seen the film, you could write a letter to the editor of the local newspaper.\n\nMedia advisory template\n\nYOUR LOGO\n\nMedia advisory\n\nHeadline (this should say simply and succinctly what you will doing eg XXXX will be engaging with audiences at the showing of Oppenheimer at XXXX cinema about the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons)\n\nYOUR LOCATION, DATE 2023\n\n(Here you put details of what you are doing in a maximum of 2 short paragraphs)\n\nFor more information contact:\n\nYOUR NAME AND CONTACT DETAILS\n\nAbout (name of your organisation)\n\n(here you can put some information about your organisation)\n\nTemplate: Letter to the Editor\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nI just saw the new Oppenheimer film, and, combined with increased reporting about Russian nuclear threats and rising nuclear tensions on the Korean peninsula, I wanted to share a note of optimism with others who may have left the film shaken by, or questioning, what they have seen..\n\nFirst, there’s now a treaty that makes nuclear weapons, and everything to do with them, illegal. It’s the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons that came into force in 2021, and it’s already been signed by almost half of all UN members.\n\nSecond, the Nobel Prize-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) has transformed the anti-nuclear movement and provided a place for anyone- from members of parliament to city councillors to individual citizens like me - to get involved in ending all nuclear threats. This campaign is open to everyone, and as the film so poignantly reminded us, it’s everyone’s responsibility to do what they can to save the world.\n\nOppenheimer is about how nuclear weapons began; but now I’m glad to be part of the way nuclear weapons will end.\n\nSincerely,\n\nXXXX\n\nBackground:\n\nFacts & Myths about nuclear weapons (and other questions raised by the movie)\n\nWhile the movie has not been released yet, we expect the interest in the movie will raise questions about nuclear weapons and resurface some problematic, yet frequently heard myths. That is why we have prepared an in-depth guide to tackle questions like: nuclear weapons ended WWII (or prevent war), nuclear deterrence means they’ll never get used, so there’s no problem, and so on. We will be updating this FAQ as more becomes known about the movie’s stance.\n\nhttps://www.icanw.org/oppenheimer_facts_myths_nuclear_weapons\n\nOn Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project\n\nWho was Oppenheimer? Robert Oppenheimer was an American theoretical physicist. He was the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II, and is often credited as the \"father of the atomic bomb\" for his role in the Manhattan Project, the research and development undertaking that created the first nuclear weapons.\n\nDid Oppenheimer oppose nuclear weapons? Oppenheimer did not explicitly criticise the use of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. However in October 1945 he met President Truman to urge him to turn nuclear weapons over to international control in order to avoid a nuclear arms race, something Truman was unwilling to do. After the war, Oppenheimer joined the US Atomic Energy Commission which was set up to regulate the development of nuclear technology. In his capacity of Chair of the Commission he advocated for the development of low yield nuclear weapons and unsuccessfully opposed the development of the H-bomb and then fell foul of the anti-communist purges of the early 1950s and lost his security clearance and his role on the Commission. Later in his life, he avoided joining calls for nuclear disarmament despite being invited to do so.\n\nWhat was the Manhattan Project? In 1942, the Manhattan Project was established, with its first offices at 270 Broadway in Manhattan, thereby giving it the name the Manhattan Project. The project continued and expanded employing up to 130,000 people at numerous facilities.\n\nWhat did other Manhattan Project Scientists say about nuclear weapons? Joseph Rotblat was the only Manhattan Project Scientist that left the project after it was clear that Germany wasn’t building nuclear weapons. The 1995 Nobel Peace Prize went to Joseph Rotblat and Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs \"for their efforts to diminish the part played by nuclear arms in international politics and, in the longer run, to eliminate such arms”. In a memo on the eve of the Trinity test, four Manhattan Project scientists could not agree if this new weapon should ever be used in war - or whether it should be technically demonstrated and then eliminated.\n\nOn the Trinity Test and its impacts\n\nThe Trinity test (shown in the film)\n\nThe Trinity Test was conduced on July 16th 1945 at Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range, in New Mexico, United States. As the scientists behind the Manhattan project tested the first ever nuclear weapon, the “Gadget”, safety came second: the fallout zone was dramatically underestimated, the effects were barely studied, and no one was evacuated.\n\nThe communities of the Trinity fallout zone call themselves the ‘Tularosa Basin Downwinders’ because radiation was carried downwind from the test site to their communities. Residents were not told about the test even as fallout ‘snowed’ over their farms, homes, and wells. The damage became clear almost immediately. In the months following Trinity (Aug, Sept, and Oct of 1945) infant mortality in New Mexico increased by 56%, many as a result of rare birth defects. Ionising radiation is particularly damaging to rapidly developing and dividing cells—affecting infants, children, and pregnant women. But when authorities were alerted, nothing happened. The Downwinders were left to deal with a devastating legacy of health and environmental impacts for decades and have advocated for justice and compensation since.

        "text": "Photos courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures; Melinda Sue Gordon/Universal Pictures\n\nOne of the most hotly debated head-to-head box office match-ups of the year is just four weeks away. While much could change over the next month, here’s how Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer are shaping up in preliminary tracking.\n\nBarbie\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures\n\nJuly 21, 2023 (WIDE)\n\nOpening Weekend Range: $55M-$85M\n\nDomestic Total Range: $120M-$226M\n\nPROS:\n\nBarbie has been a remarkable performer across the social media spectrum thanks to a vocal fan base and meme-driven activity across TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and other platforms.\n\nAs a generational brand, Barbie has strong appeal to women of various ages and should benefit from the voice of director and co-writer Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird, Little Women) and the presence of A-Listers Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as the leads.\n\nOutside of The Little Mermaid, very few of this summer’s tentpole films are catering so directly to women, leaving Barbie positioned for a strong performance courting an under-served audience. Early sales reflect this with, with Barbie’s day-one pre-sales coming in 46 percent higher than Mermaid‘s comparable period.\n\nCONS:\n\nIt’s challenging at this stage to determine to what extent online and fandom buzz will translate to real world interest. That’s especially true given the film’s seemingly more mature focus; its satirical comedy bent could put a ceiling on family turnout relative to the broader multi-generational appeal of The Super Mario Bros. Movie.\n\nPremium screen footprints will be very low for Barbie, with other films dominating that space throughout July. That not only lowers Barbie‘s potential average ticket prices, but—as audiences increasingly favor a premium viewing experience—could have a negative impact on attendance.\n\nWhile early pre-sales are strong for previews on Wednesday and Thursday, it remains to be seen whether or not the film will be able to gain traction outside the die-hard fan base in the weeks ahead.\n\nOppenheimer\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\nJuly 21, 2023 (WIDE)\n\nOpening Weekend Range: $40M-$55M\n\nDomestic Total Range: $137M-$187M\n\nPROS:\n\nDirector Christopher Nolan himself is a reliable box office draw, as shown in the post-Dark Knight era of his career with the success of Dunkirk, Interstellar, and Inception.\n\nCounter-programming potential is strong, with Oppenheimer being one of the few thrillers aimed squarely at adults to receiving a massive marketing push in this day and age.\n\nThere’s minimal direct competition moving into the late summer, with most of the wide releases coming to theaters in Oppenheimer‘s first few holdover frames being family-friendly movies.\n\nPre-sales are popping at this stage, with initial models pointing to preview results ahead of last summer’s Nope and Nolan’s own Dunkirk. General moviegoer interest prompted by strong word of mouth from preview audiences could create long-term backloading weeks into the film’s theatrical run—particularly as many seek out IMAX and other PLFs for this particular film.\n\nCONS:\n\nOppenheimer‘s three-hour runtime puts even more emphasis on word of mouth—especially given the fact that, while containing a spectacle component, it looks to be Nolan’s most strictly narrative-driven film since The Prestige in 2006.\n\nMen over the age of 25 will be the primary crowd here, and that’s a source of crossover competition with Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, opening one week earlier.\n\nNolan’s Tenet, released under abnormal pandemic-era circumstances, was one of the more divisive films of his career, earning a 76 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nLong Range Box Office Forecast & 2023’s Upcoming Calendar\n\n(as of 6/23/23)\n\nRelease Date Title 3-Day (FSS) Opening Low/High Range Pinpoint % Chg from Last Week Domestic Total Low/High Range Pinpoint % Chg from Last Week Distributor 6/30/2023 Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny $68,000,000 – $95,000,000 -9% $211,000,000 – $325,000,000 Disney / Lucasfilm 6/30/2023 Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken $12,000,000 – $17,000,000 -10% $35,000,000 – $62,000,000 -10% Universal / DreamWorks Animation 7/7/2023 Insidious: The Red Door $24,000,000 – $29,000,000 -7% $54,000,000 – $66,000,000 -7% Sony Pictures / Screen Gems 7/7/2023 Joy Ride $11,000,000 – $16,000,000 -10% $35,000,000 – $60,000,000 -10% Lionsgate 7/12/2023 Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One $65,000,000 – $80,000,000 $250,000,000 – $320,000,000 Paramount Pictures 7/14/2023 PSYCHO-PASS: Providence (Limited) Sony / Crunchyroll 7/14/2023 Theater Camp (Limited) Disney / Searchlight Pictures 7/21/2023 Barbie $55,000,000 – $85,000,000 $120,000,000 – $226,000,000 Warner Bros.

The event will include exhibits, such as the J. Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Committee Oppenheimer installation – a collaboration with the Los Alamos History Museum and Los Alamos National Lab (LANL); an immersive installation of Oppenheimer’s living room with set pieces from the Oppenheimer movie, courtesy of NBC Universal and the Los Alamos History Museum; Bradbury Science Museum will have their Fat Man replica on site and the Los Alamos Historical Society will have the General’s car; and science and Oppenheimer merchandise will be available from Gadget’s Store and artist Brenda Fleming. Live music, an artist demo and food and drinks from Señor Tortas and Bathtub Row Brewing Co-op will round off the experience and provide an atmosphere to mingle and celebrate the long-awaited release of the movie.\n\nThe public is also invited to join a panel discussion in the Social Center from 3-4 p.m. The discussion will highlight Los Alamos: History, Present and Future, featuring:\n\nWilliam I. White, Senior Advisor for Department of Energy Environmental Management,\n\nWendy Behrman, National Parks Service Manhattan Project National Historic Park Superintendent\n\nNancy Bartlit, WWII Historian and Author\n\nModerator: Don Cobb, retired, Los Alamos National Laboratory\n\nAlso available to the public, SALA’s Roxy Theater will highlight “Insights from Documentaries” featuring The Moment in Time: The Manhattan Project at 3:30 p.m.\n\nAlthough the Manhattan Film Series showing at 6 p.m. and the Oppenheimer showings at 5 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. are for ticket holders only, the public is welcome to come to the “Main Gate” ticket booth to pick up their free visitor pass and enjoy everything else going on at SALA, exhibits, panel discussions, and documentaries.\n\nThe festivities will continue after July 20. SALA is continuing the exhibits and activities for a 10-day Oppenheimer Festival, along with the ability to purchase tickets to the long-awaited Christopher Nolan Oppenheimer movie. A full schedule of events is available on the SALA website.\n\n“After months of waiting, the movie is finally here. Team Oppie partnered with local and regional stakeholders to create opportunities for collaboration, and help local businesses and organizations develop unique “Oppenheimer” experiences, products, programming, or attractions,” said Asst. Public Information Officer, Leslie Bucklin, “The Premiere Event is a time to celebrate how far we have come.” “Project Oppenheimer,” an initiative started in January 2023, recognized the big screen has landed Los Alamos on the big stage, providing a unique opportunity to create an environment open to visitors, building curiosity and cultivating relationships to share the “real” Los Alamos, no matter the pre-existing perception. Los Alamos is working as a community to provide ways for visitors to learn the true stories behind the historic events featured in the Oppenheimer film. Bucklin notes that the impact the community will feel because of Nolan’s movie may just be getting started.\n\n“Although we have seen a significant increase in interest in the local history, I believe curiosity and inquiries into Los Alamos will grow much more over the next year, after the movie is released,” Bucklin said.\n\nFor more information about all things Oppenheimer, including links to the Manhattan Project National Historical Park and LANL pages and tours, a calendar of events, education resources, local offerings, feature articles about Los Alamos and J. Robert Oppenheimer, and much more, the County has created a host website, which continues to grow as more resources become available: www.lacnm.com/Oppie.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading..."

        "text": "Is there such thing as a sympathetic cause for treason?\n\nMagnolia Pictures documentary “A Compassionate Spy,” directed by two-time Oscar nominee Steve James (“Hoop Dreams,” “Life Itself”), captures the controversial true story of Manhattan Project physicist Ted Hall. Part of the team behind J. Robert Oppenheimer’s atomic bomb, Hall shared nuclear secrets with the Soviet Union. The documentary is told through the perspective of Ted’s wife Joan Hall, who protected his secret across their 50-year marriage.\n\nThe official “Compassionate Spy” synopsis reads: Recruited in 1944 as an 18-year-old Harvard undergraduate to help J. Robert Oppenheimer and his team create a bomb, Ted Hall was the youngest physicist on the Manhattan Project, and didn’t share his colleagues’ elation after the successful detonation of the world’s first atomic bomb. Concerned that a U.S. post-war monopoly on such a powerful weapon could lead to nuclear catastrophe, Hall began passing key information about the bomb’s construction to the Soviet Union. After the war, he met, fell in love with, and married Joan, a fellow student with whom he shared a passion for classical music and socialist causes — and the explosive secret of his espionage. The pair raised a family while living under a cloud of suspicion and years of FBI surveillance and intimidation.\n\n“A Compassionate Spy” premiered at the 2022 Venice Film Festival ahead of its North American launch at Telluride. The film is distributed by Magnolia Pictures and will be released on the heels of Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer,” which fictionalizes the creation of the bomb itself. “Oppenheimer” will be released in theaters July 21 and used real scientists in Los Alamos as extras.\n\n“We have to be really on our game, we have to be faithful to the history here, and really know what we’re up to,” director Christopher Nolan explained, citing that the first explosion of the atomic bomb in the Trinity test will be shown onscreen in the upcoming film sans CGI.\n\nIndieWire’s David Ehrlich wrote in the review for “A Compassionate Spy” that the harrowing true story is completely separate from “Oppenheimer.”\n\n“[Director] James doesn’t have access to the same toolkit on a low-budget documentary that someone like Christopher Nolan might have at his disposal while making an $100 million biopic about Robert Oppenheimer,” Ehrlich penned.\n\nHe added that “A Compassionate Spy” is “extremely sympathetic toward Hall’s choice,” with director James classifying Ted Hall’s as the “lesser of two evils” when it comes to the international nuclear arms race today. Ehrlich wrote, “The rabid nationalism that might convince some modern viewers to see Hall as a villain is exactly what scared him into contacting the Soviets.”\n\n“A Compassionate Spy” is presented by Participant and is a Mitten Media and Kartemquin Films production produced by Mark Mitten p.g.a., Dave Lindorff, and Steve James. Executive producers are Jeff Skoll, Diane Weyermann, Tim Horsburgh and Gordon Quinn.\n\n“A Compassionate Spy” premieres in theaters and on VOD August 4. Check out the trailer and poster below."

        "text": "UPDATE, 11:44 am PST: Christopher Nolan confirmed before the beginning of the “Oppenheimer” screening that the cast has left in solidarity with the SAG-AFTRA strike.\n\nPREVIOUSLY: Matt Damon has revealed that the “Oppenheimer” cast discussed their strike strategy before hitting the movie’s red carpet premiere in London on Thursday.\n\n“We talked about it,” Damon told Variety on the carpet. “Look, if it’s called now, everyone’s going to walk obviously in solidarity … Once the strike is officially called, [we’re walking]. That’s why we moved this [red carpet] up because we know the second it’s called, we’re going home.”\n\nDamon added: “We gave the strike authorization. We voted 98% to 2% to do that because we know our leadership has our best interest at heart.”\n\n“It’s really about working actors,” he continued. “It’s $26,000 to qualify for health coverage and a lot of people are on the margins and residual payments are getting them across that threshold. This isn’t an academic exercise. This is real life and death stuff. Hopefully we get to a resolution quickly. No one wants a work stoppage, but we’ve got to get a fair deal.”\n\nThe London carpet for Christopher Nolan’s atomic bomb thriller kicked off just before 5 p.m. local time, with a lot of nervous publicists and marketing executives looking anxiously at their phones and watches. In the event of an early strike, sources told Variety that the entire cast planned to discreetly exit the carpet in Leicester Square.\n\nEmily Blunt told Variety: “Obviously we stand with all of the actors and at whatever point it’s called, we’re going to be going home and standing together through it because I want everyone to get a fair deal.”\n\nAsked whether she’ll be joining the picket line herself, the British star quipped, “Oh, I think so!” before being rushed down the line by her publicist.\n\nKenneth Branagh, who plays physicist Niels Bohr in the film, also spoke to Variety about his feelings on the strike.\n\n“There are a lot of people here we did not want to disappoint, but we’re also in complete solidarity with our colleagues and what they’re doing,” he said. “I know they’ve worked diligently to achieve an agreement which is happening at a critical point in our industry. It’s important that we’re ready to be shoulder-to-shoulder with them as the situation develops.”\n\nNolan also spoke to Variety on the carpet about the film’s runtime, which is listed as three hours.\n\n“The runtime is two minutes shorter than ‘Avengers: Endgame,’ so we cling to that,” he said. “I said to [producer] Emma Thomas very early on that it’s going to be a three-hour film. I have to write a script that reflects that. That was our conversation with the studio. It’s a big story and needs a big talent. It’s a 180-page script and it’s a 180-minute movie.”\n\nAsked how Nolan feels about the movie’s release in Japan, which is still not confirmed, and whether he’d like that country’s audiences to view the film, the director said he wanted “Oppenheimer” to have the “widest audience around the world as it can” but that “films don’t come out everywhere all at the same time, so we’re waiting to see what happens with the other markets.”\n\nThe cast worked the carpet for the better part of an hour before wrapping around 6 p.m. for group photos. Rami Malek, who was stuck in traffic heading over to central London from a shoot, missed the red carpet entirely, but arrived at the 11th hour and hurried onto the carpet for photos.\n\nThe cast was expected to attend screenings of the film following the red carpet, but instead left the event in support of the actors strike. Universal held two separate screenings for “Oppenheimer” — one in Leicester Square and another at BFI Imax in Waterloo (which Variety attended). Nolan attended the Leicester Square premiere first, where he revealed the cast had left in support of the strike, and then headed to the BFI venue, where he made the same speech to the audience.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story erroneously quoted Christopher Nolan saying that “Oppenheimer” was budgeted at $180 million. The director, who was referring to the movie’s runtime, said 180 minutes."

        "text": "Just as actors are congregating on the picket line in Los Angeles for the first time in more than 40 years, audiences are flocking to the cinemas to see their films in unprecedented post-pandemic numbers.\n\nTom Cruise’s new film, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One has beaten its own franchise record this week, making $15.5m on its opening day of release, including $7m in the US; a million more than the sixth instalment managed over the same time period in 2018.\n\nBy releasing early in the week, Paramount’s blockbuster extends its “opening weekend” numbers over five days – a tactic also employed by some recent James Bond films to boost numbers. Predictions suggest Mission: Impossible’s final audience figures on Sunday will be around $95m in the US and $160m internationally.\n\nSuch numbers would mean the tentpole release would recoup much of its $290m budget before it’s been out for a week, and mean Cruise is likely to repeat last year’s trick of re-energising the Covid-battered box office. Top Gun: Maverick, his belated sequel to the 80s aviators hit, took $1.5bn in 2022 and was credited by many, including Steven Spielberg, with saving the cinematic experience.\n\nGlowing reviews and energetic marketing – focusing on why the new film’s spectacular stunts are best seen on a big screen – are expected to help Cruise’s latest follow suit.\n\nSuch a strong start was, however, also enjoyed by the latest Indiana Jones film, which took $60m on its opening day two weeks ago ahead of a $130m opening weekend. Yet the film then sputtered and is currently on $250m – $50m shy of its budget.\n\nYet worse returns have been clocked for Pixar’s Elemental and DC superhero movie The Flash, both of which were held in high hopes by their studios.\n\nDisappointing … The Flash has underperformed. Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/Alamy\n\nThe new Mission: Impossible has a week and a half to dominate cinemas before the double-headed threat of Barbie and Oppenheimer. Both Greta Gerwig’s perky comedy and Christopher Nolan’s epic atomic-bomb drama are released worldwide on 21 July, and buzz around their battle has boosted pre-sales for both.\n\nCruise has professed enthusiasm rather than anxiety about the looming competition, declaring that he has bought tickets for Oppenheimer next Friday and Barbie the following day.\n\nAMC cinemas in the US said that at least 20,000 of its members had booked to see both films on the same day, and many exhibitors globally are promoting the concept of this unlikely double bill.\n\nEven without such smart marketing, both Barbie and Oppenheimer are being sold as “event cinema”. Barbie is billed as best seen en masse and, perhaps, after having visited the cinema’s licensed concession stand.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Film Weekly Free newsletter Take a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Tristan Fewings/Getty Images for Warner Bros.\n\nOppenheimer, meanwhile, was shot on Imax, and as with many of Nolan’s films, audiences are strongly encouraged to see it on Imax screens – or, at least, the very largest possible. The film’s un-family friendly subject matter, as well as its R-rating in the US, may however limit its final takings. Tracking for Oppenheimer’s opening weekend currently stands as $43m in the US while Barbie’s is more than double, at $93m.\n\nBookmakers William Hill said on Friday that Barbie was 3/1 to become the highest-grossing film the year, with only The Super Mario Bros Movie (1/4) ahead of it in the betting.\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One was 10/1 with forthcoming superhero movie The Marvels down to 14/1.\n\nTom Cruise’s Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part 1 is also amongst the frontrunners at 10/1, with The Marvels (14/1) likewise in the reckoning. Dark horse Wonka came in at 33/1: the first trailer for Paul (Paddington) King’s origins story about Willy Wonka starring Timothée Chalamet was warmly received earlier this week.\n\nReviews for Barbie are embargoed until midnight BST on 18 July, with Oppenheimer at 5pm the following day."

Robert Oppenheimer and his team of scientists who helped build the world’s first atomic bombs during World War II.

        "text": "Tom Cruise really wants you to go see Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. And Barbie. And Oppenheimer.\n\nDespite his own blockbuster opening in a few weeks (that would be Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One), Cruise is urging his fans to check out the summer movie competition.\n\n“This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters,” Cruise wrote on Instagram post (below) that showed him standing with his Dead Reckoning writer-director Christopher McQuarrie in front of posters for Indy 5. “These are just a few that we can’t wait to see on the big screen.”\n\n“Congratulations, Harrison Ford, on 40 years of Indiana Jones and creating one of the most iconic characters in cinema history,” he continued. “You have given us countless hours of joy.”\n\n“I love a double feature, and it doesn’t get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig’s Barbie.”\n\nThe messaging suggests Cruise is once again hoping to save the summer box office — this time by bringing along a few other titles.\n\nLast year, the massive success of Top Gun: Maverick (which made $1.5 billion globally) was credited as “saving Hollywood’s ass” by no less than Steven Spielberg himself.\n\nThis year, a few films have struggled to gain box office traction — such as The Flash and Elemental — though Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse successfully popped.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is facing headwinds with modest reviews, yet is tracking to open with a solid $60 million to $70 million over the June 30-July 2 weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, Dead Reckoning is headed toward a franchise-best $90 million opening for its extended weekend, which gets underway Wednesday, July 12.\n\nThere’s no tracking yet for Barbie or Oppenheimer, which open head-to-head July 21, but both are considered highly anticipated — though, with respect to Cruise, would likely make for a rather odd back-to-back viewing experience.\n\nThe move follows a viral report from Puck that a “pissed” Cruise was had loudly complained to Paramount executives about the impact of Oppenheimer’s IMAX deal. Cruise was reportedly upset that IMAX was going to boot Dead Reckoning from its large-format screens after just one week in order to make room for its prior commitment to run Oppenheimer — which was entirely shot in the IMAX format – for three weeks.\n\n— Pamela McClintock contributed to this report"

        "text": "Christopher Nolan cast his eldest daughter in a gruesome role for his forthcoming feature “Oppenheimer.”\n\nSpeaking with the Telegraph, Nolan revealed that his daughter, Flora, visited the “Oppenheimer” set, alongside his wife and producer Emma Thomas, while the film was still in production. Nolan then had the idea to cast Flora in a then-open role: a nameless young woman who has her face damaged by a nuclear explosion in a sequence within the main character’s mind.\n\n“We needed someone to do that small part of a somewhat experimental and spontaneous sequence,” Nolan said. “So it was wonderful to just have her sort of roll with it.”\n\nNolan recognized the peculiarity of the casting, revealing that it was a decision that came quickly and one that was not premeditated: “Truthfully, I try not to analyze my own intentions.”\n\nHe explained that the casting further illustrates the theme of “Oppenheimer” at large: “But the point is that if you create the ultimate destructive power it will also destroy those who are near and dear to you. I suppose this was my way of expressing that in what, to me, were the strongest possible terms.”\n\nNolan also joked that the casting somewhat resembled a role in Michael Powell’s 1960 horror classic “Peeping Tom,” in which the English director cast his young son as the childhood version of a serial killer.\n\n“Oppenheimer” explores the creation of the atomic bomb during World War II, an effort spearheaded by J. Robert Oppenheimer and the U.S. military. The epic-length feature sports an all-star cast including Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Robert Downey Jr., amongst others. Universal Pictures is releasing the film to theaters on July 21."

Following the, let’s be honest, stunning news that Vietnam has banned the movie and reports that the Philippines might do the same, Greta Gerwig’s upcoming Barbie has firmly established itself as the dominant political touchstone of the season.\n\nYes, really.\n\nVietnam’s decision to ban commercial screenings of the Warner Bros. movie — which were set to begin July 21 — is, according to a statement given by the country’s Department of Cinema to the Washington Post, due to the appearance of a map in the movie that appears to depict China’s disputed territorial claims in the South China Sea — a claim also made by a number of other countries, notably including Vietnam and the Philippines.\n\nIn a statement explaining the banning of the movie, Vi Kien Thanh, head of the Department of Cinema, said that the movie featured an “offensive scene that shows the cow tongue line,” which would appear to be a reference to the so-called “nine-dash line,” the name given to China’s visual depiction of the disputed territory.\n\nThe scene has proven to be similarly controversial in the Philippines, with multiple local politicians weighing in on the topic. “If the invalidated nine-dash line was indeed depicted in the movie Barbie, then it is incumbent upon the [Movie and Television Review and Classification Board] to ban the same as it denigrates Philippine sovereignty,” Senator Francis Tolentino told CNN. “The movie is fiction, and so is the nine-dash line,” argued Senator Risa Hontiveros in her own video statement, adding, “At the minimum, our cinemas should include an explicit disclaimer that the nine-dash line is a figment of China’s imagination.”\n\nUltimately, the movie was permitted for release in the Phillipines, with the controversial map reportedly being blurred to obscure the map.\n\nSo far, Warner Bros. has yet to comment on the matter.\n\nBarbie isn't the first unexpected movie to get into hot water over the nine-dash line; both Sony's 2022 video game adaptation Uncharted and DreamWorks' 2019 animated kids movie Abominable faced similar bans, while the 2018 comedy Crazy Rich Asians cut a brief glimpse of a map to avoid the same fate.\n\nSomewhere, Robert Oppenheimer is smiling, if somewhat confused that Barbie, of all things, is causing all this trouble.\n\nBarbie will be released July 21. Buy tickets on Fandango or Atom Tickets.\n\nOppenheimer might have lost the political battle, but will it win the watching war? Have your say in our poll right here."

        "text": "Director Christopher Nolan’s latest feature Oppenheimer takes us into the tremendous yet troubled mind of physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), exploring the events of his life and the crucial role he played in the development of the atomic bomb. Always standing by his side throughout every battle (whether that be at the Los Alamos facility or at a tense hearing) is wife Kitty, played by the ever brilliant Emily Blunt.\n\nThe fierce Kitty Oppenheimer isn’t there to hold her husband’s hand. Instead, she is the driving force. Kitty repeatedly uses the word \"fight\" in her conversations with Oppenheimer, continually urging him to push forward in not only his work on the Manhattan Project, but in his later clashes with politicians. \"Why won’t you fight?\" Blunt’s Kitty firmly asks, not through exasperation but instead passion, being Oppenheimer’s biggest champion. She isn’t exactly frustrated by Oppenheimer’s sometimes unwillingness to stand up for himself, Kitty detests the way the world is treating her husband, and what that is turning him into.\n\nFor Blunt, this is what is behind Kitty’s tenacity here, as she explained to GamesRadar+: \"I think she believes in him and in his intentions, and I think she loathes seeing him dragged across the coals for their whole life, which is for public consumption. She believes that it is wrong and she knows who is the villain behind it, she has this surety about her whilst he is passive. That definitely incentivises her to push him further because he seems to be taking it as if he’s atoning for the sins of what he’s done and created. It’s really that she’s firing against his passive nature.\"\n\n(Image credit: Universal)\n\nIn fact, one of the highlights of the film sees Kitty fight against the politicians with all that she has during Oppenheimer’s hearing, essentially giving them a piece of her mind. She’s certainly a fierce character, but beneath that are vulnerabilities as we see Kitty struggle with the likes of addiction and motherhood, complexities Blunt explores beautifully. The actor is surprised then when we mention that Nolan has often drawn criticism for his female characters, with these commentators often citing the dead wives of his filmography and suggesting that the women are regularly sidelined.\n\nIt’s one of the best parts that anyone has ever written for me\n\nResponding with her thoughts on this, Blunt emphasises how Kitty is one of the best roles she has ever played: \"I mean - it’s one of the best parts that anyone has ever written for me. Not that he wrote it for me, but he wrote an exquisite part that is so layered. Even though she’s not a huge part, it packs a punch. I was so excited by her. And the thing that I love is that he wasn’t concerned with her being likeable, it was just a very real interpretation of the character. When you read about her in the book, they say that 'Kitty didn’t do small talk she only did big talk' which is so symbolic of the character. I really remember reading that and thinking, ‘that’s it, she’s so clear’. Usually I think women in movies have to be sort of quite likeable and warm, but she wasn’t either of those things, and he was unafraid of that and writing her as such. I just loved her.\"\n\nWill the part of Kitty Oppenheimer change the minds of Nolan's naysayers? Well, only time will tell, but one thing is certain - this Kitty has claws.\n\nOppenheimer releases in UK and US cinemas on July 21. For more on the film, you can read our interviews with director Christopher Nolan and actor Matt Damon, and listen to the latest episode of the Inside Total Film podcast for our chat with Cillian Murphy and more Nolan.\n\nIn the meantime, check out our guide to the rest of the most exciting upcoming movies in 2023 and beyond."

        "text": "“Oppenheimer” is the biopic only Christopher Nolan could make, a three-hour experience with the ability to hold your gaze — and your full attention — while the fury of its sound rattles the theater auditorium in which you sit.\n\nThe director of “Dunkirk,” “Inception,” “Tenet” and several other noteworthy films, Nolan is both the director and writer of the film, adapting it from Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s 2005 Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer.”\n\nHe offers a deep dive into the psyche of the theoretical physicist who led the U.S. government’s Manhattan Project during World War II and became known as “the father of the atomic bomb,” an examination that at times is served with near-nuclear force.\n\nIt is incredible.\n\nCillian Murphy — who has appeared in numerous Nolan films, including “The Dark Knight” Trilogy, but has never been front and center — portrays the titular figure with a steady and subtle touch. It is not a performance characterized by big, emotional speeches but instead by myriad science-based conversations, many regarding the physical fate of the world.\n\nThere exists, Oppenheimer comes to learn, a “near-zero” chance the detonation of an atomic will ignite the atmosphere, ending all life on Earth.\n\nNolan is most interested in the conflict Oppenheimer feels, more strongly at times than others, about achieving a great scientific breakthrough but one with the power to take so much life even in the event all goes as designed. A Jewish man, he mainly sells himself on the idea that the U.S. must beat Nazi Germany to the development of a weapon of such mass destruction.\n\nEven at 180 minutes, “Oppenheimer” has no time for its subject’s childhood, instead taking us on a largely but certainly not wholly linear journey — this is Nolan, after all — from the early part of Oppenheimer’s career to the scientist’s controversial years that followed the detonation by the U.S. of atomic bombs over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nNolan introduces us to numerous figures from Oppenheimer’s work and personal lives, and you’ll likely struggle to keep track of them all.\n\nThere are the scientists — mainly men, portrayed by, among others, Josh Harnett, Rami Malek, Kenneth Branagh, Benny Safdie, David Krumholtz, Jack Quaid, Danny Deferrari and Tom Conti, as Albert Einstein — along with the military man who hires and subsequently oversees Oppenheimer, Leslie Graves (a predictably enjoyable Matt Damon), and Boris Pash (Casey Affleck), an Army counter-intelligence operative watching for security concerns tied to Oppenheimer.\n\nThere also are a couple of key women, psychiatrist Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), with whom he has recurring relations, and his wife, the frequently drinking biologist and botanist Kitty Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt). (Until fairly deep into the film, Nolan makes too little use of “A Quiet Place Part II” costars Blunt and Murphy together.) Both of them fuel concerns Oppenheimer has significant ties to Communism, as does his brother, Frank (Dylan Arnold).\n\nA film also needs its villain, this one’s proving to be Robert Downey Jr.’s Lewis Strauss, a founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. The final of the three acts of “Oppenheimer” dramatizes parallel proceedings in which Oppenheimer and Strauss essentially are put on trial. It’s compelling fare but not as compelling as what precedes it, despite fine work from Downey (“Chaplin”).\n\nBurning at surprisingly breakneck speed for a movie this long, dense and without at least conventional action sequences, “Oppenheimer” builds to a crescendo at the end of the second act with the re-creation of the famed Trinity test, the detonation of a bomb in the New Mexico desert close to the Manhattan Project’s top-secret Los Alamos base. According to the production information, Nolan told his effects team no digital imagery could be used, and the sequence’s visuals are highly impactful as a result.\n\nShot largely in New Mexico, “Oppenheimer” possesses a distinct look overall, captured by director of photography Hoyte Van Hoytema (“Dunkirk,” “Tenet”) on, as the aforementioned production info states, “a combination of IMAX 65mm and 65mm large-format film photography including, for the first time ever, sections in IMAX black and white analogue photography.”\n\nTruly, though, the reason to see the film in an IMAX auditorium may not be its larger-than-typical screen but instead its accompanying extra-thunderous sound system. “Oppenheimer” is consistently visceral from an audio perspective, thanks not only to the effects — the use of sound during the Trinity scene is next-level — but to the score by Ludwig Goransson (“Tenet,” “Black Panther”). Seemingly designed to never allow the viewer to relax, the affecting music is at times at odds with the dialogue, but not as often as in some previous Nolan efforts.\n\nThere is one more behind-the-scenes contributor whose work simply must be acknowledged: editor Jennifer Lame (“Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” “Tenet”). “Oppenheimer” moves so fluidly from scene to scene to scene that the stitching alone is astounding.\n\nWhile, yes, a biopic — we certainly understand Nolan’s treatise on J. Robert Oppenheimer by the conclusion — the auteur ultimately was interested in crafting a cautionary tale, one that reminds us the possibility of the rather rapid destruction of our world is an ever-present possibility. It may not succeed in achieving our biggest ask — giving us something new about which to ponder — but it is plenty powerful all the same.\n\n“Oppenheimer” is rated R for some sexuality, nudity and language. Runtime: 3 hours."

        "text": "Cillian Murphy‘s decades-long collaboration with Christopher Nolan hit a new peak with “Oppenheimer,” his first leading role in a Nolan feature that has garnered him the best reviews of his career and Oscar buzz for best actor. “Oppenheimer” follows Murphy’s supporting turns in three Batman films, “Inception” and “Interstellar.” Recently asked by The Independent if there were any Nolan movies not featuring Murphy that he wished he could’ve starred in, Murphy selected the director’s 2014 space epic “Interstellar.”\n\n“I adore ‘Interstellar’ just because I find it so emotional,” Murphy said. “I remember seeing it in the cinema when I had little kids. It just had a big impact on me. It broke my heart. I love watching his films when I’m not in them because you don’t have to freak out about the size of your ears, or whatever.”\n\nMurphy stressed that Nolan cast the “right people” in “Interstellar,” so there’s no hard feelings that he missed out on it. The epic stars Matthew McConaughey as an ex-NASA pilot who is recruited on a mission to locate a new planet outside of the solar system that can support human life. Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, Matt Damon and Michael Caine had supporting roles in the film.\n\nThe Independent also asked Murphy which Nolan movie he’d pair with “Oppenheimer” for a double feature.\n\n“You could go ‘Interstellar,’ which is very… explores similar scientific, physic themes. Or you could watch ‘Dunkirk,’ which is also set in World War II,” Murphy said. “‘Dunkirk’ is shorter, so that might be a good match ‘cause it’s like an hour-and-a-half, and then you can go into [‘Oppenheimer’].”\n\nDespite being a talky biographical drama that runs three hours and is rated R, “Oppenheimer” has already surpassed the lifetime domestic box office totals of “Interstellar” and “Dunkirk.” The film has earned $264 million in the U.S. and Canada, while its global gross is about to cross the $650 million mark. “Oppenheimer” is now playing in theaters nationwide."

        "text": "After starring in the critically acclaimed Oppenheimer and Peaky Blinders, many fans are wondering who are Cillian Murphy’s kids and why does he keep his private life hidden?\n\nCillian Murphy married Yvonne McGuinness in 2004 after they met in 1996 at one of his rock shows. They have two boys, Malachy and Aram, who they raise in Ireland. “We wanted them to be Irish, I suppose,” Murphy pointed out to The Guardian. It’s amazing how quickly their accents have adapted. Even within a year of moving back, they are fading into this rakish west Brit kind of thing. Which I think, hopefully, will get them lots of girls when they’re 15.”\n\nMurphy elaborated on the move to Deadline and why he’s not close to the movie industry based in Los Angeles. “We did live in London for 14 years, it was a big chunk of my life from my mid 20s to my late 30s. I really enjoyed it, it was really exciting, it’s a great city, but the move to Dublin wasn’t motivated by wanting to distance myself from the industry. I was purely motivated by wanting to come home to Ireland and raise our kids as Irish and be near our families.”\n\nHe continued, “I think the world we live in now, you’re proof of it as well, you can do your work remotely and the work will come to you. I don’t believe that you have to live in Los Angeles or New York or London to make good work; it means you have to travel a little more, but it hasn’t affected my work or professional life in any way. It just means that when I stop working, I’m not surrounded by it and that to me is healthy.”\n\nHe reflected about his time as a teenager and raising two teenage boys now. “I had bravado. But, deep down… I don’t know, they seem better adjusted than I was. More sure of themselves. I’m happy about that. For me, it was something that took a long time to figure out: that it’s all right to be you, that it’s all right to be an individual.”\n\nLiving in Ireland, the family does not have internet in their homes. “I’m a father of two teenagers, I once was young. I recognise how tricky it is for a young person today in society,” the Inception actor confided. “It is a very complex time growing up, things are changing a lot at a very accelerated rate. We’re all aware of the effect of the internet online and life online,” he told Mirror UK.\n\n“It feels to me like lots of kids, like their life exists inside of this device. The idea that empathy would form part of a curriculum is an excellent idea. Young people are caring and compassionate and willing to be.”\n\nIf there’s no Internet where they’re at what do they do? Well watch movies, of course! In an interview with Letterboxd during the Oppenheimer press tour, the Dark Knight actor said that he watched La Haine, Apocalypse Now, The Big Lebowski, and Midnight Cowboy. Though in an interview with The Standard in 2017, he said his work doesn’t fit in with his kids. “Most of what I do is highly unsuitable for them,” he told the outlet. “They’re suitably underwhelmed by my work. I’m trying to keep them in that state because it’s such a silly industry.”\n\nSo who are Cillian Murphy’s kids? Read more to find out.\n\nMalachy Murphy (born 2005)\n\nCillian Murphy and Yvonne McGuinness Raymond Hall/GC Images\n\nMalachy Murphy is Cillian Murphy and Yvonne McGuinness’ first child. He was born in 2005, one year after they got married. Not much is known about him, but McGuinness was pregnant with Malachy when Murphy was filming The Wind That Blows The Barley. He told The Guardian, “I was living at home with my folks; my wife was pregnant with our son; and we were running around the hills of west Cork shooting up Black and Tans. Fantastic!”\n\nWhen filming Peaky Blinders, Murphy talked about how his family kept him grounded when he returned home. “It’s cancelled life,” he explained to The Guardian. “You go home to your tiny apartment at the end of the day and you feed yourself for sustenance and you learn the lines for the next day and you try to get as much sleep as you possibly can. Which isn’t much. And then you get up and do it again. It takes time. My wife can see it happening. ‘OK. Tommy’s gradually leaving. I’m getting Cillian back.”\n\nAran Murphy (born 2007)\n\nAran Murphy is Cillian Murphy and Yvonne Guinness’s second child and son. Aran followed the footsteps of his father and became an actor. In 2019, Aran performed in a one-person play Hamnet based on the son of Shakespeare and the Brooklyn Academy of Music in Brooklyn, New York. The show garnered praised by the New York Times where they called Murphy a “blossomed” actor.\n\nMurphy praised his son’s abilities two years later with The Guardian. “He was so chilled about it, you know? He would come off stage and ask what the score was in the Liverpool game. And, again, you’re slightly jealous of that!” Murphy said. “There’s the danger that overanalyzing everything can erode the simplicity.”\n\nThe Peaky Blinders actor also put firm boundaries on his social and work life. “That work-life balance thing is hard. I have an amazing wife and I couldn’t do this without her and her understanding. But it is a struggle.“ He continued: “I think it is for any dad whose work takes him away, which it generally does, and which consumes him, which my work does.“\n\nOur mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

It follows two teenagers, Darren/Pig (Cillian Murphy) and Sinéad/Runt (Elaine Cassidy), whose incredibly close friendship quickly develops into something much deeper around their 17th birthday.\n\nWhile the tragic movie wasn't hugely loved by critics, audiences loved the intensity that Murphy brought to the role, and the movie has a 75% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nJust one year later, in 2002, Danny Boyle's \"28 Days Later\" arrived in theaters with its blistering new take on zombies and a modern apocalypse. It has equally high audience and critics' scores on Rotten Tomatoes, and for good reason.\n\nThe film hinges on Murphy's survivor, Jim, who wakes up in an abandoned hospital after the outbreak of a deadly virus that has led to rage-induced characteristics among the remaining population."

        "text": "Oppenheimer Day 3 earnings: Christopher Nolan-directed biographical drama Oppenheimer is going strength to strength at the Indian box office. The film is inching closer to the Rs 50 crore mark within the first three days of its release. Oppenheimer collected Rs 14.50 crore on its first Friday, Rs 17.25 crore on its first Saturday and around Rs 17.25 crore on its first Sunday, as per early estimates.\n\nWith this, the film is estimated to have raked in around Rs 49 crore in India during its first weekend, as per trade portal Sacnilk. The film had an overall occupancy of 56.66 per cent in English shows and 26.46 per cent in Hindi shows on Sunday.\n\nOppenheimer has had quite the run at the global box office as well. The biographical drama made nearly $80.5 million in North America and $93.7 million in other international markets, as per film trade analyst Sumit Kadel.

The film was shot entirely on Imax 65 mm and Panavision 65 mm film. This is unusual as Imax cameras are usually used for big action shots whereas more convenient cameras are used for other shots. Only 19 theatres in the US and 30 globally are showing the film in this format at present.\n\nImax refers to a standard for high-resolution cameras, film formats, projectors and cinemas. Imax movie screens are known for tall aspect ratios usually 1.43:1 or 1.90:1. These screens also have a steep stadium seating in the theatre, leading to better audio experience.\n\nOppenheimer focuses on the life of J Robert Oppenheimer, also known as the ‘father of the atomic bomb’. Oppenheimer was pivotal in developing the first nuclear weapons as part of the Manhattan Project. Manhattan Project was a research and development undertaking led by the US with support from the UK and Canada during World War II aimed at producing the first nuclear weapons.\n\nBacked by Universal Pictures, the film stars Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek, Kenneth Branagh and Gary Oldman in significant roles.

After several successful years playing Tommy Shelby in Peaky Blinders and a number of acclaimed feature films, Murphy has launched a significant appeal for an Academy Award, playing the lead role in Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer.\n\nHowever, Murphy is keen to deflect the many plaudits coming his way onto some of his contemporary actors, including another Nolan collaborator, Tom Hardy, who famously played the villain Bane in The Dark Knight Rises.\n\nIn a new interview with GQ, Murphy said, “He’s one of the best actors in the business. And we’ve developed this great trust and shorthand, and there’s a nice kind of chemistry, I think, between the two of us.”\n\nAs to whether Murphy has any plans to work with Hardy again, he added, “I’d love to work with him again. Maybe there’ll be a Peaky Blinders film. Maybe we’ll get to do it there. I’m not sure.”\n\nHowever, Murphy was coy on whether a Peaky Blinders film was actually moving into realisation. “I have no update for you, man,” he said. “I’m waiting to hear, but it’s a tricky time with all these strikes and everything going on. I’ve always said that if there’s more story to tell, I’d be there.”\n\nTom Hardy played the character Alfie Solomons in Peaky Blinders alongside Murphy, joining the Birmingham-based crime series in the second season.\n\nCheck out a clip of Hardy performing in the series below."

        "text": "We won’t pretend to speak for Cillian Murphy (though that is currently one of the few options at our disposal), but the Irish actor may well see some upsides to the sudden moratorium on promotional duties.\n\nChristopher Nolan was in Leicester Square nine days ago to introduce the premiere of his much-anticipated Oppenheimer. Murphy, who plays J Robert Oppenheimer, the “father of the atomic bomb”, in the sprawling epic, was conspicuous by his sudden absence. Co-stars Robert Downey jnr, Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt were equally elsewhere.\n\n“You’ve seen them here earlier on the red carpet,” Nolan explained. “Unfortunately, they are off to write their picket signs for what we believe to be an imminent strike by SAG, joining one of my guilds, the Writers Guild, in the struggle for fair wages for working members of their union.”\n\nNo doubt Murphy would have been happy to help out. But, over the last 25 years, he has been uneasy about the promotional business. He was in the acting game for over a decade before appearing on his first chatshow. He is not the only actor to recoil from opening up to strangers on red carpets, but he remains more forceful in his reluctance than most.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n“My job is to portray other people,” he told me in 2021. “The less that people know about me the better I can portray other people. That seems glaringly obvious and logical to me.”\n\nThe cone of silence lowers as Murphy reaches a new high in a notable career. Following early stage success with Corcadorca in his native Cork, he secured his first significant film role in Danny Boyle’s bone-rattling horror 28 Days Later from 2002. He became a regular in the Nolan stock company with performances in that director’s Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and Inception.\n\nHe was placed at the centre of the hugely popular TV show Peaky Blinders. But none of this brings the same level of attention as playing the title role in a $100 million biopic. To this point, Murphy has come across as a character actor – extremely good-looking, but not in a way Hollywood expects – who has found himself taking lead roles. He is a dab hand at oddballs. And there are few balls odder than Oppenheimer.\n\n[ Oppenheimer review: Cillian Murphy gives a commanding turn. But why is Florence Pugh reduced to Crazy Naked Chick? ]\n\n[ Oppenheimer reviews: what do the critics say about Christopher Nolan’s drama? ]\n\nTaking inspiration from Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin’s book American Prometheus, the film gives Murphy free rein to explore the physicist’s eccentricities. He famously left a poisoned apple (uneaten, thank goodness) for his tutor when at Cambridge. We are left with a genius believably tortured by the decisions other people made following, in the summer of 1945, the first successful detonation of an A-bomb. There is weirdness and vulnerability in there. Those are characteristics Murphy has traded in since he shifted towards acting at the end of the last century.\n\nIf you know anything about Cillian Murphy’s early life you probably know that rock music’s loss was the theatre’s gain. Raised in Ballintemple, he is the child of educators. Mum was a French teacher. Dad worked for the Department of Education. He “did well in the Leaving” and made his way, with measured enthusiasm, to study law at UCC.\n\nCillian Murphy (right) in the 2001 film version of Disco Pigs\n\nMeanwhile, he and his pals had been creating complex, wacky tunes with their band The Sons of Mr Green Genes (named for, of all unfashionable things, a song from Frank Zappa’s Hot Rats). There is another part of the metaverse in which Murphy has, now a rock veteran, just completed a third successive Saturday-night slot on the Second Stage at Glastonbury. He has the cheekbones for a rock star. Those famous, piercing blue eyes could generate a cult on their own.\n\nThe band allegedly secured a decent offer from a British label. Back in 2012, I asked him if he ever mourned the road not taken.\n\n“There was a time when I felt that,” he said. “But now I am more confident. I always knew there was a ceiling that I had as a musician, and I feel that was reached pretty quickly. But with acting I feel like I have more to prove. Also, the music industry has changed. It’s so hard to make money.”\n\nMurphy will, no doubt, regret that, less than a year before the release of Oppenheimer, Corcadorca, the great independent theatre company that gave him his break, closed its doors for good. The legend goes he saw the company performing an adaptation of A Clockwork Orange and knew instantly that is where he wanted to be. His first lead role came opposite Eileen Walsh in Enda Walsh’s Disco Pigs. Following a pair of off-beam teenagers as they ramble through “Pork City”, the 1996 production was a sensation and eventually became a film directed by Kirsten Sheridan.\n\n“Everybody knows Disco Pigs changed everything for me,” he told Peter Crawley for this newspaper on the play’s 20th anniversary. “It was the first thing I ever did, and it formed me totally. It’s hard not to be nostalgic about these things. But it really was a brilliant time for me. It was the confidence of youth – or the ignorance of youth. Maybe a combination of both. Trying to get to that level again was a struggle.”\n\nThere has been amusing discussion about Murphy’s physical suitability for the role of Oppenheimer. Surely he is too young to play the gaunt, furrowed scientist at the point of his great triumph. In fact, the actor, at 47, is a full seven years older than Oppenheimer at the time of the Trinity test. The slim, sapphire-eyed youth who emerged from Disco Pigs and went on to flee zombies in 28 Days Later seems oddly unchanged by the passing decades. Mind you, Tom Cruise, 15 years his senior, can boast the same.\n\nIn 2002, when 28 Days Later opened, the nation was still mildly surprised to find an Irish actor at the heart of a major motion picture. Colin Farrell, born in the same year as Murphy, was up there in Minority Report, but who could have guessed, after early inconveniences, the Dubliner would play the game so skilfully and prosper into his forties. Saoirse Ronan was five years away from her Oscar nomination for Atonement. Michael Fassbender was taking small roles in Band of Brothers and NCS: Manhunt. Paul Mescal was seven years old. The current Irish bossing of Hollywood was a long way off.\n\nCIllian Murphy as J Robert Oppenheimer\n\nWhether consciously or not, Murphy found himself keeping the career on a steady simmer over the succeeding 20 years. He had stage success. Reviewing his 2002 turn in Neil LaBute’s The Shape of Things at the Gate for this paper, Fintan O’Toole remarked: “Murphy measures out his metamorphosis with an impressive subtlety and intelligence.” Nolan caught the appeal early on and cast him as The Scarecrow in Batman Begins from 2005. He returned to the role for The Dark Knight. Neil Jordan allowed Murphy his biggest challenge yet when he cast him as a transgender Northerner in an adaptation of Pat McCabe’s Breakfast on Pluto in 2005 (a decision that might cause some furrowing of brows today). The role was typical of an actor steering away from the tempting perils of mainstream blockbusters to seek thornier challenges.\n\nThe apparent stability of his home life reinforced that sense of a safe ship being piloted steadily forward. The word “apparent” is there to press home his continuing resistance to prying or probing. You couldn’t quite call him an enigma. He does not – so far as we are aware – spend his summers among any sinister cults. He has no expensively vulgar movie-star hobbies. In 2004, he married Yvonne McGuinness, an artist whom he met in his budding rock star days, and began the raising of two sons in London before moving them all back to Dublin in 2015.\n\n“Well, I suppose to be closer to family,” he told me in 2021. “The kids are of a certain age. I think if you live in a world capital – like New York or London or wherever – it’s excellent and exciting and stimulating in your 20s and 30s. Then there’s a point where the things that were excellent and stimulating are now a bit sort of tedious and draining. You want something quieter and that’s what we did.”\n\nSuch is the nature of Oppenheimer – a huge biopic from a prestige director – there would be talk of an Oscar nomination if Murphy were merely adequate in the role. As it transpires, he owns the film\n\nYet for all the assertions of normality, there remains a mystery – if not quite that enigma – about what Cillian Murphy does on screen. There always seems to be something held strategically back. There is a tension within him that hints at impending explosion. That unease helped Ken Loach’s The Wind that Shakes the Barley, in which he played a rebel in the War of Independence, to the Palme d’Or at the 2006 Cannes film festival.\n\nThere is a campaigning side to his personality. Last year, Ionbhá: The Empathy Book for Ireland, a collection of essays and poems he edited to support the “Activating Social Empathy” education programme, was published by Mercier Press. “The book was something that we had been talking about for ages, just to try and get this idea of empathy into the common vernacular/vocabulary,” he said following the book’s release. He supported the 2007 Rock the Vote campaign. He is a patron of the Unesco Child and Family Research Centre at the University of Galway. Murphy may not enjoy putting himself before interrogators, but he does allow whispers of the inner man to emerge.\n\nAnd yet. Looking back through his interviews, again and again you get the sense of a man who wants the wider world to know him only through his work. More Paul Schofield than Oliver Reed. More Scott Walker than Sean Ryder.\n\n“There’s no baggage,” he told me over a decade ago. “They haven’t seen you being funny on a talkshow. They just get the character. I could never be funny on a talkshow. ... I am not that sort of person. I know what I am good at, and being funny on a talkshow is not what I am at.”\n\nNobody knows how long the strike will last. Fran Drescher, the admirable president of actors’ union SAG-AFTRA, sounded determined in her rousing speeches last week. Brian Cox is among those who feels the dispute, largely concerning residuals on streaming services and the threat of artificial intelligence, could drag on until the end of the year. There is, thus, a decent chance that Murphy could avoid that one turn in luckier actors’ lives when there is near-irresistible pressure to be “funny on a talkshow”.\n\nSuch is the nature of Oppenheimer – a huge biopic from a prestige director – there would be talk of an Oscar nomination if Murphy were merely adequate in the role. As it transpires, he owns the film, finding a scratchy intensity that communicates the momentousness of the subject’s commission. He gets to deliver Oppenheimer’s famous line twice and twice masters every vowel and consonant. “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,” the scientist said, quoting the Bhagavad-gita. Murphy gets to coil up tensely when the authorities come for him during the McCarthyite witch-hunts. He has moments of qualified elation.\n\nIt would be astonishing if his name were not there when the nominations are announced on January 24th. Most contenders have yet to screen. Maybe Joaquin Phoenix could be there for Ridley Scott’s Napoleon. Adam Driver might make some noise in Michael Mann’s Ferrari. Away from biopics, Paul Giamatti looks possible in Alexander Payne’s The Holdovers. But Murphy is currently the one holding all the cards.\n\nIn any normal year, the horrors of “awards season” would loom. Remember how, last time, the gallant Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell, ultimately both nominated for The Banshees of Inisherin, launched a double-act at the Venice Film Festival in September that played every talkshow for the succeeding six months.\n\nMurphy will be expected to do silly video things, more serious print profiles and cheery stints on food shows. He will be expected to accept largely made-up Turny Awards – given to celebs who turn-up – at events in desert retreats and mountaintop ski resorts. Even the most gregarious find their will to live sapped. Obviously, as a sound Cork man, he will want the strike settled quickly and wish his colleagues back to work. But he could be forgiven for savouring a few months’ peace.\n\n“There’s no trick to it,” he once told me, pondering the privacy he maintains. “It’s not a problem if you live a reasonably normal life and don’t go to events that are not obligatory.”\n\nGood luck with that.\n\nOppenheimer is in cinemas\n\nTen milestones in Cillian Murphy’s career\n\nIt has largely been plain and steady sailing for Murphy. So there are few massive jumps up the ladder. Just a confident drift through the business called show.\n\nDisco Pigs (1996)\n\nIt all began with this performance opposite Eileen Walsh in Corcadorca’s ground-breaking play about two kids adrift in a nightmarish version of contemporary Cork. “You are always kind of reaching towards having that experience again,” Murphy said. Also a 2001 film.\n\nOn The Edge (2001)\n\nRarely mentioned when people talk of Murphy or of director John Carney, this decent drama concerns a suicidal young man’s experiences in a Dublin psychiatric hospital. Carney and Murphy also worked together on the first (apparently lost) version of the director’s sci-fi comedy Zonad.\n\n28 Days Later (2002)\n\nHere’s where the international film career really kicks off. Murphy plays a young man who wakes from a coma to discover the world infected by a virus that sends humankind deranged. This writer’s contender for Danny Boyle’s best film.\n\nBatman Begins (2005)\n\nMurphy has largely stayed away from franchise hell, but he makes an exception for his regular collaborator Christopher Nolan. The relationship began with his turn as the deranged Scarecrow in the director’s first visit to Gotham. “I wanted to avoid the Worzel Gummidge look,” Murphy wisely remarked.\n\nBreakfast On Pluto (2005)\n\nSlightly tricky casting now. Murphy demonstrates his range by playing a witty transgender foundling in Neil Jordan’s characteristically colourful take on a characteristically antic novel by Pat McCabe.\n\nThe Wind that Shakes the Barley, directed by Ken Loach and starring Cillian Murphy (left).\n\nThe Wind That Shakes The Barley (2006)\n\nThe first Irish film to win the Palme d’Or at Cannes. The first of Ken Loach’s two triumphs at the event. Murphy is strong as an IRA volunteer in a movie that is as much about later betrayals of the revolution as it is about British tyranny.\n\nHippie Hippie Shake (2010?)\n\nA mischievous inclusion. Beeban Kidron’s examination of the Oz obscenity trial in early 1970s London – featuring Murphy as Oz editor Richard Neville – deserves note here as one of the most mysteriously unreleased films ever completed. The reasons for its non-emergence remain undisclosed.\n\nPeaky Blinders (2013-2022)\n\nFor a large portion of the world, Cillian Murphy remains “the bloke out of Peaky Blinders”. Set in Birmingham during the early part of the last century, the sprawling crime drama developed into a popular epic and made Murphy’s Tommy Selby an equivocal anti-hero.\n\nA Quiet Place Part II (2021)\n\nMurphy was one of the stars entrusted with responsibility for opening cinemas again after the pandemic when he appeared as a reclusive survivor in this fine sequel to the 2018 horror. “People kept sending me degraded pictures of myself on the side of empty buses,” he said, noting how publicity for the film’s first release date hung around after the virus hit.\n\nOppenheimer (2023)\n\nWho knew that a Christopher Nolan film about the birth of the atomic bomb would get so tied up with a study of Barbie? Murphy is surely in the race for an academy award as his portrayal of the eccentric J Robert Oppenheimer arrives simultaneously with Greta Gerwig’s dolly flick. It’s Barbenheimer time."

        "text": "We’re glad to be living in a time when trailblazers like Cillian Murphy dominate the entertainment scene! Whether it’s his riveting act in Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer or his stoic and daring persona in Peaky Blinders – Murphy’s big Hollywood outings are par excellence. Truly dedicated towards his craft, Murphy is hailed for going all in for his projects, deeply immersing himself into the character he’s playing. This all-encompassing approach not only involves intense mental preparation but undergoing a drastic physical change and Murphy has an exceptional ability to morph his physique. Having to constantly meet his characters’ needs, Cillian Murphy has to change up his workout routine and diet plans every now and then. Fitness is never easy, folks!\n\nIf you’ve been following the actor, you know that he usually opts to stay lean and slim. However, he took things a notch higher and started bulking up to transform into Peaky Blinders’ Thomas Shelby. From indulging in strength training to upping his protein intake, the actor spruced things up to prepare for the role. On the other hand, his quest to look like physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer took him on a polar opposite journey, where he didn’t think much about food and was borderline emaciated. Dwindling between extreme physicalities is no easy feat, but Murphy still aced it all.\n\nIf you’re curious to know Cillian Murphy’s workout routine as he prepped for both of the iconic characters, keep reading.\n\nCillian Murphy’s workout plan to maintain a toned physique\n\nIn a conversation with The Radio Times in 2022, Murphy spoke about his workout routine for Peaky Blinders. “I’m not a very physically imposing person. So, I have to eat a lot of protein and lift a lot of weights and do all that stuff. So that takes a while, which I hate,” he mentioned.\n\nWhat workouts did he exactly undertake? According to Jacked Gorilla, Murphy did a semi-basic routine that included core exercises, callisthenics as well as weight training. The actor worked out five days a week and had two days of complete rest. To fancify his training, the actor would also go for hikes. Let’s break down his workout routine for you.\n\nMonday: Chest and Triceps\n\nChest and triceps are two of the most important muscle groups in your upper body, which when worked together, are very effective for building muscle mass. Doing compound movements that hit both these muscle groups together can optimise your results and make your workout sessions more time efficient. Working the chest and triceps together helps build functional upper body strength and improves posture as well as cardiovascular health. The intense workout also has mood-boosting effects that lead to reduced stress levels.\n\nHere’s what Cillian Murphy’s Monday workout looked like:\n\nBench Press (3 sets, 12 reps)\n\nPush Ups (4 sets, 25 reps)\n\nLying Tricep Extension with Dumbbells (3 sets, 10 reps)\n\nDips (4 sets, 10 reps)\n\nIncline Dumbbell Press (3 sets 12 reps)\n\nCore:\n\nSit Ups (3 sets, 20 reps)\n\nLying Leg Raises (3 sets, 20 reps)\n\nTuesday: Legs and calves\n\nMany of us HATE leg day and maybe Cillian Murphy does too! But sadly, there’s no escaping this very important workout if you want to build those gorgeous calves. While you might dread the soreness in your legs post-exercise, let’s familiarise you with some solid benefits of working this muscle that might imbue you with some motivation.\n\nStaying consistent with your leg workouts will enhance the body’s strength, speed, and stability. Strong leg muscles give your body the much-needed balance which isn’t possible with upper body workouts.\n\nSince your legs have bigger muscles, you can place more load on them. More load translates to more strength and more calories being used up. This leads to improved metabolism, which fosters the fat-burning process. Furthermore, leg exercises like squats and deadlifts strengthen your hips, make your body more athletic and less prone to injuries.\n\nFunctional exercises like lunges and squats are also great for your joints, promoting knee stability. According to the American Council on Exercise (via Medicine Net) leg workouts are the best way to prevent ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) tear (a common type of knee ligament tear). It’s time to let the calf raises begin!\n\nCheck out Cillian Murphy’s Tuesday workout:\n\nLeg Press (3 sets, 12 reps)\n\nCalf Raises on Leg Press (4 sets, 25 reps)\n\nGlute Ham Raise (3 sets, 10 reps)\n\nWeighted Lunges (4 sets, 10 reps)\n\nSquat Variation (3 sets, 12 reps)\n\nCore:\n\nCable Crunches (3 sets, 20 reps)\n\nHanging Leg Raises (3 sets, 20 reps)\n\nWednesday: Rest\n\nOn Wednesday, the actor took his well-deserved rest and so can you!\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Cillian Murphy (@cillianmurphyoffical)\n\nThursday: Shoulders and traps\n\nMany people train the traps and shoulders together as the upper portion of the traps is heavily involved in most shoulder exercises. Therefore, training the traps after the shoulders makes your workout efficient, as the former muscle is already warmed up and ready to go. For those unversed, trap workouts target the trapezius muscle – the broad, flat back muscle that looks like a trapezoid.\n\nBuilding both these muscles not only gives you those dreamy broad shoulders but makes all your upper body movements easier. Strong shoulders and trapezius muscles offer support in weight-bearing activities, reduce the pains and stiffness in arms as well as help recuperate from any upper body injury faster. Especially for people who’re always in front of a screen and leading a sedentary lifestyle, shoulder and trap exercises will help avoid chronic pain in the back, neck, or shoulders.\n\nThis is the blueprint of Cillian Murphy’s Thursday workout:\n\nSeated Military Press (3 sets, 12 reps)\n\nCable Front Raises (4 sets, 25 reps)\n\nHang Cleans (3 sets, 10 reps)\n\nBarbell Shrugs (4 sets, 10 reps)\n\nBent Over Shoulder DB Flys (3 sets, 12 reps)\n\nCore:\n\nSit Ups with Twist (3 sets, 20 reps)\n\nHanging Knee Raises with Twist (3 sets, 20 reps)\n\nFriday: Back and biceps\n\nBack and bicep workouts are often paired together because training the back involves a lot of bicep movement, which warms up this muscle without additional work. Working both the pulling muscles simultaneously allows for maximum recovery between sessions, giving you maximised results with minimum motion.\n\nWhen you combine the two, you actually get your biceps to work more because of their involvement in back exercises. Since biceps are considered a hard muscle group to build because they’re very small, this workout is the best way to foster their growth. Moreover, as there aren’t many variations in bicep exercises, combining it with back diversifies your session, making it more interesting.\n\nLet’s look at Cillian Murphy’s Friday workout checklist:\n\nHex Bar Deadlift (3 sets, 12 reps)\n\nWide Push Ups (4 sets, 25 reps)\n\nCable Rows (3 sets, 10 reps)\n\nChin Ups (4 sets, 10 reps)\n\nWide Lat Pulldowns (3 sets, 12 reps)\n\nCore:\n\nBicycle Crunches (3 sets, 20 reps)\n\nRussian Twists (3 sets, 20 reps)\n\nSaturday: Hiking\n\nGetting an adrenaline boost in the great outdoors is the perfect way to improve your mental as well as physical health. Hiking is a great whole-body workout that targets everything from your head to toe. From lowering the risk of heart disease, reducing anxiety and depression to building bone density and improving balance – hiking is one of the best ways to exercise, no matter what type of trail you’re on! So, it’s time to tighten your hiking boots, grab a water bottle, sunscreen, and venture outdoors!\n\nSunday: Rest\n\nCongratulations, you’ve successfully completed Cillian Murphy’s workout routine. It’s time for some rest.\n\nCillian Murphy was on a calorie-deficit diet for ‘Oppenheimer’\n\nFor Oppenheimer, Cillian Murphy built an extremely slim frame to look like the eponymous creator of the atomic bomb. He was on an extreme calorie- deficit diet and lost weight so drastically that even his co-stars were in shock. In a conversation with Extra, Oppenheimer actor Emily Blunt revealed that Murphy “could only eat, like, an almond every day,” adding that he was very emaciated.\n\nCillian, who’s known for going to extremes to get into the skin of the character, also spoke about how he physically morphed into the character. Talking to The New York Times, he said,” I love acting with my body, and Oppenheimer had a very distinct physicality and silhouette, which I wanted to get right.”\n\nOwing to the scientist’s thin physicality, the actor said he had to lose quite a bit of weight. Did you know that Oppenheimer passed away in 1967 owing to his unhealthy lifestyle?\n\nWhile Cillian might’ve dared to tread on the scientist’s dietary habits, you better not!\n\nHero image: Courtesy peakyblindersofficial/ Instagram; Feature image: Courtesy oppenheimermovie/ Instagram)"

That was a big influence on us. I think being in Cork in Ireland, we were probably a bit late to the party with that sound.”\n\nWhile his music career fizzled out, Cillian soon discovered a love – and talent – for acting, making his stage debut in Edna Walsh’s Disco Pigs play in 1996.\n\nHis latest movie, Christopher Nolan’s biopic Oppenheimer, arrived in cinemas last month and has already broken records.\n\nREAD MORE:"

This premiere will be followed by a Q&A session with the creative team.\n\nThe festival promises four days of music, dance, literature, theatre, and conversations. With a mix of ticketed and free events, it is curated by Festival Director Mary Hickson, Bryce and Aaron Dessner from The National, Cillian Murphy, and playwright Enda Walsh.\n\nA collaboration between the Abbey Theatre and Sounds from a Safe Harbour is set to present 'Untitled Song Cycle,' by Enda Walsh and Anna Mullarkey.

        "text": "Matt Damon and Emily Blunt said they got lost in Cillian Murphy's eyes while filming \"Oppenheimer.\" John Phillips/Getty Images\n\nThe cast of \"Oppenheimer\" said they were regularly distracted by Cillian Murphy's eyes while on set.\n\n\"It's a real problem when you're doing scene work with Cillian,\" Matt Damon told People Magazine.\n\nChristopher Nolan previously said he cast Murphy for the titular role because of his intense stare.\n\nEver find yourself getting lost in Cillian Murphy's piercing blue eyes? You're not the only one — it sounds like even the actor's costars in \"Oppenheimer\" weren't immune to his striking gaze.\n\nAnd Matt Damon told People Magazine in a group interview alongside Murphy and Emily Blunt that it could be distracting while on set.\n\n\"It's a real problem when you're doing scene work with Cillian,\" Damon said. \"Sometimes you find yourself just swimming in his eyes.\"\n\n\"It's like that 'Ocean Eyes' song by Billie Eilish. We just hum it all day,\" Blunt added.\n\nMurphy plays the titular character in \"Oppenheimer,\" a historical drama about J. Robert Oppenheimer, an American theoretical physicist known as the father of the atomic bomb.\n\nDamon stars as Gen. Leslie Groves, the military officer who oversaw the Manhattan Project, and Blunt plays the role of Oppenheimer's wife, Katherine \"Kitty\" Oppenheimer.\n\nThe film is directed by Christopher Nolan, who previously told The Hollywood Reporter that it was an obvious decision to cast Murphy in the lead role.\n\nMurphy and Robert J. Oppenheimer. Universal Pictures, PhotoQuest/Getty Images\n\n\"I've been staring at the cover of the book 'American Prometheus' for so many months, and there's this photograph, black and white, a light blue-eyed stare, very intense, of this guy,\" Nolan told The Hollywood Reporter. \"And I thought, 'Well, I know who could do that.'\"\n\n\"Oppenheimer\" is Murphy's sixth film with Nolan, but it's the first in which he takes the lead role.\n\nThe director told Entertainment Weekly in May that he was initially drawn to Murphy because of his \"crazy eyes.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I remember I was up in San Francisco writing 'Batman Begins,' and there was something in the San Francisco Chronicle about '28 Days Later.' I saw a picture of you with your shaved head and your crazy eyes — no offense,\" Nolan said.\n\n\"I remember being struck by your presence, literally from that one photograph, and then started to look into who you were and what you'd done, and got very excited about the idea of meeting you and having you screen test for Batman,\" the filmmaker told Murphy.\n\nThe Irish actor got the role of the villain Scarecrow in Nolan's \"The Dark Knight Trilogy,\" forming an 18-plus-year partnership. Murphy went on to play a wealthy businessman's heir in \"Inception\" and appeared as a soldier in \"Dunkirk.\"\n\nRead the original article on Insider"

        "text": "Cillian Murphy's biggest Best Actor Oscar competition\n\nThere could be not one but TWO fellow Irish actors competing against Cillian Murphy on Oscars night.\n\nWith Oppenheimer in cinemas now, and proving to be a massive box office success already, millions of movie fans around the world are witnessing the incredible performance by Cillian Murphy in the titular role.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the movie's release, Murphy was launched directly into the conversation around the Best Actor Oscar, with many believing he is pretty much a sure thing for a nomination, if not taking the gold trophy home on the night next March.\n\nWhile we're still a good way off from the big night - and with half of Hollywood currently on strike, there is no saying if the movies or the awards night will go ahead as planned - but from what we see at the moment, these are Murphy's biggest competition for that Academy Award.\n\nKingsley Ben-Adir - Bob Marley: One Love\n\nBen-Adir has already had a bonkers busy 2023, having appeared in Barbie and Marvel's Secret Invasion, but his role in this biopic of the famed musician is sure to send him into another level of fame. The Oscars love to give biopics some love - just look at Bohemian Rhapsody - so if Ben-Adir pulls this off, it could represent a major threat to Cillian's chances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGael Garcia Bernal - Cassandro\n\nBest known for his roles in Y Tu Mama Tambien, Werewolf By Night and Mozart in the Jungle, Bernal is already getting some incredible reviews for his performance in this biopic of gay wrestler Saúl Armendáriz in the 1980s. At the time of writing, the movie has a perfect 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes, with every single review aiming the majority of its praise towards Bernal's fearless turn.\n\nBradley Cooper - Maestro\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCooper already has nine - NINE! - Oscar nominations for his acting, writing, producing and directing, but while A Star Is Born landed those around him with awards, he unfortunately missed out. In Maestro, Cooper is once again writing and directing, plus he's starring as famed conductor and composer Leonard Bernstein, with the movie focusing on his relationship with his wife Felicia Montealegre, played by fellow Oscar nominations magnet Carey Mulligan.\n\nColman Domingo - Rustin\n\nNot quite as famous as some of the other potential nominees on this list, Domingo has been quietly stealing scenes in supporting roles in movies and shows like Lincoln, Euphoria and Selma for years. In his movie Rustin, which is being produced by the Obamas, Domingo is playing Bayard Rustin, the gay civil rights activist who helped Martin Luther King Jr. and others organise the 1963 March on Washington.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio - Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sixth time that DiCaprio and Scorsese have worked together, but to date, the only time DiCaprio has won an acting Oscar, it wasn't for any of his team-ups with Scorsese. Maybe this real life serial killer drama will change that. Early reviews are already claiming that this could be the best performance of DiCaprio's career to date, so if we were to guess, this will be Cillian Murphy's biggest competition on the big night.\n\nAlden Ehrenreich - Fair Play\n\nCillian Murphy's Oppenheimer co-star could end up sharing that nominations screen with him thanks to this intense erotic thriller. While this is normally the kind of genre that doesn't get too much attention, the early screenings have viewers pointing out Ehrenreich's pitch perfect performance in a movie that is filled with sex, money and corporate backstabbing. Sounds fun!\n\nMichael Fassbender - The Killer\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid Fincher's last five films - Mank, Gone Girl, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, The Social Network, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button - all landed their lead performers with an Oscar nomination. No reason to think that this dark psychological thriller set in the world of professional assassinations won't do the same for Fassbender.\n\nPaul Giamatti - The Holdovers\n\nThis is one of those actors that you would assume has a trophy case full of Oscars already, but nope. To date, Giamatti has only been nominated once, and it wasn't even for a good movie: Cinderella Man. By re-teaming with his Sideways director on this emotional comedy drama, Giamatti looks like he'll be delivering a performance that is practically guaranteed awards attention.\n\nBarry Keoghan - Saltburn\n\nYep, just one year after his Best Supporting Actor turn, our Barry could jump into the Best Actor race in this dark comedy thriller from the writer/director of the brilliant Promising Young Woman. In the new movie, Murphy plays a college student who becomes a bit obsessed with his classmate (Euphoria's Jacob Elordi), who happens to be from a very rich and aristocratic family.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix - Napoleon\n\nOne Oscar win already (for Joker), and three more nominations to date, it is clear that the Academy loves Phoenix. Here he is re-teaming with his Gladiator director for this epic historical drama, telling the rise to power of Napoleon Bonaparte, told through the lens of his relationship with Empress Joséphine (Mission Impossible's Vanessa Kirby).\n\n﻿\n\nRelated articles:"

        "text": "Chris Hemsworth is undoubtedly one of this generation’s finest action stars, and his portrayals in movies such as ‘Thor’ and ‘Extraction’ are a testament to his success. However, one movie that made him go to extreme lengths is none other than Ron Howard’s ‘In The Heart Of The Sea,’ which saw him playing the role of Owen Chase.\n\nBefore that movie, Hemsworth never had a drastic physical transformation. But Howard’s film was about a group of people stranded in the middle of the sea and fighting for survival. So, it doesn’t come as a shock that the actor had to shed the pounds and restrict his diet. However, the diet was so meager that he and his co-stars, Cillian Murphy and Ben Whishaw, could barely have one egg a day.\n\nWhile speaking in an interview with Men’s Health. Chris Hemsworth opened up about various aspects of the movie and didn’t shy away from sharing the methods he employed to shed the pounds. He said, “We couldn’t go away for a month and get skinny, we had to do it while we were shooting. At one point, a day’s rations were a boiled egg, a couple of crackers, and a celery stick.”\n\nChris Hemsworth also joked that 90% of their conversations on the set were about food. He added, “I reckon about 90% of our conversations were about our favourite foods and what we would eat when we finished the film.”\n\nThis drastic dietary restriction was necessary for Hemsworth to portray his character authentically, Owen Chase, who finds himself stranded at sea in the movie inspired by Moby Dick. Set in 1820, the movie follows the harrowing journey of Chase and his crew as they struggle against a sperm whale that captures their ship, leading to the deaths of many crew members. To accurately portray the physical toll of their ordeal, Hemsworth had to lose an astounding amount of weight. He previously revealed that he lost a staggering 15kg, equivalent to 33 lbs.\n\nIn a photograph shared on social media at the time, the Extraction actor showcased his usually muscular frame, looking notably bony, with long and shaggy facial hair. Alongside the surprising image, he humorously remarked, “Just tried a new diet/training program called ‘Lost At Sea.’ Wouldn’t recommend it.”\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Chris Hemsworth (@chrishemsworth)\n\nThe Thor actor’s dedication to his craft is evident in his transformation for this role. His commitment to embodying the physical aspect of his character is a testament to his versatility as an actor. Fans were taken aback by his slimmed-down appearance but made one thing clear he was willing to push the boundaries to deliver an authentic performance.\n\nFor more such news, stay tuned to Koimoi.\n\nMust Read: Margot Robbie Gets Trolled For Her Alleged Buccal Fat Removal, Lip Filler & Nose Job, Netizens Call It The “Prime Example Of What Success Can Do For Your Looks”\n\nFollow Us: Facebook | Instagram | Twitter | Youtube | Google News"

Murphy, who played American theoretical physicist J Robert Oppenheimer in the Christopher Nolan-directed movie, said Nolan's films don't have extra footage.\"There's no deleted scenes in Chris Nolan movies that's why there are no DVD extras,\" Murphy told Collider.He said \"Oppenheimer\" is no exception.\"The script is the movie. He knows exactly what's going to end up. He's not fiddling around with it trying to change the story. That is the movie,\" the actor said.In 2012, Nolan had also spoken about the lack of extra footage in his movies.\"I tend to try and weed things out on paper because it's crazy expensive to shoot things that aren't going to be in the film. It also takes up a lot of time and energy. Pretty much with all my films, there are very few deleted scenes, which always disappoints the DVD crowd,\" he had told MTV.\"Oppenheimer\" has made USD 552.9 million worldwide since its release three weeks ago, according to US media reports."

        "text": "Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie starrer, 'Barbie' finally hit the theatres worldwide on July 21. It clashed with Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer'. Both movies created a lot of buzz ahead of the release. The Day 1 collection of 'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' are out. The Greta Gerwig's comedy-drama has received a positive response from both critics and audience but it minted less than Cillian Murphy starrer in India.\n\nAs per a report in Sacnilk, 'Barbie' opened with only Rs 5 crore on its first day of release while Christopher Nolan's biographical thriller 'Oppenheimer' reportedly pocketed Rs 13.50 crore in India. The same portal reported that Margot Robbie starrer had 41.61 percent English occupancy on Friday. While 'Oppenheimer' was leading the race in India. However, 'Barbie' is said to be performing better in the US. As per Variety, it has already earned a whopping $22.3 million in the US, whereas 'Oppenheimer' has minted $10.5 million.\n\nReports also state that 16,000 tickets of 'Barbie' had been sold in its advance booking across three multiple chains - PVR, INOX and Cinepolis, for Day 1 whereas 'Oppenheimer' had sold close to 1.30 lakh tickets for Day 1 across the same cinema hall chains.\n\nMeanwhile, the Christopher Nolan directorial has also reportedly surpassed Tom Cruise’s 'Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One', which had earned Rs 12.50 crores in India on the first day of its release.\n\nTalking about 'Barbie', the movie is inspired by the most-beloved Barbie fashion dolls. It also stars Ariana Greenblatt, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Emma Mackey, and others. 'Oppenheimer' is based on the Pulitzer Prize–winning biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer. It also stars Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Florence Pugh among others."

It’s a striking claim from someone who has directed some of the most gargantuan blockbusters of the past 15 years – but it’s not inaccurate. At the heart of the biographical drama, which stars Cillian Murphy as the man who masterminded the birth of the atomic bomb, lies a truth of planetary scale. When the weapon was first tested – an event now known by its codename, Trinity – there was a chance that it might wipe out all of human existence. A prospect such as that would probably deter most people from proceeding, but not Oppenheimer; he pushed the button anyway.\n\n“The film I wanted to make couldn’t have been done smaller,” Nolan says of the $100m (£77.7m) film one day after its world premiere in Paris. “It’s not about money, it’s not about budget – the magnitude of the story is what attracted me to it. The fact that Oppenheimer and his fellow scientists couldn’t completely eliminate the possibility that they might set fire to the atmosphere and destroy the entire world, but still triggered the test – the idea of someone taking that risk on behalf of all of us and all our descendants. There’s nothing bigger than that.”\n\nThe film hinged, though, on finding the right individual to bring Oppenheimer to life. Murphy, 47, had worked with the filmmaker five times before – on the Dark Knight trilogy (2005-12), Inception (2010), and Dunkirk (2017) – but in supporting roles; always Nolan’s bridesmaid, never the bride. This time round, he was wanted for the top job and, one chilly day in October 2021, the Irish actor received a call from Nolan informing him so. It was an instant yes.\n\n“In typical Chris fashion, he didn’t tell me he was writing a script,” a visibly tired Murphy tells me on the final day of the film’s press tour; in just 24 hours, he will leave the UK premiere alongside his co-stars in solidarity with the actors’ strike in Hollywood. “There was no build-up or warning; he just called me out of the blue and said, ‘Would you like to play him?’ I’d be lying if I said I didn’t desperately want to play a lead for him. I think any actor in the world would want to work with Chris, whatever size the part. It was a dream.”\n\nCillian Murphy chooses the Christopher Nolan film he would double bill with Oppenheimer\n\nNolan has long been one of the world’s premier directors. After breaking onto the indie film scene with Following (1998) and Memento (2000), the London-born Nolan delivered the one-two punch of Batman Begins (2005) and The Prestige (2006), showing that he could steer projects of any size to both critical and commercial success. By the time The Dark Knight became the highest-grossing film of 2008, he had been handed the keys to Hollywood.\n\nOppenheimer is Nolan’s 12th release – and it could be his least commercial one yet: a chewy, three-hour-long pressure-cooker of a film that’s partly shot in black and white, and told in, you guessed it, non-linear form. It’s well known that the writer-director opts to shun CGI in favour of practical effects: he had a rotating corridor created for mind-bending thriller Inception, brought in real battleships while filming the intense Second World War drama Dunkirk, and crashed a real 747 plane in the complex, divisive Tenet (2020). For Oppenheimer, he went one further – he recreated an atomic blast.\n\nIt was just one of the challenges Nolan set himself, to be able to create the film in the way he desired. That vision doesn’t depict the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs that caused such suffering and destruction – an estimated 129,000 to 226,000 people were killed by the two detonations, which left a lasting trauma that still affects Japan (and, one could say, the entire world). To this day, Western filmmakers have only partially engaged with the true horrors of the atomic bombings. This is Nolan’s interpretation of Oppenheimer’s story.\n\nCillian Murphy and Christopher Nolan on the ‘Oppenheimer’ set (Universal)\n\nFor Murphy, it’s a big moment in his movie career. Earlier this month, he listened on as his Oppenheimer co-star Robert Downey Jr told him that his life would change now that he had been cast as the lead in “this huge film”. The suggestion, though, that this is Murphy’s breakout role was confusing to some. After all, the actor burst onto the scene more than two decades ago with his appearance in Danny Boyle’s post-apocalyptic horror 28 Days Later (2002). Since then, he’s gained worldwide recognition as the face of Steven Knight’s period gangster show Peaky Blinders, released on the BBC in the UK and on Netflix practically everywhere else. What did Murphy make of Downey Jr’s suggestion?\n\n“Honestly, and I know every actor says this ad nauseam, but I don’t think about it,” he explains. “Peaky Blinders is a phenomenon – it’s all over the world and people adore it – but you can never think about that ancillary aspect of the work, because then you wouldn’t do it properly.”\n\nAccess unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trial Sign up\n\nAccess unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trial Sign up\n\nNolan’s “encyclopaedic” knowledge of Oppenheimer protected Murphy from becoming too aware of any pressures his director was facing. Instead, he searched for a way to “connect with and find the truth” of Oppenheimer “in every moment” of the film. In preparation, the actor watched David Lean’s 1962 epic (and noted Nolan favourite) Lawrence of Arabia “in terms of the scale and the life-story aspect”. Also on the homework list was Miloš Forman’s Amadeus (1984), “because of Salieri and Mozart, that kind of competitive relationship”, which was echoed in Oppenheimer’s dealings with the slippery philanthropist Lewis Strauss (Downey Jr), an increasingly obstructive figure in Oppenheimer’s life in the years following his creation of the bomb.\n\nI don’t make films so I can look at myself. I really don’t. Having said that, I did want to watch this movie with an audience, as that’s how it’s designed Cillian Murphy\n\nThe remainder of Murphy’s supporting cast, a who’s who of Hollywood, all deliver. There’s Matt Damon on surly form as Manhattan Project director Leslie Groves, Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer’s admirably patient wife Kitty, and Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock, the psychiatrist who had an extramarital affair with Oppenheimer. The multitude of physicist roles (there are a lot) are played by actors including Josh Hartnett, Benny Safdie, David Krumholtz and Kenneth Branagh – and for good measure, there’s even Tom Conti as Albert Einstein, and Gary Oldman playing yet another world leader after his portrayal of Churchill in Darkest Hour: the American president Harry S Truman.\n\nIt was the assembling of this huge ensemble around Murphy that helped to convey the grandiosity Nolan was after. “Scale in cinema is a peculiar thing,” he says. “Does it come from actions and effects? Or does it come from the most exciting actors of the day coming together to tell a story that’s about the moment the world changes for ever?”\n\nIndeed, for such an expensive film, Oppenheimer is surprisingly dialogue-heavy. Reviews have compared the scenes that focus on the hearings exploring Oppenheimer’s involvement in the Manhattan Project with similar ones in Oliver Stone’s JFK (1991) and Nixon (1995) – and there’s more than a little Alan J Pakula and Sidney Lumet in the film’s political intrigue. It’s also filled to the brim with unsettling close-ups; in some scenes, it feels as if you’d be able to touch Murphy’s chiselled cheekbones should you reach out and try.\n\nHowever, he bristles at the reminder that his face will be blasted on cinema screens around the world – in Imax, no less – all summer long. “I love watching Christopher Nolan’s films when I’m not in them,” he says. “You don’t have to freak out about the size of your ears or whatever. I don’t make films so I can look at myself. I really don’t. Having said that, I did want to watch this movie with an audience, as that’s how it’s designed.”\n\nIt’s how every Nolan film is designed. But with great power comes greater need for box office success. This could be seen as a corollary of making such large films, and I ask Nolan if he feels that this becomes reductive when it comes to measuring the true success of a release. “I don’t have an honest answer to that question,” he says, before tackling it rather honestly.\n\nCillian Murphy in ‘Oppenheimer’ (Melinda Sue Gordon)\n\n“It’s a combination of factors. My impulse is to tell a story, but I’m not a filmmaker who works in a vacuum. I’m not a filmmaker who purely makes a film for themselves. I make a film that I want to experience with an audience, and I make them at budget levels where you really have to try and find the widest crowd. I enjoy that form of communication. I think the Hollywood blockbuster, at its best, can reach people in a way that few other forms, including other forms of movies, really can, all around the world. Beyond that, box office numbers tend to be a little bit of an abstraction.”\n\nThe project marked a significant departure for the writer-director: it’s his first film centred on a real-life figure. Despite having American Prometheus as a resource, he found that he still had to grapple with the extent of Oppenheimer’s brainpower. This is why the middle section of the film – focused on the construction of a top-secret lab in the New Mexico desert where Oppenheimer and his team could design, and test, the bomb – came as a relief to Nolan.\n\n“Oppenheimer had a whole other level of intellect than anyone we know, but it was useful to see him named as the director, literally, of the Los Alamos lab, and realise that what he had to do, in those three years, was bring together this disparate group of talents. He wasn’t the smartest person there, but he was the guy bringing everyone together to get the most out of their talents. That’s absolutely what I have to do as a director.”\n\nChristopher Nolan behind the scenes of ‘Oppenheimer’ (Melinda Sue Gordon)\n\nDespite making blockbusters that require him to spin hundreds of plates for an extended amount of time, Nolan is showing no signs of burnout. He is a director who consistently releases new films every three years, often commencing work on the next one months after completing the last. Will this regularity continue going forward? It seems a break is not on the horizon just yet. “I find it hard to imagine not wanting to make films,” he says, a childlike enthusiasm momentarily cutting through the seriousness. “I will do this for as long as somebody would support me in doing it.”\n\nWhenever that project comes to fruition, you can bet Murphy will “always say yes” should Nolan give him the call – even if it means having to endure seeing his face projected on giant screens. “No project is risk-free, but if you’re working with one of the greatest living filmmakers, I think you’ve got a good shot at knowing it’s going to be good.”\n\nBut the wait might be a little longer once Oppenheimer is released. Nolan acknowledges that following a project of this scale will take some doing. “It gets a bit more challenging to find subject matters that are different enough and also build on what you’ve learnt as a filmmaker, so you slow down to a degree. But I love filmmaking, and in terms of budget, I would do it at whatever level I was able to. It’s something I’ll always do.”\n\n‘Oppenheimer’ is in cinemas now"

        "text": "After much anticipation, Christopher Nolan's first biographical project, Oppenheimer, was released in theatres on 21 July 2023. As expected, the film received excellent reviews, just like most of his previous projects. Known for creating thought-provoking cinematic marvels, Nolan has once again hit the ball out of the park with Oppenheimer. Despite tough competition from Greta Gerwig's fantasy drama Barbie, the movie has exceeded expectations by minting $80.5 million on the opening weekend alone, according to Variety.\n\nMade on a budget of $180 million (Rs 1476+ Crore), Oppenheimer stars a pool of talented actors like Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh, and Rami Malek among others. While these stars went all out to promote the biographical drama, Nolan, joined the bandwagon too and answered some intriguing questions which varied from his personal life to the filmmaking process, the source of ideas for his movies to the personalities who influenced his work, and more. Scroll down to learn more about the interesting revelations made by the ace filmmaker in recent interviews.\n\nFrom working with Cillian Murphy to his thoughts on directing a Star Wars movie, 7 interesting revelations made by Christopher Nolan in recent interviews\n\n1. On his equation with Cillian Murphy\n\nOppenheimer marks Christopher Nolan's sixth collaboration with Irish actor Cillian Murphy. The actor-director duo have teamed up in the past to deliver critically acclaimed films like Batman Begins (2005), The Dark Knight (2008), Inception (2010), The Dark Knight Rises (2012), and Dunkirk (2017). Calling Murphy an 'old friend', Nolan, revealed some exciting details about the former that'll leave you surprised. Talking about their first meeting, Nolan, in interaction with Wired, said, “Met him first when he screen tested for Batman, and I think we both kind of knew he probably wasn't right for the role (of Batman), but his test was so exciting that the studio was okay for me to cast him as the villain”.\n\n\"Cillian is one of the greatest actors of his generation or any other, and we've done six films together. And this is the first time I got to use him as the leading man\", he further added."

Pero creo que también tenía la humildad necesaria para sobrevivir interpretando un papel como éste”, declaró Downey Jr. a People.\n\nTe puede interesar: “Duna: parte 2” revela nuevos pósters con Timothée Chalamet y Zendaya en el centro de la acción\n\nEl actor continuó asegurando que Cillian se comprometió tanto con el papel que se aisló del resto del elenco para aprender holandés. Curiosamente, esto fue para una escena de menos de un minuto de duración en la que, precisamente, Oppenheimer brinda una conferencia en holandés asegurando que lo aprendió en tan sólo unas semanas.\n\n“Nos decíamos: ‘Oye, tenemos un fin de semana de tres días. Quizá vayamos a Santa Fe a comprar antigüedades. ¿Qué vas a hacer?’ ‘Oh, tengo que aprender 30.000 palabras en holandés. Pásalo bien’. Pero así son las cosas”.\n\nPara su papel como Oppenheimer, Cillian Murphy tuvo que aprender 30 mil palabras en holandés (© Universal Studios. All Rights Reserved)\n\nSin embargo, los idiomas son sólo la punta del iceberg. Hace unos días, Florence Pugh, quien da vida a la amante de Oppenheimer, Jean Tatlock, aseguró que Cillian se sometió a una dieta estricta en la que sólo comía una almendra al día. El mismo actor confirmó que llevó su cuerpo a límites no muy saludables como un reto personal, algo que no le recomienda a otros actores.\n\nTe puede interesar: Murió Benjamin Zephaniah: “Peaky Blinders” y el legado artístico del activista británico\n\n“Es como si estuvieras en un maldito tren que va a toda velocidad. Es bang, bang, bang, bang. Duermes unas horas, te levantas y lo vuelves a hacer. Tenía una energía de locos; superé un umbral en el que no me preocupaba por la comida ni por nada... Pero era bueno porque el personaje era así. Nunca comía (...) Te vuelves un poco competitivo contigo mismo, lo que no es sano. No lo aconsejo”.\n\nCillian Murphy también aseguró que llevó su cuerpo hasta limites poco sanos\n\nMas recientemente, Florence Pugh aseguró que Cillian era un actor con el que estaba “desesperada por trabajar”.\n\n“Chris tenía en Cillian a uno de los protagonistas más increíbles. Es un actor al que he estado observando durante bastante tiempo y con el que he estado desesperada por trabajar. Habría que estar loco para decir que no. Ha sido realmente una de las mejores experiencias que he tenido”, afirmó.\n\nFlorence Pugh reconoció que deseaba trabajar con Cillian Murphy\n\n“Trabajar con él fue enormemente impresionante”, continúa la actriz de 27 años. “Cada día se presenta sabiendo todas las formas, entonaciones e inflexiones posibles para dar vida al personaje. Eso me impresionó muchísimo. Por algo es uno de los grandes”.\n\nTomando en cuenta todo el sacrificio que Cillian Murphy hizo para darle vida a un Robert Oppenheimer completamente trastornado, todo parece indicar que la Academia ya tiene un favorito para la próxima edición de los premios Oscar.\n\nSeguir leyendo:"

        "text": "As “Barbenheimer” mania continues, there has been a major shift in the Oscar predictions for Best Director. According to the predictions of the Expert journalists we’ve surveyed from major media outlets, Christopher Nolan (“Oppenheimer“) now has an ever-so-slight edge against Martin Scorsese (“Killers of the Flower Moon“) for Best Director.\n\nAs of this writing 10 of those elite journos are betting on Nolan to prevail for his work on the biographical drama about the father of the atomic bomb. Compare that to nine who say Scorsese is out front. Thus far they are the only two directors with Experts predicting them to win the Oscar.\n\nOf course, it’s early yet. We might see the pendulum swing back to Scorsese when “Killers of the Flower Moon” releases in October. Or another director could swoop in and usurp the front-runner position from both of them. But right now Nolan is in a particularly strong position.\n\nHe hasn’t won an Oscar yet, which gives him the same king of overdue narrative that Scorsese had when he finally won Best Director for “The Departed” (2006) — though Scorsese waited longer for his first trophy than Nolan has had to. And “Oppenheimer” has that rare trifecta of important subject matter (the moral quandaries surrounding the atomic bomb during World War II), critical adoration (88 on MetaCritic, 94% freshness on Rotten Tomatoes), and box office success ($400 million globally after 10 days of release).\n\n“Oppenheimer” is a relatively early release, though, which is often a disadvantage since the Oscars typically prefer the fall films that are freshest in mind, but that didn’t hurt “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” which just swept the Oscars despite opening way back in March of 2022.\n\nWe’ll have more Experts weighing in on the Oscar race as the season progresses, so no filmmaker’s position is ever totally fixed, especially when the race is this close this early.

        "text": "Barbie, directed by Greta Gerwig, remained a runaway number one at the US box office in its fourth week, bringing in $33.7 million, according to studio estimates Sunday. The Margot Robbie-led and produced film from Warner Bros, still in 4,137 theaters, refused to drop off as most box-office toppers have this year, surpassing $500 million in North America overall a week after it crossed the $1 billion mark globally — a record for a female director. (Also Read | Justin Trudeau watches Oppenheimer with daughter after catching a Barbie show with son) Margot Robbie in Barbie (left) and Cillian Murphy in a still from Oppenheimer.\n\nThe second half of the Barbenheimer duo, Oppenheimer, returned to the number two spot in its own fourth week after a week at number three overall. The Christopher Nolan-directed film from Universal Pictures brought in $18.8 million from 3,761 locations for an overall domestic total of $264.3 million.\n\nStay tuned with breaking news on HT Channel on Facebook. Join Now\n\nThe top pair had thin competition. The week's only major wide release, Universal's The Last Voyage of the Demeter, finished fifth with a $6.5 million opening weekend.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, in its second week, earned $15.6 million domestically for third place, and the Jason Statham shark sequel, Meg 2: The Trench, brought in $12.7 million, dropping from second to fifth in its second week in theatres.\n\nBarbie is poised to become 2023’s top film. Its $526.3 million domestic total and $1.18 billion global bankroll currently sits second behind The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which earned $574.2 million in North America, and $1.358 billion globally in the spring. It's also the second-highest-grossing film in the history of Warner Bros, behind only 2011’s Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.\n\nThe sustained performance of the Mattel movie continues to flip the script on what had been a weak year in theatres, with major sequels underperforming including Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny and Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part I, which remained in the top 10 this week with $4.7 million.\n\n\"Barbie is as hot a commodity as it was in its first week. It's just ensconced at the No. 1 spot, and I don’t know if it’s going anywhere soon,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. “And Oppenheimer right there with it. They’re just drafting off each other in this box office NASCAR race.”\n\nThe midsummer Barbenheimer put the industry-wide summer total ahead of 2022. It was lagging behind just a month ago. “If you think of what Barbie and Oppenheimer together — just those two movies — have contributed in these weekends at the box office, it’s really a staggering number,\" Paul said.\n\nAll movies combined this summer have earned $3.63 billion in North America. With significant releases remaining in August, including DC Comics' Blue Beetle, the video game adaptation Gran Turismo, and the Denzel Washington sequel The Equalizer 3, the box office has a chance of reaching the $4 billion that was considered a domestic benchmark for a strong summer before the pandemic.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at US and Canadian theatres, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.\n\n1. Barbie, $33.7 million.\n\n2. Oppenheimer, $18.8 million.\n\n3. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, $15.6 million.\n\n4. Meg 2: The Trench, $12.7 million.\n\n5. The Last Voyage of the Demeter, $6.5 million.\n\n6. Haunted Mansion, $5.6 million.\n\n7. Talk to Me, $5.1 million.\n\n8. Sound of Freedom, $4.8 million.\n\n9. Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part I, $4.7 million.\n\n10. Jailer, 2.6 million."

        "text": "Since Oppenheimer's release, people have gone gaga over the big and loud spectacle that Christopher Nolan created. Many who aren't well-versed in science or physics for that matter found the movie entertaining and touching. Even though people have enjoyed the movie to the fullest, there are some amazing scenes in the film that many may have missed. Read on\n\nOppenheimer actually did try to poison his professor once\n\nThe film's opening scene introduces us to a young Oppenheimer buzzing with ideas as he embarks on his physics studies across Europe. While at Cambridge and grappling with severe depression, he becomes increasingly frustrated with his highly critical instructor, Patrick Blackett. Stricken by a surge of anger, the future father of the atomic bomb injects a deadly dose of potassium cyanide into an apple and puts it on the professor's desk. There was no need to worry as he immediately realizes his mistake and rushes back to the classroom to remove the poisoned apple, only to encounter his idol, Niels Bohr holding it.\n\nWater plays an important role in the film\n\nWater assumes a nuanced yet significant role in the film. The movie's introduction presents Oppenheimer amidst rainfall, his gaze fixed upon the puddles forming and splashing at his feet. This initial scene is swiftly disrupted by one of his catastrophic visions, portraying the world consumed by towering flames. Another moment involves Einstein and Oppenheimer standing by a pond at Princeton, potentially seeking respite from the havoc his invention brought on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nALSO READ: Cillian Murphy reveals THIS is the reason he didn't pursue music career\n\nWhy are some scenes in color and others in black & white?\n\nSimilar to Christopher Nolan's second movie Memento, Oppenheimer uses a combination of color and black-and-white scenes. His fans will recognize that the color difference serves the same purpose as in the earlier film i.e. to distinguish between two distinct past and present. The black-and-white sequences are situated post the Manhattan Project.\n\nThe metaphor behind the black hole research\n\nEarly in the film, before being recruited for the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer's focus is on studying black holes and neutron stars. In the scene where he's talking about Black holes with Jean Tatlock, on being asked about his study, he explains he's exploring \"how stars die,\" noting, \"the bigger the star, the more dramatic its demise.\" This line may have served to be a metaphor for Oppenheimer's life.\n\nGeneral Leslie Groves's promotions thorough out the movie\n\nDuring the Manhattan Project, Groves' promotions has been conveyed through his uniform changes. At his first meeting with Oppenheimer, he's a colonel, but he informs the scientist of his promotion to general for project contributions. The film subtly depicts his progression from brigadier, to major general through uniform. He retired as an honorary lieutenant general, as seen during the security hearings scene.\n\nALSO READ: Cillian Murphy recalls receiving Christopher Nolan’s call for Oppenheimer: ‘It was kind of euphoric’"

        "text": "“20 anos atrás, quando comecei a trabalhar com Cillian [Murphy], já ficou aparente para mim que ele era um dos grandes atores… da sua geração ou de qualquer outra”. As palavras são de Christopher Nolan, que fez cinco filmes com o astro irlandês de Peaky Blinders - começando com Batman Begins, em 2005 - antes de escalá-lo como protagonista em Oppenheimer.\n\n“Quando este filme começou a tomar forma, eu liguei para ele imediatamente”, comenta ainda o cineasta, em entrevista ao Omelete. “Disse: 'Esse é o nosso projeto. Você estará no centro do palco, e terá que carregar o público junto com você pelos altos e baixos dessa história'. Por sorte, ele estava pronto para o desafio.”\n\nNas palavras do próprio Murphy, assumir o centro do palco em um filme do seu parceiro de longa data foi a realização de um sonho. “Eu passei muito mais tempo no set dessa vez!”, brinca. “Eu e Chris trabalhamos muito juntos, inclusive por seis meses antes do começo das filmagens. A nossa colaboração foi muito mais estreita dessa vez do que nos outros filmes que fizemos juntos, o que foi uma ótima experiência.”\n\nO ator comenta ainda que a chave para entender seu Oppenheimer está em duas coisas: a voz e o figurino - especialmente por que o físico que criou a bomba atômica era conhecido como uma espécie de “rockstar” da comunidade científica.\n\n“Nós trabalhamos muito na fisicalidade do personagem”, relata Murphy. “Ele era um homem charmoso, carismático - as mulheres o adoravam. Acho que, no fundo, ele sabia muito bem desse apelo que ele tinha, e criou uma imagem que se aproveitava disso... se você pensar na forma como ele se apresentava, com o chapéu e o cachimbo, foi tudo pensado nesse sentido.\"\n\nOppenheimer, enfim, pode marcar o ápice da parceria de diretor e astro, mas com certeza não marca o fim dela. “Em todo esse tempo que eu conheço Cillian, ele cresceu muito como artista, fez trabalhos que o desafiaram e aperfeiçoaram suas habilidades. Ele é um ator espetacular com o qual trabalhar, além de um grande amigo meu. É sempre um prazer estar com ele”, define Nolan.\n\n“Eu confesso que não fico premeditando quais papéis quero fazer no futuro, ou algo do tipo. A minha carreira é meio aleatória nesse sentido”, admite Murphy. “A minha estrela-guia é a vontade de trabalhar com as melhores pessoas possíveis... até por isso Oppenheimer foi tão interessante para mim. Não só Chris é um dos melhores diretores de cinema vivos, na minha opinião, como esse elenco é fenomenal. Esse é o tipo de trabalho que vale a pena para mim.”\n\nOppenheimer já está em cartaz nos cinemas brasileiros."
