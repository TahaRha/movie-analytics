        "text": "In an interview with Variety last month, director Steven Soderbergh suggested that the increased presence of technology has made it more difficult to create tension in movies.\n\n\"Cellphones are the worst thing that's ever happened to movies. ... It's so hard to manufacture drama when everybody can get a hold of everybody all the time,\" Soderbergh said.\n\nHowever, Christopher McQuarrie, director of the most recent \"Mission: Impossible\" film faces this problem head-on. McQuarrie takes the increased use of technology and makes it the villain in \"Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,\" which releases Wednesday, June 12.\n\nThe seventh \"Mission: Impossible\" film pits Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt against an artificial intelligence machine known as The Entity. The machine's wide-reaching presence makes it difficult for Hunt and his team to use their usual advanced forms of technology as they race to defeat The Entity before any country can take control of it.\n\n'Dead Reckoning' highlights Cruise's star power\n\nReturning to Hunt's team are Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). Hunt also teams up with newcomer Hayley Atwell, who is known only by the name Grace in the film.\n\nAmid this cast, Cruise is the tentpole that holds up this film. Although the mission is still exciting, Cruise is the sole factor that should drive you to see \"Dead Reckoning.\"\n\nCruise has become famous for doing his own stunts, and he does not let up in this film, which has some spectacular sequences. The entire last segment of the movie, set on a train, had my jaw dropping lower and lower with each scene.\n\nAnd Cruise shines particularly well with McQuarrie, who directed Cruise in the previous two \"Mission: Impossible\" movies and worked on the screenplay for 2022's $1.5 billion hit \"Top Gun: Maverick.\" The pair has been collaborating since McQuarrie wrote \"Valkyrie\" in 2008, and it's a duo I hope will never end.\n\nCruise is the man Steven Spielberg said saved Hollywood, and it's obvious why in \"Dead Reckoning.\" Cruise, personal life aside, was born to be a star.\n\nAI scare runs strong in Cruise's new mission\n\n\"Dead Reckoning\" feels extremely timely, releasing at a time when AI services like ChatGPT and image generators are making people wary of the future of technology. The film takes this fear and capitalizes on it by making The Entity the central antagonist.\n\nMcQuarrie, who also wrote the film, runs wild with his ideas about AI, trying to ensure no one in the audience will be on board with the concept by the end of the film. Throughout the film, The Entity – who has a striking resemblance to Hal 9000 from \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (1968) – plays tricks on the team, causing them to question what's real.\n\nThis isn't the first time Cruise has had to go up against AI either. In 2021, one person impersonated Cruise with deepfake videos. And this year, another posted an AI-generated picture of Cruise with two lookalike \"stunt doubles.\"\n\n\"Dead Reckoning\" is a treat for anyone who's seen the previous \"Mission: Impossible\" films. Many of the series' iconic parts return here, from the intricate and realistic tearaway masks to the frequent use of slanted Dutch angle shots.\n\nAnd if the \"Part One\" in the film's title is making you hesitate to watch this film in fear of an unfulfilling cliffhanger, don't worry. The film has a solid conclusion that won't leave you feeling robbed."

        "text": "I don’t know if anyone has ever clocked whether Tom Cruise is faster than a speeding bullet. The guy has legs, and guts. His sprints into the near-void have defined and sustained his stardom, becoming his singular superpower. He racks up more miles in “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” the seventh entry in a 27-year-old franchise that repeatedly affirms a movie truism. That is, there are few sights more cinematic than a human being outracing danger and even death onscreen — it’s the ultimate wish fulfillment!\n\nMuch remains the same in this latest adventure, including the series’ reliable entertainment quotient and Cruise’s stamina. Once again, he plays Ethan Hunt, the leader of a hush-hush American spy agency, the Impossible Mission Force. Alongside a rotating roster of beautiful kick-ass women (most recently Rebecca Ferguson and Vanessa Kirby) and loyal handymen (Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames), Ethan has been sprinting, flying, diving and speed-racing across the globe while battling enemy agents, rogue operatives, garden-variety terrorists and armies of minions. Along the way, he has regularly delivered a number of stomach-churning wows, like jumping out a window and climbing the world’s tallest building.\n\nThis time, the villain is the very au courant artificial intelligence, here called the Entity. The whole thing is complicated, as these stories tend to be, with stakes as catastrophic as recent news headlines have trumpeted. Or, as an open letter signed by 350 A.I. authorities put it last month: “Mitigating the risk of extinction from A.I. should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks, such as pandemics and nuclear war.” In the face of such calamity, who you gonna call? Analog Man, that’s who, a.k.a. Mr. Hunt, who receives his usual mysterious directives that, this time, have been recorded on a cassette tape, an amusing touch for a movie about the threat poised to the material world by a godlike digital power.\n\nThat’s all fine and good, even if the most memorable villain proves to be a Harley Quinn-esque agent of chaos, Paris (Pom Klementieff), who races after Ethan in a Hummer and seems ready to spin off into her own franchise. She tries flattening him during a seamlessly choreographed chase sequence in Rome — the stunt coordinator, Wade Eastwood, is also a racecar driver — that mixes excellent wheel skills with scares, laughs, thoughtful geometry and precision timing. At one point, Ethan ends up behind the wheel while handcuffed to a new love interest, Grace (Hayley Atwell, another welcome addition), driving and drifting, flirting and burning rubber in what is effectively the action-movie equivalent of a sex scene."

        "text": "At the end of the apocalypse, after the sun has fried every flower and tree, as the last skyscraper turns to dust, when each extant cockroach has gone belly-up with x’es for eyes, there will be one man standing tall, or somewhat tall: Tom Cruise is forever, and if that idea may have seemed mortifying 40-odd years ago, when he was mugging his way through thinly disguised navy recruitment ads or grinning and grinding in his skivvies to Bob Seger’s “Old Time Rock & Roll,” it’s more palatable now. Cruise has never been a great or subtle actor, but he has grown into a perfectly watchable one, and that has come to mean more at a time when the movies are shrinking, literally and metaphorically. He’s the star attraction of the seventh Mission: Impossible film, Dead Reckoning Part One, and he carries the film ably on his back, along with his always-at-the-ready parachute. Cruise, still in love with what big mainstream movies used to be, has become a chivalric dreamer, striving to ensure their survival by sheer will. Maybe he can pull it off and maybe he can’t. But at least there’s some pleasure to be had in watching him try.\n\nIf you’re fond of MacGuffins, you’ll love Dead Reckoning Part One, whose central thingie is a two-piece key that can be used to control an instance of artificial intelligence gone rogue, a manmade smarty-pants that has beehived into an all-seeing, all-knowing, all-powerful entity known, cleverly, as the Entity. Basically, it’s all just an excuse for Cruise—returning as Impossible Mission Force veteran Ethan Hunt—to do stuff like ride motorcycles off cliffs and drive teeny-tiny cars down Rome’s Spanish Steps. Cruise’s devotion to practical action and his insistence on doing most of his own stunts, many of them quite dangerous, are already the stuff of legend, or at least a bunch of press releases, and it’s not giving too much away to say that the plot of Dead Reckoning Part One—directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who has been pulling the franchise’s various strings and levers since 2015’s Rogue Nation—is virtually unfollowable after about the first third. The story exists only as flimsy interstitial tissue between the Tom-centric stunts, but maybe that’s enough. Ostensibly greater movies have given us less.\n\nCruise, doing the stunts himself Courtesy of Paramount Pictures\n\nAll you need to know going in, really, is that every woman for whom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt expresses even the tiniest bit of affection is doomed. But not right away, which means that Dead Reckoning brings back Rebecca Ferguson’s silky-steely Ilsa Faust, of the most engaging characters from the franchise’s last two entries, Fallout (2018) and Rogue Nation (2015). She, apparently, has one-half of the much-desired-by-many-parties key, which makes her a target of, well, everybody: We first see in her in the corner of the world where she’s been hiding out, the Arabian Desert near Yemen. Ethan shows up on horseback, a dazzling sight wrapped in scarves and goggles designed to shield him from the swirly, sandy wind. There’s an encounter, and an event. Shortly thereafter, the action shifts to IMF headquarters (“the other IMF,” as one character quips wryly), where zillions of workers in suits are rushing to make hard copies of digital information—on typewriters. You could make a whole movie about that and plenty of people would be happy, but admittedly, it would be rather low on action.\n\nCruise as Ethan Hunt, flying through the air on a motorcycle Courtesy of Paramount Pictures\n\nAs it is, the action in Dead Reckoning zips from the desert to the office to Rome to Venice to the Austrian Alps—the locations alone are transportive, even if the plot is a mess. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames return as Ethan’s sidekicks Benji and Luther, and the three of them make almost as many solemn pronouncements about loyalty and family and friendship as Vin Diesel does in the Fast and Furious movies. Ethan stands by his team; he’s willing, he reminds us more than once, to die for them, and that includes any newbie who might enter the fold. In this case, that would be Hayley Atwell’s Grace, a pickpocket extraordinaire and sleight-of-hand expert who, at any given point in the movie, may or may not have the all-important half-key. The point is to keep it out of the hands of Ethan’s adversaries, which include Vanessa Kirby’s Alanna, AKA the White Widow, and an acrobatic assassin, Paris, played by Pom Klementieff. Ethan’s biggest enemy, though, is evil silver fox Gabriel (Esai Morales), who seeks the key to unleash chaos upon the world. Or something.\n\nAnd the stunts! Isn’t that really what it’s all about? They include, but are not limited to, a gorgeously staged duel between Faust and Gabriel, set on a slender Venetian bridge: Faust wears a silky topcoat whose tails whirl about her as her sword slashes through the air, intensifying the already intense aura of Venetian mystery and drama. There is that business with the almost-miniature vintage Fiat 500 and the Spanish Steps, though rest assured, no Spanish Steps were harmed in the making of this film. The movie’s last third or so takes place in and around—but also, of course, atop—the Orient Express as it steams through the Alps. That section, already detailed in promotional videos for the film, also features Cruise speedflying—not to be confused with skydiving—over jagged mountain terrain. It’s beautiful, and it does look pretty dangerous.\n\nEsai Morales and Tom Cruise fighting atop a moving train in 'Dead Reckoning Part One' Courtesy of Paramount Pictures\n\nCruise has invested a great deal of emotional energy in making sure we know it’s really him doing these stunts, and you can’t blame him. In a green-screen movie world, where the idea of excitement, if not the thing itself, can be filled in long after filming is done, it’s rare to be able to watch a human being move like this. Cruise is muscular, feisty, nimble—but he does have bones, like everyone else, and those bones are now 61 years old. He’s the last survivor of his generation of action stars. Nicolas Cage and Bruce Willis have moved on, by necessity or choice, but Cruise still wants to do some version of what he has always done, whether it’s flying, running, or wrestling down random baddies on top of a moving train. Ethan Hunt is a grave presence—a recurring flashback in Dead Reckoning features snippets of a murder that looms large in his psyche, apparently influencing his every move. But Cruise doesn’t have a naturally grave persona; he has to work at it, and so he does.\n\nAt a certain point in Dead Reckoning, Ethan is required to smile at one of the women in his orbit. She has just said something nice to him, or about him, and he must respond appropriately. So he stiffens his jaw ever so slightly, and his eyes crinkle like those of a painted Santa. This expression of veiled gratitude, of being a sturdy guy who knows it’s better not to show much emotion, takes some effort, and you can see Cruise working to deliver. But even this not-quite-a-smile takes muscle and nerve. Think of it as a microstunt, less dangerous, certainly, than riding a motorcycle off a cliff, but a bit of risky business in its own right.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com."

        "text": "Tom Cruise made an impassioned speech about cinemagoing from Rome’s Spanish Steps at the world premiere of “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One.”\n\n“There is a community that we are all part of — different cultures and ways of life, we all join together to enjoy cinema,” said Cruise, dressed in a crisp blue suit and wearing aviator shades. “It’s something that I grew up with, that made me and inspired me to dream and want to travel the world.\n\n“My goal since I was little was to make movies and travel. And not just be a tourist, but work in that world and understand their culture. Through my movies, I’ve been able to have that because everyone here has allowed me to entertain them. It’s a privilege that I have never taken for granted. It’s my passion to entertain you, and I will always fight for big theaters and that kind of experience for everyone.”\n\nCruise also paid tribute to his “Mission: Impossible” director Christopher McQuarrie, calling the helmer his “creative brother.”\n\n“He’s had a hand in every single film I’ve made over the past 16 years,” Cruise declared. “Uncredited, he wrote ‘Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol.” He’s had a hand in editing and writing every single I’ve ever done. He is my creative brother and an exceptional human being.”\n\nTom Cruise (left) paid tribute to director Christopher McQuarrie (right) from the Spanish Steps red carpet in Rome.\n\nCruise, who reprises his role as Ethan Hunt in Paramount’s latest tentpole, added: “I want to thank Rome and the city. And also we got to film in Venice, which was extraordinary, during some very difficult times in this country. I dreamed to be coming here and [sharing] it with all of you.”\n\nThe seventh installment of the “Mission: Impossible” franchise was partly filmed in the Italian capital, where the cobblestoned streets provided the perfect pavement for drifting cars burning rubber in numerous hair-raising chases that are likely to go down in action film history. The Spanish Steps, by the Piazza di Spagna, is the setting of a wild car chase involving a massive Hummer chasing a tiny vintage yellow Fiat 500 driven by Cruise and Hayley Atwell, who are handcuffed.\n\nOn those very steps, Cruise — who spent the weekend in Rome ahead of the premiere — wooed crowds screaming “Tom! Tom!” on the sunny Monday afternoon.\n\nCruise came to Italy with director McQuarrie and an ensemble cast of returning talents including Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson and Vanessa Kirby on the red carpet. Franchise newcomers Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis were also among those who made the trek to the Eternal City for the launch.\n\nAtwell, who plays thief and agent of chaos Grace, told Variety during a weekend junket that she trained for months on a race track with stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood for her Rome chase. Only after her hardcore training did she arrive in Rome to work alongside Cruise, who was determined to keep the stunts as real as possible.\n\nHayley Atwell (right) joined Cruise for the world premiere of “Mission: Impossible 7.”\n\n“I was handcuffed to Tom Cruise, who is in the passenger seat,” Atwell recalled. “Both Wade and Tom said: ‘We want you to go in front of this monument, do some 360 doughnuts, drift in, drift out, dodge cars and keep going.'”\n\nDuring this feat, Atwell was told that “Tom’s going to be suggesting lines to you [while] he’s going to be acting as Ethan. But he also might give you moments of direction, too. Like: ‘turn left’ or ‘slow down,’” she said.\n\nSo Atwell’s challenge, as she was drifting, was to work out: “Is Tom as a producer telling me as Hayley to slow down because something is unsafe? Or is he as Ethan telling Grace to slow down?”\n\n“It was an amazing day,” Atwell noted. After it was over, McQuarrie took her out to lunch and said: ‘Tom put his life in your hands today. That was no small thing,’” she added.\n\nBy contrast, Pom Klementieff – who plays the psychopathic villain Paris – didn’t train at all for scenes in which she drives the Hummer in pursuit of the yellow Fiat as it comes darting down the ancient staircase filled with screaming people who are jumping and running.\n\nFor Klementieff, the hard part was “not having too much fun doing it,” she said during the junket. “I was trying not to laugh the whole time, because for me it was so funny to be chasing a Fiat [500] … in this crazy Hummer.”\n\n“ I had to tone it down a bit. I had to remember that I’m a villain,” she laughed. But Klementieff also noted “that some of that [irony] is in the movie, of course!”\n\nThe entire “Mission: Impossible 7” cast gathered in Rome for the movie’s long-awaited world premiere.\n\nParamount’s July 12 U.S. release of “Mission: Impossible 7” – which also shot in England, Abu Dhabi and Norway – was pushed back several times from its original planned 2021 launch date due to pandemic-related setbacks.\n\nIn February 2021, the movie was forced to halt production in Italy, days before its planned shoot in Venice, as the country contended with one of the highest COVID death rates in Europe.\n\n“It was an absolute miracle this movie was made in the height of COVID,” said Vanessa Kirby, who in the film reprises her role as the powerful arms dealer White Widow.\n\n“In every city we were in across the world, it was the middle of COVID,” she added. “So it was amazing that they got the system [COVID production protocol] in place — and Tom drove it.”"

        "text": "CNN —\n\nTom Cruise – he’s just like us.\n\nSpeaking in London ahead of the release of “Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One,” Cruise shared that, yes, he feels fear.\n\n“It’s not that I don’t get scared,” the actor said. “It’s that I don’t mind being scared.”\n\nAnd there ends our delusion.\n\nCruise, who famously does his own stunts, has put his body on the line time and again for the multibillion-dollar franchise. As superspy Ethan Hunt he’s dangled from the world’s tallest building, clung on to the outside of a plane during take-off, and performed a military-level high altitude, low opening (HALO) skydive no less than 100 times.\n\nIn the latest movie Cruise can be seen riding a motorcycle off a cliff before BASE jumping on to … actually, let’s keep this spoiler-free. The stunt was filmed in Norway back in 2020 on the first day of the film’s arduous, Covid-stricken production. It was one thing for Cruise to perform the stunt, quite another to watch, powerless to intervene, said writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, Cruise’s long-term creative partner affectionately known as “McQ.”\n\n“I was just staring at the crosshairs on the screen, and I was waiting to see blue – blue was the color of his parachute,” he recalled. “Once I saw blue, I was just making sure it was a square, because if it wasn’t a square, it meant there was a malfunction. There was no coming back from it.”\n\nCruise put his director through the experience six times to capture the stunt from all the necessary angles, which looks even more spectacular in the finished movie than the marketing material suggests.\n\nWith all that heart-in-mouth action, is McQuarrie still able to have fun? “It’s more fun to finish a ‘Mission Impossible’ movie, for sure,” he said. “It’s a huge relief when it’s all behind you and everybody’s safe.”\n\nTom Cruise and Rebecca Ferguson in \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One.\" Paramount Pictures\n\n“Dead Reckoning” sees “Mission: Impossible” lean into 21st century anxieties in the form of its villain. Dubbed The Entity, this faceless, stateless antagonist is an artificial intelligence capable of infiltrating pretty much any digital network to chaotic ends. (Yes, Tom Cruise hates streaming so much he’s now squaring up to an algorithm.)\n\nThe star was reluctant to say much about the AI baddie, but when CNN’s Becky Anderson caught up with the cast and crew in Abu Dhabi – the next stop on the film’s globetrotting promotional tour – McQuarrie was more candid.\n\n“We were talking about it probably in early 2018, as something that even a few years prior would have been an intellectual or an abstract idea,” he explained. “I felt that people were starting to become aware of the way information and information technology was affecting their lives.”\n\nAs for AI’s impact on the movie industry itself, McQuarrie was diplomatic. “Like any of the technologies that have been used in previous ‘Mission Impossible’ movies, it’s less about the technology and more about who’s using (it),” he said. “What we’re presenting here is just what happens when the technology potentially falls into the wrong hands.”\n\nGetting the gang back together: Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson and Tom Cruise in the seventh film in the \"Mission Impossible\" franchise. Paramount Pictures\n\nFor resident gadget man Benji Dunn, The Entity is “his worst nightmare,” shared actor Simon Pegg. A series veteran who’s known Cruise for 17 years, Pegg saw the actor-producer forced to go through more off-screen action than either would have liked when the film became the first major production impacted by Covid, while on location in Venice, Italy in February 2020.\n\n“We kind of wrote the rulebook on how to make a film in a pandemic,” he said. “The time that that took was challenging, because often we’d have to stop, and there’d be pauses in shooting, but we wanted to be as safe as possible.\n\n“Tom is never reckless with the stunts; with everything he’s always very careful. But that was a challenge. It took much longer than it would normally do. But I think it’s all up there on the screen.”\n\nPegg did point to one upside, however: because of lockdowns, the cast, which included newcomers Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff, bonded quickly.\n\nFor Klementieff, a childhood fan of “Mission Impossible,” it was “a dream come true” to sign on as Paris, who puts Hunt through his paces, including a thrilling hand-to-hand fight scene down a dark alley.\n\nDelivering a similarly athletic performance, Atwell described it as “an all-encompassing experience that asked everything of me physically,” adding, “I think I’ll probably never have the experience again.”\n\nEsai Morales and Tom Cruise in \"Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One.\" Christian Black/Paramount Pictures\n\nNever say never, because as the movie title suggests, Part Two is coming. “It was McQ’s idea,” said Cruise. “When we were there (on shoot) I was like, ‘remember, this is your idea.’ There’s so much story … it won’t be confined by one film.”\n\n“Everything is on track,” McQuarrie divulged of the sequel, slated for release in June 2024. “We’ve shot in Africa, we’ve shot in the Arctic, we’re back here in London. Everything is standing by for us to go back to work after we’re done promoting this movie.\n\n“We’ve done some amazing, amazing things – and the biggest is yet to come.”\n\nCruise, arguably working in a category of one when it comes to Hollywood action heroes, is only competing with himself these days. “I strive for excellence,” he said. “There’s always another story to tell, there’s always another mountain to climb. And I always feel like I can do it better.”\n\n“I’m not the kind of person that will beat myself up,” he added, “but I’m constantly working to become competent and strive to understand my craft and the world, and just keep pushing myself.”\n\nAs for what happens after Part Two, the cast and crew are keeping mum. “I have been misquoted many times – I don’t know what happens next,” said McQuarrie.\n\nPegg is a little surer about Cruise, Ethan Hunt and the franchise’s fate. “I don’t see this story stopping,” he said. “I think he’ll be jumping off things when he’s 100.”\n\n“Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One” is released in cinemas worldwide starting July 12."

It’s gonna happen.”\n\nHe continued, “Look, I’ve watched her career her whole life. She’s enormously talented, very charismatic. It’d be fun. She could do everything. She could do comedy, drama, action, suspense. She’s someone that really draws you in on the screen, on camera. So absolutely, it’s gonna happen.”\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Cruise explained that he’s always wanted to make movies for audiences, cinema, distributors and big screens.\n\n“I love that cinema experience, and this film was made for that,” he said on the carpet. “I’ve always been studying any new programs that they have and any way that I can engage an audience and make it more entertaining more immersive. Look, I have always wanted to make movies and travel the world, and to be able to have this opportunity now, this is what I wanna do.”\n\nMission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One hits theaters July 12."

        "text": "Tom Cruise launches Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning at UK premiere\n\nBy Steven McIntosh Entertainment reporter\n\nHow Tom Cruise scares his Mission Impossible crew\n\nTom Cruise launched the seventh instalment of the Mission: Impossible franchise at the film's London premiere on Thursday.\n\nThe actor described Dead Reckoning - Part One as the \"biggest moment\" of the film series to date.\n\nHis co-stars Simon Pegg, Hayley Atwell, Rebecca Ferguson and Vanessa Kirby joined him on the red carpet.\n\nCritics' reviews of the film will be published on 5 July, before the film's release on the 14th.\n\nCruise said the two-part film marked the \"culmination of all my skills\" and promised even those unfamiliar with the series would have an \"epic adventure\".\n\nMission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One sees him reprise his role of Ethan Hunt, as the Impossible Mission Force (IMF) set out to track down a terrifying new weapon that threatens humanity.\n\nReuters\n\nTom Cruise reprises his role as Ethan Hunt in the hugely successful franchise\n\nThe film was shot partly in the UK and features the usual death-defying stunts, including one in which Cruise jumps off a cliff on a motorcycle.\n\nSpeaking at the film's London premiere, he said that even as a child he had always wanted to make movies, and had devoted himself to taking on new challenges and learning new skills.\n\n\"Since I was a little kid, that's what I did,\" the 60-year-old told the PA news agency.\n\n\"When I was three or four years old I was jumping off my roof and climbing trees - I wanted to make movies, I wanted adventure, I wanted to travel the world.\n\n\"So that's what I do, I train - I really enjoy taking on different skills, to work to become competent in everything that I do.\"\n\nHe continued: \"It was actually years of training... because I fly jets, I fly helicopters, I fly aeroplanes. I'm a skydiver, I'm a parachuter, race cars, motorcycles.\n\n\"[This film] was a culmination of all my skills.... There's a lot going on there's a lot happening... [but] the most important part is getting the shot and getting the story across.\"\n\nPA Media\n\nVanessa Kirby, who also stars in the film, walked the red carpet in London ahead of its premiere\n\nThe process of shooting the film was hampered by Covid-19 lockdowns, with an audio recording of Cruise shouting at production staff for apparently flaunting guidelines leaked in December 2020.\n\n\"In 2020 there was a lot going on that was a huge challenge just trying to figure out how to make a film in those circumstances,\" he told PA.\n\n\"We kind of wrote the rulebook on how to do it and it was an extraordinary experience just sort of getting through - it made the shoot a little longer, but I think it's made the film better.\"\n\nEvery Mission: Impossible film in the franchise to date has made at least $180m at the worldwide box office.\n\nThe most successful so far is 2018's sixth instalment, Mission: Impossible - Fallout, which took $791m worldwide, although the early films were released at the turn of the millennium and their box office takings are not adjusted for inflation.\n\nCruise's other film credits include Oblivion, Vanilla Sky, Collateral, Jerry Maguire, Top Gun and its sequel Top Gun: Maverick.\n\nMore pictures from the premiere:\n\nReuters\n\nCruise spoke to the press at the film's premiere in Leicester Square\n\nReuters\n\nIndira Varma plays the head of an intelligence agency in the movie\n\nReuters\n\nActress Hayley Atwell's hand was kissed by her co-star Rebecca Ferguson as they walked the red carpet\n\nPA Media\n\nThe latest Mission: Impossible film is directed by Christopher McQuarrie\n\nPA Media\n\nActor Mark Gatiss plays another agency boss who, like Varma's character, is a member of the intelligence chiefs community\n\nReuters\n\nFranchise regular Simon Pegg posed for selfies with fans\n\nPA Media\n\nHayley Atwell starred in the Avengers and Doctor Strange films prior to the latest Mission: Impossible\n\nPA Media\n\nThe premiere was also attended by actress Amanda Abbington (centre), who walked the red carpet with her daughter and son\n\nPA Media\n\nOther special guests included model Sian Osborne and boxer David Haye\n\nPA Media\n\nThe film is released in UK cinemas on 10 July"

        "text": "Tom Cruise turns 61 on Monday, marking more than four decades since he broke on to the Hollywood scene and started his ascension to the mega-famous movie star we know today.\n\nBorn on July 3, 1962, in Syracuse, New York, Cruise got his start in bit movie parts before a breakout year in 1983, in which he starred in All the Right Moves, The Outsiders, and his breakthrough hit, Risky Business.\n\nBut it was in the 1990s when Cruise began to hit his stride as box office magic. From 1992-96, he made history when he starred in five consecutive movies that grossed $100 million or more in the United States: A Few Good Men, The Firm, Interview With the Vampire, Mission: Impossible and Jerry Maguire.\n\nHis starring role as Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible has also been a blockbuster boon. So far, the franchise's six films have grossed over $3 billion worldwide, with the seventh -- Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One -- coming to theaters July 12.\n\n\"It's unbelievable,\" Cruise told ET while premiering Dead Reckoning in Rome last month. \"I do pinch myself every day.... It's something that I've never taken for granted ... I just feel very privileged.\"\n\nAnd then, of course, there's Top Gun. The iconic original flyboy flick was the highest-grossing domestic film in 1986, and when Cruise returned to the role of Capt. Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell last year for Top Gun: Maverick, it was a triumph in more ways than one. The film became Cruise's first to earn over a billion dollars worldwide and was a major success for movie theaters just starting to dig their way out of COVID shutdown difficulties.\n\n\"I make movies for audiences,\" the actor told ET. \"I work so hard and I think about them the whole time and when you see how excited they are and how much they appreciate it - it's just beautiful.\"\n\nIn total, the man often referred to as \"the last true movie star\" has made himself a $10 billion career so far -- and he doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon.\n\nHowever, despite the money, and despite the moniker, for Cruise it's all about the craft.\n\n\"It's not about being a movie star,\" he insisted. \"It's about being an actor and concentrating on that and finding roles that are going to be a challenge for me... Movie stardom can come and go, but your craft within, you can work forever if you keep working hard at that.\"\n\nRELATED CONTENT:"

        "text": "Hayley Atwell is a veteran of the West End, the British television industry, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But it wasn’t until she was cast in this summer’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One that the 41-year-old British actor was tasked with her greatest challenge yet: keeping up with Tom Cruise. Before she embarked on a global press tour to promote the summer’s most anticipated blockbuster, Atwell got on a call with her friend, the actor James D’Arcy, to talk about preparing for the physically demanding role, why making the movie was the ultimate film school, and the secret behind Tom Cruise’s maniacal running.\n\n———\n\nHAYLEY ATWELL: You look so sophisticated with your wall of books, your culture and your intelligence behind you.\n\nJAMES D’ARCY: They’re not actually books, it’s all made out of wood.\n\nATWELL: It’s a front.\n\nD’ARCY: It’s just a front, like the rest of my life. So this afternoon, I’m playing the role of a hard-boiled journalist. I won’t be taking no for an answer and there’ll be no skimping round the edges with your answers.\n\nATWELL: I’m ready. My phone’s off.\n\nD’ARCY: You go the extra mile. Speaking of which, how many miles have you gone today in preparation for the stunts that you do in Mission: Impossible?\n\nATWELL: Good question. Currently, I’m running about 30K a week. I did a 5K run this morning and then some Pilates mobility strength training.\n\nD’ARCY: I saw that on Instagram. It looks ridiculous.\n\nATWELL: Some people thought it looked like a medieval torture contraption.\n\nJAMES D’ARCY: It does.\n\nATWELL: But yes, I’ve done my 5K today, I’ve done my Pilates with Sam Eastwood, and what I’ve loved about working with her is that all the training I did had to do with creating physical behaviors that could then be incorporated in any kind of fight sequence or drifting-in-a-car sequence. It wasn’t that we were chasing a particular aesthetic for Grace, my character—it was getting to me to a point where I could be dynamic enough and safe enough to try a ton of different things and see what looked most effective and exciting for the audience.\n\nD’ARCY: Did you say to Sam and all the other stunt people when you started, “Look, obviously I don’t want to get injured, I want to do as many stunts as I possibly can myself, but mainly what I want to do is run faster than Tom”?\n\nATWELL: Well, bearing in mind I’m in high heels and I’m also handcuffed to him, just being able to not fall flat on my face was the initial goal.\n\nD’ARCY: Does he run as fast in real life as it looks like he runs when you watch the movies?\n\nATWELL: Yes, but what I’ve noticed on set is it’s not his speed that’s the most impressive. He’s studied the form, he’s studied how to run. So when he’s running, it feels like it’s with every cell in his body, as if he’s running towards the thing he wants to save and also running away from a bear. There’s not a lazy foot or a turned in knee at any point, and it creates this form that’s really beautiful to watch because it’s anatomically correct. It’s kind of amazing because you think some people might be faster than him, but he runs with such an urgency where you feel it.\n\nD’ARCY: Is that what he said to you? “Just so you know, when I’m running, I’m always imagining a bear.”\n\nATWELL: I imagine he’s probably running away from journalists.\n\nD’ARCY: Journalists like me, hard-boiled.\n\nATWELL: At one point I was running in the park and Sam said, “Well, they’ve now decided that they’ll have you running beside him,” and I went, “What? On roller skates? How the hell am I going to do that?” But then when they said, “You’ll be in high heels and you’re handcuffed,” I was like, “Okay. Well, I don’t have to catch up with him then. I just have to try and match his energy.” And he’s very safe, so he’s always making sure that I’m not going to fall flat on my face behind him. There’s a train sequence, and it begins with the train carriage vertical and we are standing on one end of it. It takes six seconds for this real-sized train carriage to go to horizontal to vertical, so on “action,” we would have to run up a very steep incline just in time to hold onto a bar, where we’d be suspended with a ravine below us. And we did it about six times, and I was puffing and panting, and they said, “We’re going to go again.” And so we went back down and Tom looked at me, and I could see in his eyes that obviously what he was looking back at was someone who’s probably in a bit of a frazzled state. And he was like, “You okay?” And I just remember going, “I don’t know. I don’t even know what I don’t know.” And he said, “I think you may have adrenal fatigue,” and I was like, “Okay.” And then he went, “Do you want some chocolate?”\n\nD’ARCY: He produced some from his back pocket.\n\nATWELL: Within about 30 seconds, a beautiful box of raw dark chocolate arrived on set and I wolfed it down, and then we went again and I was faster, sharper, with a smile on my face.\n\nD’ARCY: In Master and Commander, I had to climb to the top of the ship, and of course because you’re on a ship, it’s a pendulum. At the top, it feels very windy. And the other person up there with me was Russell Crowe, who was exemplary, like Tom, in terms of making sure that I was safe and okay. We were harnessed up, and he looked at me and went, “James, can you see my harness?” I sort of looked down and went, “Well, yeah, but they’ll paint that out.” And he went, “No, it’s not good, mate. Take it off me,” because he couldn’t take his own harness off. And I was like, “What?” He said, “Take the harness off me.” So I’m taking his harness off at the top of this ship and I’m, by the way, harnessed in twice. He refused to climb it with a harness, so then he clipped in when he got there, was unable to take it off himself, and insisted that I took his harness off. And as I was doing it, I was thinking, if Russell falls off and dies, am I an accomplice in his death? Anyway, he didn’t.\n\nATWELL: It’s like when I had my harness put on, you’ve got to pull your pants down in the middle of a set. You’ve obviously got your long johns on underneath, but it sort of feels a bit like your mum’s changing your nappy while you’re standing there. It’s a very humbling experience.\n\nD’ARCY: It is a weird thing, isn’t it? Because there’s some part of you that thinks glamor, glamor, glamor. And yes, there is a bit of glamor, but so often you are standing there in your pants next to Tom Cruise having your harness adjusted thinking, “I just want the earth to open up and eat me.”\n\nATWELL: I think being on a film set, you have to leave your ego at the door because the things you end up doing are things that probably only your family has seen you do, and you have to create this trust where you can be dripped on by someone else’s sweat, from the person that you’ve only met a few weeks before, and it gets you’re in the trenches with them quite quickly.\n\nD’ARCY: Or you walk onto the set to do the kissing scene and your kissing partner shows up, and they go, “I’m really sorry, I’ve got a terrible cold,” this is pre-COVID, and you’re like, “Okay,” because there’s no way around it.\n\nATWELL: That was the other extra challenge, COVID. The protocols were so strict.\n\nD’ARCY: You basically couldn’t see anybody or go anywhere. You were ferried to the set and back from the set, and then you were in a hotel room.\n\nATWELL: Yeah. At one point Tom was doing his own hair and makeup in Venice, so he would be like, “Is it okay? Do I need powder?”\n\nD’ARCY: That’s amazing. That film was such a big deal for the industry when you were shooting it because it was possibly the most visible film being shot over COVID, and obviously employed hundreds of people around the globe. I remember just from talking to you, but also I think it was in the press that McQ and Tom were absolutely determined that you guys were going to show the industry that it was possible to keep shooting through these difficult times.\n\nATWELL: Yeah, absolutely. It wasn’t just our film, but Tom would be on the phone to studios, other productions, sharing how they problem-solved and worked around it to keep an ongoing working environment so that, like you said, hundreds of people can retain their jobs and it can have a feeling of momentum within very strict safety regulations. And because we’d never seen anything like this before, you had to make up what those things were. There wasn’t the textbook of when there is a pandemic, this is how you do a film of this size. And even things like when we worked in Norway, we all lived on a boat so that we weren’t in town disrupting anyone’s lockdown life. It was like we were this traveling circus in our own isolated bubble, and we knew also that all eyes were on us because of Tom’s brand and the size of this franchise.\n\nD’ARCY: I’m going to switch gears a because I know you as a goof. When we worked together on Agent Carter, I always felt like you were quietly thinking about ways to, in the nicest possible way, trip me up, whether that be scaring me at lunchtime or on Halloween. So what I want to know is how long did you have to hide in Tom’s trailer on Halloween in order to scare him, and how did you get in there?\n\nATWELL: I couldn’t penetrate the compound, so I just picked on Simon Pegg instead.\n\nD’ARCY: It was literally Mission: Impossible.\n\nATWELL: It was. But with pranks, it’s important to state I don’t like cruelty or anything that is mean. You have to test the waters to see if this is something someone will actually enjoy, and once that permission is granted, then it’s fair game.\n\nD’ARCY: Did you prank Tom? And when he gave you his famous Christmas cake, which I know he did because you gave me a slice of it, did you give him a bit of the Hayley Atwell famous Christmas cake?\n\nATWELL: What’s that?\n\nD’ARCY: It doesn’t exist.\n\nATWELL: Well, he doesn’t eat sugar.\n\nD’ARCY: On a big film like Mission, how much room is there for playfulness, creativity, and permission to fail?\n\nATWELL: Great question. In the screen test, both McQ and Tom said, “Look, we haven’t got a script and we don’t have a character written, so we don’t know what we’re looking for until we find it, but we want to find the actress we want to work with, and then we will together in real time throughout the course of filming write that character based on what you give us.” Some people might find that terrifying, like, “Does that mean I’m auditioning all the time?” But because they’re such gentlemen and you feel that they’re on your side, you can’t fail because there is that safety net of knowing they’re only going to use the things at work. Tom would never say something was good or bad, it would just be different choices, offering up different things. And because they’re so transparent with their process, Tom might do something and be like, “I didn’t like that, it didn’t work,” or he’d watch playback and go, “I thought it was going to read in one way, but what I’m not feeling is this beat that we’re missing. Let me try something completely different.” And because he didn’t bring his ego to the set and neither did McQ, they’re working it out as they go along, very much trying to have an objective beginner’s eyes on it all the time.\n\nD’ARCY: That’s what I wanted to ask you next. You said that Tom would watch playback and then say, “That’s not quite reading the way I thought it would. Let me try something else.” But of course, he’s Tom Cruise. Did they afford you the same freedom?\n\nATWELL: Uniquely, it was the latter. And because that was happening quite early on, it meant that I built up more and more confidence to try and look at my own work objectively. There was one scene, it was a bit of a monologue and the camera was right in front of me, and my character is quite tired and vulnerable. I did it a number of times, and McQ and Tom were there, and we looked back on playback, and for me it wasn’t working. Maybe 10 years ago I would’ve been like, “I’m not good enough. It’s me.” But this time it was like, “I don’t know how to make this work, let’s look at it technically.” And McQ just went, “I think the camera’s in the wrong place because we have a camera that’s right in front of you. It’s a kind of confrontation with the audience because the audience is looking directly at you.” But if the camera was moved slightly above and to my side, two things are happening. With the camera moving high, it creates a sense of pressure over the character who in the frame is looking smaller, so that instantly makes her appear more vulnerable without me having to do anything. Secondly, with it slightly more to the side, the audience is with me and they’re starting to see the rest of the room the way that my character is seeing the room. So their visual is relating to my character’s perspective rather than me trying to be interrogated by the audience and make them feel a particular thing for her. It was a revelation to me.\n\nD’ARCY: What a film school for you. So often as actors, you arrive on set and the camera is where it is and you do the scene, but nobody says to you, “This is the reason we’re putting the camera here.”\n\nATWELL: I’ve been used to working more with directors who will come in and we’ll talk about the psychology or the inner-world of the character. That can be really useful, but also that feels more like that’s my internal job, to bring a rich inner world and naturalism and an understanding of what my character wants in that moment, what the obstacle is, and playing with those. And you’re right, they like the communication of explaining what’s being picked up on the lens.\n\nD’ARCY: It’s 50 percent of filmmaking. Of course you have to find the emotion and you have to be authentic, but the camera can do so much for you.\n\nATWELL: Understanding the camera, understanding what the lenses do, understanding what the composition of the frame is doing and what that’s communicating. And for me, that’s the work as a film actor to know. It’s developing a relationship with the DP so that I know what the camera’s picking up. There’s shots where I’m running across a moving train and I can feel the camera that’s on a crane that’s trying to move at the same speed as the train, so I’m sensing when it’s turning to get me in profile and therefore, how long I have to keep in frame for that shot before I go out of it. And that is everything. It’s knowing that the camera is your friend, and there’s no point having this incredible, deeply moving, beautiful performance if the camera’s way over there and you can’t see any of it.\n\nD’ARCY: It’s a dance, isn’t it?\n\nATWELL: It’s a dance, exactly."

        "text": "Nine Network journalist Peter Overton has come out in defence of Tom Cruise, hailing both his skills as an actors and his role in reviving cinema.\n\nThe endorsement of the Hollywood icon comes after rumours that Cruise and his team banned Overton from attending the “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” premiere in Sydney last week and from interviewing Cruise on the red carpet.\n\nThe feud reportedly stems from a 2005 “60 Minutes” interview between the two, in which tensions flare over Overton’s line of questioning about Cruise’s split from Nicole Kidman and how the two will continue to communicate and care for their children.\n\nDuring the interview, which occasionally resurfaces in the tabloids and social media, Cruise told Overton he was “stepping over the line” and implored him to “take responsibility” for his line of questioning. He also told Overton to “put your manners back in”.\n\nOverton was absent from the film’s premiere this year, which was attended by many other news anchors, entertainment reporters and media identities. His absense has given rise to a rumour that he was ‘banned’ from attending due to his conduct in 2005.\n\nOverton has now spoken about the rumours and conceded that he was not invited.\n\n“I wouldn’t have a clue,” he told Nova Sydney’s breakfast radio program “Fitzy and Wippa with Kate Ritchie” when asked if he was banned from the event. “No, we didn’t get an invite, but I also had another thing to do – the 6 o’clock news,” he said, in reference to his role as anchor of Nine’s nightly news bulletin.\n\nOverton conceded that he hadn’t spoken to Cruise in the 18 years since the interview, but said he continued to admire his work and what he had achieved for cinema from a distance.\n\n“Every now and then [the interview] pops up, but you know, I’ve always said, I like Tom. I think it’s amazing what he’s done with “Top Gun: Maverick“. I’ve seen that a couple of times. “Mission Impossible”, I can’t wait to see.\n\n“And the bottom line is, he’s a great actor, what he’s done for Hollywood in a really tough period with COVID and so on, is he has put the big-screen movies back in the cinema in a huge way, and we’re all going to see them.”\n\nOverton told the trio he would definitely be attending the “Mission Impossible” film and thought Cruise was fantastic to still be doing his own stunts and creating the kind of cinema he is today.\n\nThe film’s writer and director Christopher McQuarrie has been similarly impassioned about Cruise’s role in saving big cinema.\n\n“The person I want to compliment is the person who will always dodge the compliments. It’s this man, Mr. Tom Cruise. When this whole process started four years ago, we were entering a period where it looked like this event was headed for extinction. It was a very real possibility that this medium that we loved so much was on its way out. One person said, ‘No, we’re gonna keep it going’. And that’s this man right here,” McQuarrie said.\n\nWhen approached by Variety Australia, Nine denied its star presenter was banned from the premiere. Paramount Pictures, the distributor of the film, did not respond to a request for comment."

        "text": "Tom Cruise may be a worldwide movie star, but he’s also “just a guy,\" according to his Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One collaborators.\n\nDespite his enduring fame, Simon Pegg, Hayley Atwell and director Chris McQuarrie insist that the actor, 61, is just a man who loves making movies.\n\nPegg, 53, who plays Benji Dunn in the iconic spy series, told The Times that Cruise is involved “in every part of a film” — from filling its lead role to helping out on-set caterers. “I just don’t think anybody else can be as arsed as he can,” he told the outlet.\n\nThe star, who met the Jerry Maguire actor nearly two decades ago, cited the actor’s tendency to do his own stunts while describing his intense dedication to the movies he creates.\n\n“With special effects, you know something is artificial — it removes a degree of tension — so Tom pushes things to the limit, to the point of risking his life,” Pegg said of Cruise.\n\n\n\nHayley Atwell and Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One. Paramount Pictures/Skydance\n\nAtwell, 41, seconded Pegg’s claims of Cruise’s dedication to making movies that audiences will love.\n\n\"It’s very rare,\" she told The Times of the Risky Business star’s attention to detail on set, recalling when he gave a runner-slash-aspiring-cinematographer a laminated cinematography guide.\n\nThe actress, who plays Grace in the action film, added that — similar to his treatment of everyone on a film set — Cruise values viewers and their experience with a movie above all else.\n\n“He doesn’t want to make movies now to punish an audience,” Atwell told the publication. “He doesn’t want films with the message that if you do not understand this, you’re not smart.”\n\nTom Cruise, Hayley Atwell and Christopher McQuarrie share the love at the premiere of Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One in Seoul. Han Myung-Gu/Getty Images for Paramount pictures\n\nThe Marvel star continued, “I can tell when I watch some movies that the director has made it for themselves. I don’t feel involved or I think, ‘Am I stupid?’ Tom’s not a snob.”\n\nAn example of this, Atwell said, was during a script read for a Mission: Impossible film — not Dead Reckoning Part One — when Cruise told the crew that he “didn’t get” a line, which translated to “the audience will not get it” — and thus it was cut.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nMcQuarrie, 54, the director of several Mission: Impossible movies and a longtime friend of Cruise, echoed Pegg and Atwell’s statements about Cruise’s desire to make movies that are fun for audiences.\n\n“There is an outsized importance placed on Oscars [and] films that not many people are going to see,” he told The Times, noting that it is a phenomenon that he says is a “wedge has been driven into the [film] industry.”\n\n\n\n“Are you an artist or an entertainer?” McQuarrie posed, before adding that Cruise — who introduced himself to McQuarrie as a maker of “mass entertainment” in 2006 — does not see these titles as “mutually exclusive.”\n\nThe cast of Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One in Rome. TIZIANA FABI/AFP via Getty\n\nPegg also raved to the publication about Tom’s intense love of movies — the intersection of art and entertainment — and what it means for the future of film.\n\n“People can argue that cinema is frivolous, but it’s not,” he told The Times. “Cinema brings people together at a time we’re pulling apart, and that just added to Tom’s determination to put people in a room together.”\n\nHe continued, “The power of cinema is, for him, precious and it’s vital we sustain it.”\n\nThe Shaun of the Dead actor also opened up about his personal relationship with Cruise, telling the outlet that he was able to “hack my way through all the bizarre mythology” surrounding the Top Gun star.\n\n“On one side he’s Tom Cruise — this enigmatic film star everyone wants to know about — and on the other he’s just a guy,” Pegg said. “I like being normal with him.”"

I mean, everything we do... In terms of this movie, definitely the motorcycle jump. But we have continued and we've pushed ourselves even further in Part Two, and you'll see. It's terrifying.\"\n\nFor those unfamiliar and not worried about stunt spoilers, the motorcycle jump, which you can watch the making of below, sees Cruise actually riding a motorcycle off an extremely tall cliff in Norway before jumping off it and deploying a parachute. Oh, and Cruise did say back in 2021 that this was the most dangerous thing he's ever done.\n\nLoading Play\n\nWhile McQuarrie wasn't ready to reveal any more about this \"terrifying\" stunt, he did talk with us a bit further at the film's red carpet premiere about stunts in general, if they scare him anymore, and how one gets the green light.\n\n\"Oh, they all do,\" McQuarrie said of these stunts. \"They're all terrible ideas. We have a motto on this movie now: 'This is a terrible idea - when do we start?' It never starts with awesome. It starts with, 'That's very ill-advised.' That's how you know you're on to something.\"\n\nCan't wait to see those terrible ideas in IMAX. #MissionImpossible pic.twitter.com/Wcw9U1p6CV — IGN (@IGN) June 24, 2023\n\nSpeaking of ill-advised, Cruise himself understands the risks these stunts bring with them and even said he wanted to perform the motorcycle jump stunt on day one just in case it killed him.\n\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One will be released in theaters on July 12, 2023, and Part Two will follow on June 28, 2024.

AFP via Getty Images\n\nAnd “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” starring 80-year-old Harrison Ford, is projected to open this weekend to just $60 million domestically — $40 million less than 2008’s “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.”\n\nThe movie industry is trapped in an existential “Temple of Doom.” Disney execs staring at these numbers probably look like the guy in “Raiders of the Lost Ark” when his face melts off.\n\nThe only bright spot so far this summer has been Sony’s animated “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” with $560 million worldwide.\n\n4 Disney execs are surely feeling the heat from the poor box office projections for the upcoming “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.” (“Raiders of the Lost Ark” pictured above.) Movieclips/YouTube\n\nOnly one man can save struggling movie theater chains. Again.\n\nAs if summoned by a desperate prayer, Tom Cruise will parachute in on July 12 with Paramount’s “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.”\n\nThe film is expected to open domestically to about $90 million over five days — setting a possible record for the seven-film franchise — and heaps more internationally.\n\nIf I were Cruise, I’d be jumping up and down on Oprah’s couch. Because I would know full well that I am the only reliably bankable movie star left.\n\n4 Cruise’s “Top Gun: Maverick” earned a whopping $1.49 billion at the worldwide box office. ©Paramount/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nIt’s not an exaggeration to say that in May 2022 as theaters were hobbling along, Cruise and his (sometimes irate) efforts to finish and release “Top Gun: Maverick” rescued cinemas around the world that had been sitting empty.\n\n“Maverick” was a sequel to a 36-year-old movie that millennials and Gen Z-ers who regularly flock to Marvel films couldn’t care less about. Older fans of the heartthrob-filled original had no clue if it would be any good.\n\nBut the action movie opened the Cannes Film Festival, received euphoric reviews and ultimately grossed $1.49 billion worldwide.\n\nHarking back to the monolithic cultural moment of “Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens,” seemingly everybody saw “Maverick.”\n\n4 Cruise has become well-known for doing his own stunts in the “Mission Impossible” films. YouTube\n\nYou see, what 60-year-old Cruise has managed in this phase of his career, quite brilliantly, is to become synonymous with Entertainment.\n\nNot prestige, not awards, not sexiness nor hilarity — a Cruise movie simply means a fantastic time had by all.\n\nFive years ago, I gave “Mission: Impossible — Fallout” four stars and called the franchise “the best ongoing action series out there.”\n\nIts consistent sky-high quality is, in large part, because of Cruise’s well-known insistence on doing his own stunts. His overachieving attitude makes his thrill-ride movies more tactile and real than anything else in the genre.\n\nMarvel films, especially the woeful “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” feel increasingly like a 2.5-hour green screen exercise that audiences struggle to connect with.\n\nIn “Dial of Destiny,” a very obviously CGI Ford runs on top of a moving train. The sequence is alarmingly fake and hard to believe.\n\nThat Cruise regularly puts himself in harm’s way for the sake of a scene has become well-known to average moviegoers.\n\nPlus he does it with nuclear charm and unrelenting intensity, and we feel going in that he has worked extraordinarily hard for our money.\n\nI suspect that in three weeks Cruise and Paramount will make a ton of it."

Then, Cruise took the opportunity to express his admiration for Greece.\n\n“Thank you for being here. I love Greece. Great food, great people,” he told the reporter before telling him what makes this movie stand out compared to its predecessors.\n\n“This is bigger, this is luxurious. It’s a massive, epic adventure. It’s a part 1 and a part 2 because the story and scale of the film is so big. I make my movies for the theatres, for the big screen, and this is just off the charts,” Cruise said.\n\nHis co-stars Simon Pegg, Hayley Atwell, Rebecca Ferguson and Vanessa Kirby joined him on the red carpet.\n\nCritics’ reviews of the film will be published on 5 July, before the film’s release on the 14th.\n\nCruise said the two-part film marked the “culmination of all my skills” and promised even those unfamiliar with the series would have an “epic adventure”.\n\nMission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One sees him reprise his role of Ethan Hunt, as the Impossible Mission Force (IMF) set out to track down a terrifying new weapon that threatens humanity.\n\nThe film was shot partly in the UK and features the usual death-defying stunts, including one in which Cruise jumps off a cliff on a motorcycle.\n\nSpeaking at the film’s London premiere, he said that even as a child he had always wanted to make movies, and had devoted himself to taking on new challenges and learning new skills.\n\n“Since I was a little kid, that’s what I did,” the 60-year-old told the PA news agency.\n\n“When I was three or four years old I was jumping off my roof and climbing trees – I wanted to make movies, I wanted adventure, I wanted to travel the world.\n\n“So that’s what I do, I train – I really enjoy taking on different skills, to work to become competent in everything that I do.”\n\nHe continued: “It was actually years of training… because I fly jets, I fly helicopters, I fly aeroplanes. I’m a skydiver, I’m a parachuter, race cars, motorcycles.\n\n“[This film] was a culmination of all my skills…. There’s a lot going on there’s a lot happening… [but] the most important part is getting the shot and getting the story across.”\n\nThe process of shooting the film was hampered by Covid-19 lockdowns, with an audio recording of Cruise shouting at production staff for apparently flaunting guidelines leaked in December 2020.\n\n“In 2020 there was a lot going on that was a huge challenge just trying to figure out how to make a film in those circumstances,” he told PA.\n\n“We kind of wrote the rulebook on how to do it and it was an extraordinary experience just sort of getting through – it made the shoot a little longer, but I think it’s made the film better.”\n\nEvery Mission: Impossible film in the franchise to date has made at least $100m at the worldwide box office.\n\nThe most successful so far is the sixth instalment, Mission: Impossible – Fallout, which took $220m, although the early films were released at the turn of the millennium and their box office takings are not adjusted for inflation.\n\nCruise’s other film credits include Oblivion, Vanilla Sky, Collateral, Jerry Maguire, Top Gun and its sequel Top Gun: Maverick.\n\nREAD MORE: Christian Bale vacations in Mykonos with his family – See phots and videos."

        "text": "Hollywood actor and producer Tom Cruise expressed his love for Greece and Greek culture during a recent interview at the premiere of his new movie in London last week.\n\nCruise, who is famous for performing his own stunts, is currently promoting his latest film, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, the seventh installment in the highly successful Mission: Impossible series.\n\nThe actor and producer’s last film to hit the silver screen, Top Gun: Maverick broke several records and became the sixth-highest-grossing movie in US domestic box office history, having collected $683 million in North America.\n\nTom Cruise praises Greece in recent interview\n\nThe Hollywood actor was talking to the press at the London premiere of the latest Mission: Impossible movie when one of the reporters informed him that he was from Greece.\n\n“How are you? Nice to meet you too. Thank you for being here,” Cruise politely replied before adding, “I love Greece. Great food, great people.”\n\nWhen asked about the movie itself, Cruise explained “This is the biggest and most luxurious. It’s a huge, epic adventure that’s split into two parts.”\n\n“The scope of the film is very wide. I make my films for the big screen only. This film is unprecedented,” the actor added.\n\nMission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One\n\nAccording to the synopsis of the latest movie, “Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team embark on their most dangerous mission yet: To track down a terrifying new weapon that threatens all of humanity before it falls into the wrong hands.”\n\n“With control of the future and the fate of the world at stake, and dark forces from Ethan’s past closing in, a deadly race around the globe begins,” the film’s description continues. “Confronted by a mysterious, all-powerful enemy, Ethan is forced to consider that nothing can matter more than his mission – not even the lives of those he cares about most.”\n\nThe trailer gives a taste of all the action set pieces and daring stunts fans of the Mission: Impossible series have come to expect. Late last year, Cruise shared a behind-the-scenes clip of one of the stunts for the movie where he rode off of the top of a cliff on a motorbike before performing a base jump.\n\nSo excited to share what we’ve been working on. #MissionImpossible pic.twitter.com/rIyiLzQdMG — Tom Cruise (@TomCruise) December 19, 2022\n\n“This is far and away the most dangerous thing we’ve ever attempted,” the 60-year-old actor said at the time.\n\nThe stunt coordinator for the film, Wade Eastwood, explained that Cruise had to study and train to perfect his skills. He spent “a year of base training, advanced sky-dive training, a lot of canopy skills, a lot of tracking.”\n\nTom’s coach Miles Daisher described the star as an “amazing individual” and praised him for his dedication in doing his own stunts. “You tell him something, and he just locks it in,” he said, talking about “his sense of spatial awareness” and adding that “he is the most aware person [he has] ever met.”"

Text over the screen reads “The Moment Vs The Photo,” as the actor familiarizes himself with the camera’s settings.\n\nThe 60-year-old actor and producer then crouches down to capture the three women posing in their gowns on a stage above the event's red carpet.\n\nDetermined to get the right angle, Cruise leans down to his right to ensure he's nailed the perfect shot. An image of the photograph then appears in the clip.\n\n“How does it look,” a voice asks Cruise as he walks away.\n\n“Good,” the actor replies with a smile.\n\nTom Cruise in South Korea. Shutterstock\n\nIt's been a week of championing fellow stars for Cruise, who took a break from his action-packed schedule promoting his latest Mission Impossible movie — which is released in theaters next month — to tweet about some summer movies he's looking forward to watching himself.\n\n“This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters,” the actor wrote on Wednesday, alongside photos of himself and his Dead Reckoning director Christopher McQuarrie in front of each of the films' respective posters.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up to date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nAmong the films he praised were Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the long-awaited sequel starring Harrison Ford as the legendary adventurer (out Friday), the atomic-bomb biographical thriller Oppenheimer starring Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer and Barbie with Margot Robbie. The latter two films will be released on the same day: July 21.\n\n\"Congratulations, Harrison Ford, on 40 years of Indy and one of the most iconic characters in history,\" added Cruise. \"I love a double feature, and it doesn't get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Oppenheimer and Barbie.”\n\nPom Klementieff, Hayley Atwell and Vanessa Kirby in South Korea. Alamy\n\nCruise also recently praised how people of different cultures \"join together to enjoy cinema\" at the Dead Reckoning in Rome.\n\n\"It’s something that I grew up with, that made me and inspired me to dream and want to travel the world,\" Cruise said, reported Variety. “My goal since I was little was to make movies and travel. And not just be a tourist, but work in that world and understand their culture.\"\n\n\"Through my movies, I’ve been able to have that because everyone here has allowed me to entertain them. It’s a privilege that I have never taken for granted,\" he continued in his speech, highlighting the importance of seeing movies in theaters. \"It’s my passion to entertain you, and I will always fight for big theaters and that kind of experience for everyone.”\n\n"

        "text": "Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise argued all the time during the making of Mission Impossible – Dead Reckoning — about how to keep you, the viewer, entertained for every second of the film.\n\n“I get asked all the time, ‘Do you and Tom ever argue?’ Yes, we argue every single day on your behalf. It’s not about my vision or Tom’s vision. It’s about your experience,” McQuarrie told MovieMaker.\n\nMcQuarrie has directed two previous films in the series, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation and Mission: Impossible – Fallout, and his stunning track record with Cruise goes back to 2008’s Valkyrie, which McQuarrie co-wrote. He first directed Cruise in 2012’s Jack Reacher.\n\nJoining the fast-moving Mission: Impossible franchise nearly a decade ago meant trying to keep up a goal of making every movie outdo the last. Loud, gorgeous, and heartfelt, their films are like the grandest of operas with the finest musicians performing. Sometimes they get close to the stratosphere — as in the HALO jump for Fallout.\n\nBut for an especially thrilling scene in Dead Reckoning, they imposed a limitation (and some mild spoilers follow): putting Cruise behind the wheel of a tiny Fiat for a race through Rome.\n\n“You lose all sense of time because you’re going so fast. It’s so dangerous,” McQuarrie told MovieMaker. “Filming car chases is very chaotic. We were in Rome for a little over two weeks, with only three or four hours to film at some locations.”\n\nHere’s our Q&A with McQuarrie about how research begets more research, how a little Zed camera can create a depth of perception, and the perils of chasing a stone downhill.\n\nSonya Alexander: How do you prepare the visual language for a film like Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One?\n\nChristopher McQuarrie: We were very determined to make a very different film from the previous Mission Impossibles. We want to keep the notion alive that these films evolve visually, from the first film all the way through to the present. A lot of that was looking back on it. Looking at what had worked. Looking at what we could improve upon.\n\nI worked with cinematographer Frasar Taggart, our gaffer Martin Smith who does all of our lighting, and Jonathan “Chunky” Richmond, my first assistant camera operator… We were a little bit of a brain trust in constantly finding ways to keep the camera moving and keep the scenes alive. And always creating a little sense of instability in the story because of the chaos in the narrative.\n\nChristopher McQuarrie on Shooting the Fiat Chase\n\nSonya Alexander: Do you have any particular cameras you like to use for action sequences, like the Fiat chase?\n\nChristopher McQuarrie: It’s less about the cameras and more about the lenses. In this particular sequence, for the chase in Rome, we used what was called a Zed cam. It is a very small, very flexible, very versatile camera. And larger cameras simply wouldn’t have worked because the Fiat itself is simply so small.\n\nTom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie on the set of Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning – Part One from Paramount Pictures and Skydance.\n\nWe tried putting a full-sized camera on it and it was bigger than the car itself. I don’t know if you remember The Flintstones, when they put the food tray on the car… that’s literally what it looked like when you put cameras on it. You couldn’t see through the windshield.\n\nAnd that’s how we make these movies. The action dictates the kind of camera that we’re working with. We explore every medium. What it comes right down to is what camera can get the job done and in many cases what camera can survive.\n\nSonya Alexander: What was the biggest challenge of doing the submarine scene?\n\nChristopher McQuarrie: The biggest challenge of the submarine scene was that a lot of what you are seeing is inside a space with no windows. There’s no way to see outside. There’s no way to create a three-dimensional geography. You don’t really know where the submarine is in three- dimension space. All of our action sequences are about geography.\n\nIt was about creating the instruments inside the submarine to get a sense of how the submariners felt the world around them and understood 3D space. And all of that blocking is meant to put you in a submarine the way the crew would be there and creating that sense of spatial awareness.\n\nThe other thing is it’s just a very cramped environment, built on a gimbal. The set could roll twenty degrees in all directions. It was very challenging. It was a very tight space. A lot of those actors weren’t terribly experienced. In fact, one of the actors, it was his first time on camera. They were extraordinary. Over the course of shooting that scene, they really became the crew.\n\nWhose idea was this again? pic.twitter.com/PuRM82rzsp — Tom Cruise (@TomCruise) July 7, 2023\n\nA ‘Little Spoiler’ About Mission Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part 2\n\nSonya Alexander: When you do the research for these films, do you come across info that inspires future storylines?\n\nChristopher McQuarrie: Yes, absolutely. The submarine was a really good example of one. The research we were doing for that particular sequence inspired what’s going to happen with the rest of the story, particularly as it relates to submarines. There’s a little spoiler for you.\n\nSonya Alexander: What is the greatest strength of this film compared to the others?\n\nChristopher McQuarrie: I think that every film that Tom and I do takes all of the knowledge that we’ve acquired from the previous films, and we apply it to that film. So, you’re watching a film that’s benefitting from all the previous Mission Impossibles, Edge of Tomorrow, Top Gun: Maverick.\n\nEverything we’ve learned, we’ve applied it here and we never stop. We never believe that we know everything. We’re constantly confronting each other, confronting the narrative, and we’re always trying to learn. We never get too comfortable to think that we’ve got it all figured out. When you think you know what you’re doing, that’s when you get surprised.\n\nAlso Read: Who Is the Enemy in Top Gun: Maverick?\n\nChristopher McQuarrie on Arguing With Tom Cruise\n\nSonya Alexander: You’ve collaborated with Tom a lot. What do you enjoy most about your collaborations?\n\nChristopher McQuarrie: There’s no ego. There is no particular set of rules other than you’ve got to entertain the audience. We need to engage the audience every single instant of the movie. In a strange way, the audience is there with us in every story meeting, in every test screening, in the editing room, on the set.\n\nYou’re making the movie with us because we’re constantly thinking about what your experience is going to be. And it makes it a very democratic process. It’s not really about who’s right and who’s wrong. It’s all about what’s right for the audience. That allows us to eliminate conflict.\n\nIf he has an idea that I don’t understand or I have an idea that he doesn’t understand, we just proceed and take it on its natural course and it either works or it doesn’t. But ultimately, it’s about whether or not you’re having a good time in the movie. I get asked all the time, “Do you and Tom ever argue?” Yes, we argue every single day on your behalf. It’s not about my vision or Tom’s vision. It’s about your experience.\n\nSonya Alexander: Since you’re the writer and director, what pressures do you feel to actualize the visuals and story from the page?\n\nChristopher McQuarrie: The way I like to describe it — writing is pushing a boulder up a mountain, directing is running down the mountain with the boulder after you. Everybody is waiting for you when you’re the screenwriter. They’re all waiting for those pages. It’s the blueprint for how the movie is made.\n\nIt’s a very lonely and solitary place to be. And when you’re directing, the clock starts. The firehose is on, and you have to drink from it. You’re responsible not only for the enormous budget of the film, but you’re also responsible for the safety of all of the people around you. It’s a lot to balance on the head of a pin.\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One arrives in theaters, including IMAX, on Wednesday.\n\nMain image: Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie on the set of Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One from Paramount Pictures and Skydance."

        "text": "In the dynamic tapestry of the 21st century, a transformative synergy between social media and the film industry has emerged as a game changer in the entertainment world. The digital epoch has unrolled a platform for blossoming talents, tethering them to a global stage. Amidst the newcomers, Greg 'Tarzan' Davis shines brightly, having catapulted from viral social media fame to the glamorous realms of Hollywood, sharing the spotlight with industry legend Tom Cruise in two blockbuster hits.\n\nUnleashing high-energy, comedic content, Davis shook up social media and swiftly seized the digital world's attention with his Instagram series Living With Jane.\n\nHollywood, recognizing the organic and extensive appeal of Davis, turned its gaze toward him. Producers and casting directors were captivated by his charismatic persona and athletic capabilities, earmarking him for action-packed roles. Before long, he shared the marquee with the legendary Tom Cruise in two films.\n\n“I got to see what Hollywood was like on a smaller scale of interacting with people entertained by your work,” Davis shared about his ascend from social media to Hollywood. “​​It has helped me understand how people react to you when they enjoy something you've done.”\n\nDavis' big breakthrough arrived in 2021 when he starred in eleven episodes of Grey’s Anatomy as Dr. Jordan Wright. Yet, it was his big screen debut in Tom Cruise’s 2022 blockbuster, Top Gun: Maverick, where audiences witnessed a new dimension of Davis, portraying the audacious pilot Lt. Javy 'Coyote' Machado.\n\nFew up-and-coming actors can claim they’ve starred in not just one but two Cruise movies. Davis now has those bragging rights. On July 12, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, already receiving a certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, is set to debut worldwide. This allows Davis to showcase his acting and stunt capabilities in what could potentially be this summer's blockbuster hit.\n\n“I think ever since I started working with Tom, my life has gotten a little bit crazier. I'm a pilot. Now I ride motorcycles, skydive down, bungee jump, and I do a lot of exciting things. And Tom is very infectious regarding doing this stuff,” Davis shared about his second stint with Cruise.\n\nIn this latest Mission: Impossible chapter, Davis brings to life Degas, one of the agents who pursues Ethan Hunt. Having worked twice with Cruise, Davis now regards him as a mentor and a friend. With Cruise's decades of experience, he's shared valuable guidance with Davis.\n\n“The biggest advice that he's ever given me is that whatever happens to you is because of you, whether good or bad; take control of your life because your decisions will shape the future. If something bad happens, you can correct it. And if something good happens, you can continue to produce the results that created something positive,” Davis revealed."

Just ask any of his Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One costars.\n\nIn fact, Simon Pegg, who has known Cruise since first working together in 2006's Mission: Impossible III, revealed that behind his movie star status, the 60-year-old is the most caring co-worker he's ever had.\n\n\"Of all the mist of stuff that's around him, in the center of that mist is a generous, sweet guy who looks after everybody,\" Pegg exclusive told E! News' Chief Correspondent Keltie Knight on the June 21 episode (airing tonight at 11 p.m. on E!). \"He leads from the top down. And he's kind of inspiring to be around. There's no one else like him, he's the last movie star of the old kind.\"\n\nPegg even revealed Cruise has been just as warm and friendly since the moment they were first introduced nearly two decades ago.\n\n\"When I first met him, it was my first time to Hollywood,\" he noted. \"He came to set the first day we met, he immediately made me feel very welcome, very at home, was incredibly generous.\"\n\nAs Pegg stressed, the Top Gun: Maverick star couldn't be grounded—despite his star power.\n\n\"Over the 17 years that we've been friends, I feel lucky to get to see a part of him that everyone else wants to see, which is just the guy,\" Pegg continued. \"And he is just a guy. He's an extraordinary guy. He's a guy who feels the obligation to the audience to risk his life for them to kind of entertain them.\""

        "text": "Until the 1980’s, Hollywood had a strange relationship with the Vietnam War. While the war was actually being fought, movies, typically, did not depict the war unless they were something like John Wayne’s The Green Berets. If the war was dealt with, usually it was done metaphorically, or by using another war as a stand-in, such as what happened with 1970’s MASH. This started to change after the war finally ended, with the late seventies seeing the release of three major films – The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now and Coming Home, Despite their popularity, during the first half of the eighties, when the war was dealt with on-screen it was typically as wish fulfillment, where action stars such as Chuck Norris and Sylvester Stallone single-handedly refought the war, and won, to the delight of audiences.\n\nThat all changed when Oliver Stone made Platoon. For the first time, a Vietnam War movie was made by someone who actually served. Stone was a U.S Army veteran who was twice wounded, and received a Bronze Star, a Purple Heart and many other decorations. For the first time, Platoon presented a realistic depiction of the war through the eyes of the grunts, and it led to a whole slew of Vietnam movies, including Full Metal Jacket, Hamburger Hill, Casualties of War, The Hanoi Hilton, and many others. Stone himself would return to the war in 1989’s Born on the Fourth of July, which would prove to be a defining film for it’s star – Tom Cruise.\n\nFlashback to 1988. Rain Man was a massive hit at the box office, ranking as the top grossing film of the year and winning a whole slew of Oscars. While Dustin Hoffman took home a Best Actor trophy, his co-star, Tom Cruise, wasn’t even nominated, and many thought he’d been overshadowed by Hoffman, who had the showier role.\n\nYet, by the time the Oscars rolled around Cruise was already in the middle of shooting a movie that would earn him his first Oscar nomination, Born on the Fourth of July. For Oliver Stone, it was a passion project. He’d long wanted to bring the true story of Ron Kovic to the big screen. Kovic was a U.S, Marine Corp Sergeant who was shot an paralyzed during the war. A paraplegic, upon his return home he became an outspoken anti-war activist, and his story resonated for Stone, who had actually been hired to adapt Kovic memoir in the seventies as a potential starring vehicle for Al Pacino. The project fell apart, and Kovic subsequently acted as a consultant for Coming Home, for which Jon Voight won an Oscar playing a paraplegic veteran heavily inspired by Kovic.\n\nIn the wake of Platoon, Stone was suddenly one of the most important directors in Hollywood, with his reputation only boosted by the success of Wall Street, which won its star Michael Douglas an Oscar. He decided that he wanted to return to the war by examining the anti-war movement, and indeed it would form the second part of his loose Vietnam trilogy, which would be concluded by Heaven & Earth, which would examine the conflict from the Vietnamese side.\n\nWorking with a heftier budget, Stone and his DP Robert Richardson would be shooting anamorphically for the first time, and they needed a real movie star to carry the movie. Stone could have had his pick of anyone, but his first and only choice was Tom Cruise. While this may seem like a no-brainer now, it was an unusual pairing at the time. Lets not forget that Top Gun had come out the same year as Platoon, and the two films could not have been more different in their treatment of the armed services. Stone even called Top Gun “fascist”, but he still wanted Cruise to play the part, mainly due to his Golden Boy reputation. Stone’s theory was that it would be fascinating to see what Cruise would be like were his presumably bright future stolen away from him in an instant, as happened with Kovic.\n\nIndeed, the fact that Cruise is so young and promising in the first act makes the movie all the more bittersweet. The first act of the movie plays out like your quintessential Tom Cruise movie, with him the Golden Boy pride of his family, who they proudly send off to war. He comes back, initially, a shell of his former self, but gradually is reawakened and in his own way, is victorious in the end, albeit his victory is bittersweet.\n\nIn Cruise, Stone found a willing participant. In fact, Cruise was so gung-ho in his portrait that, for awhile, him and Stone considered using a nerve agent to simulate paralysis, only for the insurance companies to forbid them. As Laurence Olivier told Dustin Hoffman when he stayed up for days on end to play sleep deprived in Marathon Man, “try acting.”\n\nCruise would spend a full year preparing for the role, and his physical transformation is a sight to behold, as outside of Tropic Thunder, Tom Cruise typically looks like – well, Tom Cruise. Here, with his moustache and receding hairline, Cruise disappears into the role, and indeed Kovic, who it should be noted is still alive and well, was so touched by his dedication that he gave Cruise his Bronze Star.\n\nStone would fill the rest of the cast with an interesting mix of actors, some of whom he’d worked with before. Perhaps the two most important supporting roles would be played by two carry-overs from Platoon, Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger. Each would play a variation on the roles they played in that film, once again playing the hero’s quasi-spiritual fathers. Dafoe would play a major supporting role as a fellow quadriplegic Kovic meets in Mexico, while Berenger would play a much smaller, but just as important part, as the Recruiting Officer for the Marine Corps, whose spiel leaves the impressionable Kovic desperate to enlist. It’s essentially a cameo, but it’s an important one. Other Platoon vets, including John C. McGinley and Mark Moses would show up in other roles, while actors Stone would work with again and again in the future, such as Frank Whalley and Tom Sizemore. One of the most important supporting roles would go to a young Kyra Sedgwick, who plays the girl Kovic left behind, who eventually becomes an anti-war activist and helps inspire his new take on the war.\n\nOverall, Born on the Fourth of July is a rich addition to the filmographies of both Cruise and Stone. For Cruise, it was a showcase role, and if anyone still doubted him in 1989, this movie would end any speculation that he was just a movie star, rather than a legitimately talented actor. Cruise is outstanding, and indeed it’s the type of role I think Cruise could still play nowadays, although for the time being his focus seems to be more on pushing the craft of the action film further and further. Still, if he decided to return to more character-based stuff, I think Cruise could shock people.\n\nFor Stone, it’s one of his best films as all the elements seem to come together perfectly here. At about 2.5 hours, it’s a disciplined, but still epic story, and it’s not quite as aggressive as his later work would be, with him never quite the same after Natural Born Killers. The editing was provocative for the era, but now it seems almost restrained, and Stone also benefits form having a great score by John Williams, which compliments the soundtrack selections perfectly. Stone actually only spends a brief amount of time in Vietnam here, as he’d previously covered that territory about as well as he could in Platoon, but Cruise still had to undergo in the infamously difficult Dale Dye training method, which would become a standard for Hollywood war movies for years to come. Arguably the most harrowing part of the film would be set at a VA hospital, where Kovic, in disbelief, tries to overcome his injury, only to be faced with squalid, over-packed hospitals that make similar sequences in movies like Forrest Gump look cartoonish in comparison. Stone also goes to great pains to depict the anti-war movement in a realistic way, even hiring Kovic and perhaps the most famous anti-war protestor of them all, Abbie Hoffman to advise, with the film climaxing with Kovic protesting the Republican National Convention. If the movie has any failing, it’s that Kovic’s anti-war activities get relatively little screen time, with Stone more interesting in Kovic’s physical and spiritual journey. One could almost argue that with Kovic still alive and well, the two could re-team on a second Kovic project, with him still an active anti-war demonstrator.\n\nIn the end, Born on the Fourth of July was a smash hit. While it didn’t come close to making the kind of money Rain Man or even Platoon did, it still made over $70 million in 1989 dollars, and was the 10th highest grossing movie of the year. Inevitably, Cruise lost the Oscar to Daniel Day Lewis for My Left Foot, but Stone won an Oscar for Best Director. All these years later, it remains somewhat unheralded as the movies of Cruise’s everyone remembers are his huge blockbusters, but to me, this contains his best ever performance and should be watched again and again."

        "text": "UPDATE SATURDAY AM: In the wake of the older-skewing, very expensive Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny stumbling at the box office with an $83.8M Friday-Tuesday domestic start, sources have called upon me to evaluate a similarly priced, older dude franchise sequel at around $300M. That’s this weekend’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, which, analyzed by the same measuring stick — particularly given the pic’s U.S./Canada 5-day of $78M — is well-below the $90M tracking Paramount was hoping for. Three-day here is $54.2M.\n\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge and Harrison Ford in ‘Indiana Jones and The Dial Of Destiny’ Everett Collection\n\nBut here is the root of the root, and the bud of the bud, and that is Dead Reckoning and Dial of Destiny are not the same. Already, in its running global take of $122.2M through yesterday, Dead Reckoning is on the verge of overtaking the $130M global start of Indy.\n\nIn fact, Dead Reckoning is bound to have the upper hand in the long-run, particularly on a global basis.\n\nYes, I just said that.\n\nDead Reckoning‘s demos are very similar to Dial of Destiny: 55+ was both their largest quad (Mission at 22%, Indy at 25%), Men over 25 are dominant in the turnout (respectively 46%, 43%), the prime moviegoing demo of 18-34 is just over a third for both (37%, 36%), and so on.\n\nHang on for one great weekend with Hayley Atwell and Tom Cruise in ‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One’ Paramount/Everett Collection\n\nHowever, the reviews and audiences exits on Dead Reckoning bury Dial of Destiny. In updated Friday night PostTrak exits, Dead Reckoning gets 5 stars and 90% from audiences (Indy only received 4 stars and 79%), with men/women at 62% / 38% grading it 90% / 89% (Indy‘s grades for both were 74% and 85%). Deal with it, Disney: The ball was dropped quality wise on Dial of Destiny, and the sequel is suffering with critics and fans. We expect more from Lucasfilm, especially on a legacy finale.\n\nGrosses went down between Indiana Jones movies, while grosses went up on Mission movies: Dead Reckoning could see a 5-day franchise record still, besting Mission: Imposible II’s $78.8M. The Cruise feature is still in its prime; keep reading.\n\nSaid one rival studio executive source this AM, “With these reviews and PostTrak numbers, I would expect this one to leg out through summer — these are strong numbers.”\n\nIf anything, the Tom Cruise sequel has all the mojo to not only outstrip Indy domestically, but the potential to make significantly more overseas — even if China doesn’t pull in a $100M+ gross like it did on Mission: Impossible – Fallout, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, and Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol.\n\nCruise’s previous three Mission movies generated over 70% of their global box office abroad. Indy is not going to do that. As we told you yesterday, the global outlook for Dead Reckoning is still around $240M; As of last weekend, Indy‘s global was slightly more domestic than foreign, 51% to 49%.\n\nBut wait a second, wait a second — wasn’t Dead Reckoning suppose to open to $90M over five days? This is surely an upset, no? The reality of the situation here stateside is that there isn’t any Top Gun: Maverick halo effect. That long-awaited sequel brought out non-moviegoers, people who haven’t been to the movies in years. Dead Reckoning is bringing its finite, older-skewing fanbase. As a Mission movie, Dead Reckoning‘s start here isn’t below its franchise expectations.\n\nHold on again – doesn’t Dead Reckoning stand to lose as much money as Dial of Destiny? Both cost about the same. What’s clear is that the industry is still releasing over-budgeted movies that were challenged by Covid stops; Dead Reckoning being one of the first movies to shut down because of the pandemic in Italy back in early 2020. The box office to profit measure for some of these tentpoles is still a hurdle, and will continue to be for a while. These movies weren’t made under normal circumstances, and Disney and Paramount both invested heavily in prime IP under the notion that they would deliver, and it’s better to perfect and avoid scaling back costs. Who doesn’t want to invest more on a trusted franchise sequel, especially a global star who delivered one of the highest-grossing movies of last year in Top Gun: Maverick?\n\nHowever, as we said above — the word of mouth on Dead Reckoning will empower it, even with Barbie next weekend potentially posting Little Mermaid numbers ($95M+ 3-day) and adult-leaning Oppenheimer in the mix, and that buzz will carry the Cruise film through all ancillaries.\n\nLet’s step back again and assess — Dead Reckoning is posting a lower 3-day and 5-day next to Dial of Destiny. Why is that? The notion is that with Dead Reckoning having all the goods in great reviews and audience exits, there was no reason for it to debut on a Wednesday stateside. The movie could have gone on Friday and saw a $78M 3-day, which would have been a record opening for the Cruise series. I was under the impression that the movie, at a long running time of 2 hours and 43 minutes, would benefit from a 5-day launch, given that there’s fewer showtimes at cinemas, and it would propel word of mouth. However, another source splashed water in my face and reminded me that the exhibition infrastructure as it is has the capacity and the power to deliver enormous box office grosses: Hello, Avengers: Endgame was a three-hour movie and holds the opening domestic box office record opening with $357.1M.\n\nLike Indy, could Mission have expanded to a younger audience? Of course, and Cruise might want to consider hiring some popular YA stars for future sequels. Imagine the juiced gross on a Mission: Impossible if Harry Styles or Zendaya were part of the ensemble.\n\nCourtesy Everett Collection Everett Collection\n\nThe Cruise sequel is playing strongest in the East, West & Mountain. Meanwhile, red state fave Sound of Freedom is throwing off those percentages, as it’s so strong in the middle of the country. Meanwhile, 53% of Sound of Freedom‘s $23.6M second weekend (up a massive 20%) is coming from the South, South Central, and Midwest (parts of the country that do very well with Cruise movies).\n\nPLFs and Imax screens are driving 42% of Dead Reckoning‘s business to date.\n\nIn 13 days, Sound of Freedom, with $82M, will have made more than Everything Everywhere All at Once‘s lifetime domestic of $77.1M. Of course, both movies appeal to polar opposites. But it’s interesting to note their comparison, as both movies were unexpected outliers that were unforeseen in their success at the B.O.\n\nThis movie is stoking the Fox News Channel crowd to get out to the movies, and is appealing to them in its subject of child-trafficking, something which some right wingers believe is the fault of the left. The movie’s success is a testament to its star, title, and release date: It headlines Jesus (Jim Caviezel from Passion of the Christ), and the distributor, Angels Studios, was adamant that the movie open on July 4. Why? The picture has the word “Freedom” in the title, and that says something to the red state crowd, especially on the Day of Independence.\n\nTotal weekend box office is an estimated $130.3M from all titles, off 2% from a year ago, when Thor: Love and Thunder led the box office in its second weekend, and +3% from pre-pandemic 2019, when Spider-Man: Far From Home held No. 1 in its second frame.\n\n1.)

The Little Mermaid (Dis) 1,615 (-465) theaters, Fri $675K (-38%) 3-day $2.2M (-40%) Total $293.7M/ Wk 8\n\nUPDATE FRIDAY PM: As we told you, it’s all about global when it comes to the opening of Paramount/Skydance’s Tom Cruise sequel Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One and we hear a $240 million global start is being forecasted right now. Stateside, the 5-day is $76M after what is expected to be a $16M Friday and $52.2M 3-day at 4,327 theaters. Offshore opening will be $164M.\n\nAnything north of a $78.8M 5-day domestic is an opening record for the franchise stateside; currently, that benchmark is owned by the Wednesday-through-Sunday start of 2000’s Mission: Impossible II. (Deadline’s Nancy Tartaglione will have more details on foreign later this weekend.) China is eyeing a $27M-$30M weekend, not too shabby for a Hollywood film now. We’ll take it. The last Mission: Impossible, 2018’s Fallout, posted a $76.1M in the PRC (not accounting for inflation and currency swings); that was a much different time for Hollywood movies. Note Japan, a big Mission market, isn’t in this opening suite.\n\nAngel Studios’ Sound of Freedom continues to ring loudly at 3,265 theaters with a second Friday of $6M (+15%), a second weekend between $20M-$22.5M, and running cume that could reach $81M by EOD Sunday. This Jim Caviezel thriller is bound for a $100M-plus gross. Rivals are even betting substantially more.\n\nSony/Stage 6 Films/Blumhouse’s Insidious: The Red Door is seeing a $4.35M Friday, -71%, with a second weekend of $13.5M, -59%, and running total by Sunday of $58.6M at 3,188 theaters.\n\nDisney/Lucasfilm’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, booked at 3,865 spots, is seeing a third Friday of $3.6M, -53%, and third weekend of $12.9M, -53%, and a running total by Sunday of $146.2M.\n\nDisney/Pixar’s Elemental continues to hold in the top five with an estimated fifth weekend of $8.8M, a great -12% hold, and a running total of $125.3M. That will fire it past Lightyear‘s final domestic of $118.3M. Friday is estimated to be around $2.5M at 3,235 theaters.\n\nUPDATE, FRIDAY AM: Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One saw $8.3 million million on Thursday, repping a 47% decline from the Wednesday opening plus previews of $15.5M. The two-day total for the Paramount/Skydance feature is $23.8M from 4,049 theaters. Hopefully this film spikes today. I mean, it will spike today, it’s just by how much given that A CinemaScore and 4 1/2 stars and 88% on Screen Engine/Comscore’s PostTrak. Guys at 65% gave the movie its best grades at 90%. Women at 35% weren’t that far behind at 86%.\n\nA $90M five-day total seems unlikely, with rivals spotting $50M over three days and $73M over five. We’ll dissect what’s up here on this near-$300M production as the numbers become clearer; the feature went through several Covid delays. Right now M:I‘s box office looks similar to that of Paramount’s 2017 Transformers: The Last Knight, which was another long movie at 2 hours and 34 minutes that opened on Wednesday to $15.6M and Thursday to $8.1M for a two-day of $23.7M. However, that was largely a younger-guy-skewing feature versus the 74% over 25 here; and it was a B+ picture and not one of the fan-faves for the robots-in-disguise series. Last Knight‘s first Friday was $13.7M.\n\nLast night’s 7 p.m. Dolby auditorium show for Dead Reckoning at the AMC Porter Ranch (30 minutes north of Los Angeles, and where Nicole Kidman shot the exhib’s commercial) was nearly sold out. What that exemplifies for these big tentpoles is that we’re under-screened when it comes to premium-format auditoriums. There’s no reason why a big star like Tom Cruise should have to go around asking for more PLF screens on a movie for which he’s already doing 360-degree press; exhibition has to build more of them if we’re going to expand the marketplace. Mission is expected to have its grab of PLFs next weekend despite Universal’s three-hour Christopher Nolan epic Oppenheimer muscling in.\n\nSpeaking of publicity, especially at a time when there aren’t any late-night talk shows, Dead Reckoning had a ton of it. Cruise is becoming a rare movie star, together with Dwayne Johnson, who knows how to go all out in making a movie a fire-breathing event and having the world know about it. I mean, this movie was promoted at two different CinemaCons, 2021 and 2022; there was the Rome premiere where the pic was shot including a mind-blowing chase scene; as well as multiple global stops by Cruise. RelishMix says that the social media universe reach for Dead Reckoning is at an awesome 529.9M across TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube views, which is ahead of Top Gun: Maverick (401.5 SMU/$126.7M opening), John Wick 4 (452.3M SMU/$73.8M opening) and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (296.4M/$60.3m opening).\n\n‘Sound of Freedom’ Everett\n\nMeanwhile, Angel Studios’ Sound of Freedom continues to wow. The pic posted daily middays of $4M+, out-pegging Sony/Stage 6 Films/Blumhouse’s Insidious: The Red Door every day. The latter pic took No. 1 last weekend with $33M. On Thursday, Sound of Freedom grossed an estimated $4.5M, +4% over Wednesday. Pic’s last seven days grossed $36.5M for a running total of $58.5M. Angel Studios released a statement yesterday, squashing rumors that AMC has made it difficult for patrons to see the movie. That’s fake news, with the circuit selling more than 1 million tickets so far for the Jim Caviezel thriller. The pic is getting 450 theaters added to the current count of 2,852 theaters.\n\nRed Door was third on Thursday with $2.5M, -1% from Wednesday and a first week of $45M at 3,188 locations.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny did $2.3M on Thursday at 4,600 theaters, even with Wednesday, for a second-week take of $38.6M and a running total of $133.3M.\n\n‘Elemental’ Disney\n\nDisney has fifth place with Elemental and a fourth Thursday of $1.6M, +6% from Wednesday, with a $17M fourth week; its running total is $116.5M at 3,440 theaters. Get a load of this: Despite the Pixar movie opening lower than Lightyear, $29.6M to $50.5M, it’s going to outstrip that Toy Story spinoff’s final domestic total of $118.3M.\n\nUPDATED THURSDAY AM: Paramount reported $15.5M for the Wednesday opening day of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, which includes previews. The studio isn’t reporting a 3 and 5-day projection as those type of forecasts can be wonky and it ultimately boils down to Friday business.\n\nRivals, however, are betting at this point in time that Dead Reckoning isn’t as big as the $90M tracking purported it to be. More like $47M for the 3-day and $70.5M per industry estimates right now. The worry here is if this is Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny all over again with a very expensive film near $300M production cost, long-running time and older dude skewing franchise falling short of expectations. There’s a chance on a five-day basis, this could still be a franchise record start: Mission: Impossible II has the best five-day opening for the Cruise series at $78.8M.\n\nWith a running time of 2 hours and 43 minutes, it’s clear that Dead Reckoning is appointment viewing for moviegoers like Avatar: The Way of Water and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. However, it’s a fast 2 hours and 43 minutes given the awesome action set pieces in the movie.\n\nLast night on Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak, Dead Reckoning looked similar to Indy‘s Thursday night demos with 34% over 45, 74% over 25 and heavily male at 65%.\n\nHowever, here’s the box office viagra that Ethan Hunt has over Indiana Jones, and hopefully this will bode well in spreading word of mouth, especially with the younger demos: Dead Reckoning has an A CinemaScore to Dial of Destiny‘s B+. That’s the second A for a Mission movie after 2018’s Fallout. The franchise counts three A- grades for Rogue Nation, Mission Impossible III and Ghost Protocol. Mission: Impossible did B+ while Mission: Impossible II got a B. It’s also one of the best reviewed Missions of all-time at 96% certified fresh to Fallout‘s 97% certified fresh. In addition, Mission‘s edge over Indy is that Cruise and the franchise are more of a draw at the overseas boxoffice than the Lucasfilm IP (which isn’t even known in certain big markets like China). Korea and Japan are expected to be big for Dead Reckoning. It’s overseas in the end that could possibly bail this very pricey Mission movie out. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny opened to $130M WW, with a domestic 3-day of $60.3M. The Friday-Tuesday five day was $83.8M. Current global on the Lucasfilm franchise finale is north of $256M WW.\n\nOn social media, RelishMix spots, “Convo tone on Dead Reckoning runs positive as fans acknowledge Tom Cruise’s tireless tenacity as Hollywood’s modern daredevil, proclaiming he’s ‘hauling modern cinema on his back.’ Paired with filmmaker Christoper McQuarrie’s daring direction and newcomer Hayley Atwell, some already herald it as potentially ‘the best action movie of all time.’ This series is being elevated above competitors, notably Fast X and The Fast and Furious franchise, with fans assertively favoring its consistently epic entries — ‘This franchise is the movie embodiment of aged fine wine.’ Even with a chorus of praise, a handful of viewers yearn for fresh elements, countering the franchise’s predictable beats. Yet, the Mission: Impossible saga continues its powerful performance, captivating its loyal audience and igniting anticipation for this new chapter.”\n\nUPDATED WEDNESDAY PM: Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One‘s opening day is looking like $16 million, which includes the $7M in previews.\n\nYes, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny and Mission: Impossible – Fallout both posted first days in the $22M-$23M range, but those were Fridays. This is about the long play of the movie, and Tom Cruise fare is back-loaded. The reason why this pic is going for the five-day record is due to its length, at 2 hours and 43 minutes. It’s expected, especially with a current great Rotten Tomatoes audience score of 94%, to get to $90M, a franchise record opening, by Sunday. Again, it’s still early. These numbers could go up.\n\nSound of Freedom is looking at second place with $3.9M and a running total of $53.4M. That daily gross is holding steady with Monday and Tuesday. Very impressive.\n\nUPDATE AFTER EXCLUSIVE: Paramount/Skydance’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One came in at the high end of expectations with $7M in previews. Pic was booked at 3,300 locations and hikes its theater count up to 4,000-plus today including Imax and PLF.\n\nI’m told that the fan PLF money from Monday shows isn’t included in that $7M figure. The previous chapter, Mission: Impossible – Fallout posted Thursday previews of $6M, a record for the franchise. Next to other summer comps, Disney/Lucasfilm’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny posted $7.2M in previews.\n\nThe Rotten Tomatoes audience score out of the gate after previews is 94%.\n\nTom Cruise and filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie have been touring the film; the duo making stops in Toronto, Atlanta, Miami, and Washington DC, greeting fans at cinemas.\n\nTom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie make a surprise appearance Tuesday at ‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One’ screening at the AMC Sunset Place 24 in South Miami Getty/Paramount\n\nYessica Borroto Perryman in ‘Sound of Freedom’ Everett Collection\n\nIn early estimates this morning, Angel Studio’ Jim Caviezel thriller Sound of Freedom won another weekday with $4M yesterday, beating Sony/Blumhouse/Stage 6 Films’ Insidious: The Red Door which had $3.48M. Both pics had even holds from Monday percent-wise. Sound of Freedom raises its running total to $49.7M in its eight-day run. Wow. It’s expected that the pic will post a -30% ease in weekend 2 with around $13M-$14M after a $19.6M reported 3-day last week. Red Door‘s five day run rises to $40M.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Paramount/Skydance’s Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning – Part One is looking at $6M-$7M in previews so far, which is bound to be higher than the Thursday previews of the last Mission Impossible – Fallout back in 2018 which did $6M. This is according to sources. The figures we’re seeing now could go higher or lower.\n\nDead Reckoning previews began at 2PM today, however, I hear there were PLF fan screenings on Monday and that handful of bucks is accounted for in the estimate.\n\nDead Reckoning is one of the longer films of the summer at 2 hours and 43 minutes with credits. Not as long as Oppenheimer‘s 3 hours (opening on July 21), but longer than Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2 hours and 34 minutes) and The Flash (2 hours and 24 minutes). However, the action is unlike anything any Mission Impossible or Fast and Furious movie has ever delivered before. Seriously, that Rome, Italy car chase will make you want to see the movie again. Paramount is going for a Mission:Impossible franchise five-day record here with a Wednesday start, which is smart given this sequel’s length and the limited amount of showtimes exhibitors can program. Disney did not execute a Wednesday start with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, another older dude skewing film, the studio opting for a Friday launch and seeing $60.3M over three days before July 4.\n\nThe best reviewed Mission: Impossible of all-time at 98% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, Dead Reckoning is projected to have a $90M five-day stateside, $250M+ worldwide.\n\nLast year, the decades long-awaited sequel Top Gun: Maverick posted the best box office results of Cruise’s career with $19.3M in U.S. previews, $126.7M domestic opening, and $256.4M WW start. The pic finaled at $718.7M domestic (No. 1 pic for 2023 domestic), $1.49 billion WW (No 2 global for 2023 after Avatar: The Way of Water).\n\nMission: Impossible – Fallout opened to $61.2M domestic, and legged out to $220.1M domestic, and $791.6M WW. Even if Mission comes up short this weekend, remember, Cruise’s movies are always backloaded at the B.O."

        "text": "Tom Cruise‘s latest blockbuster “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” is showing strength at the international box office, collecting an impressive $155 million from 70 markets.\n\nAlong with an estimated $80 million at the domestic box office, “Mission: Impossible” has grossed $235 million globally through its first five days of release. That’s a mighty worldwide tally, especially for the seventh installment in a 27-year-old action franchise. Imax screens contributed $25 million, including a new franchise-record of $14 million overseas.\n\nThe only trouble is the movie, which finds Cruise’s durable hero Ethan Hunt defying death as he flies off a mountain on his motorcycle, scales a runaway train and maneuvers a tiny car through the bustling streets of Rome, was incredibly expensive to make. Due to COVID-related starts and stops and other pandemic-era safety measures, Paramount and Skydance spent $291 million before marketing costs. So even as Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” and Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” open on July 21, “Dead Reckoning Part One” needs to continue resonating at the global box office to turn a profit in its theatrical run.\n\nThe good news is that “Mission: Impossible” movies have a history of overcoming smaller opening weekends at the box office. In 2018, “Mission: Impossible – Fallout,” for example, collected $61 million domestically to start and ended up setting a series record with $791 million globally. Moreover, “Mission” movies tend to earn roughly 70% of overall ticket sales at the international box office. That’ll help offset any trouble at the domestic box office, where “Dead Reckoning” is currently behind initial projections.\n\n“Mission: Impossible 7” fell short of expectations in China with $25.4 million, which is 66% below “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” ($74 million). But elsewhere, the film established new franchise opening weekend records in 35 markets, including the United Kingdom ($13.8 million), India ($9 million), Australia ($8.3 million) and New Zealand ($1.5 million). Other top-earning territories were Korea ($14.3 million), France ($7.7 million) and Taiwan ($7.7 million).\n\nChristopher McQuarrie returned to direct the latest installment, which follows Ethan Hunt and his team at the Impossible Mission Force as they work to take down a mysterious, all-powerful artificial intelligence force known as the Entity. Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Esai Morales, Vanessa Kirby and Pom Klementieff round out the cast."

        "text": "Warning: This article contains mild spoilers for Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.\n\nJulia Roberts could have played a very important part in Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One as one of the brunette women Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) just can't seem to keep alive, no matter how hard he tries.\n\nIn a new Empire Spoiler Special film podcast interview, director/co-writer Christopher McQuarrie revealed he considered casting Roberts and digitally de-aging her to play a role in the flashback scenes that show how Ethan and villain Gabriel (Esai Morales) are connected. In the past, Gabriel murdered Ethan's girlfriend Marie and framed him for her death. In the film, Marie is played by Mariela Garriga, but McQuarrie reveals that he originally wanted to cast a megastar from the time period of the first Mission: Impossible film.\n\nTom Cruise in 'Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One'; Julia Roberts. Paramount Pictures and Skydance; Theo Wargo/Getty Images\n\n\"If you hire Esai Morales and Tom Cruise and de-age them, and then hire some 23-year-old woman to be their confidant in Berlin in 1989, that's bulls---,\" McQuarrie said. \"We started looking at it and saying, 'Who's Marie going to be? Who from that era would Marie have been? It would be Tom in, say, 1989, it would be Tony Scott's Mission: Impossible — that's who would have been directing the movie before Brian De Palma in that era... I looked back at who was the ingenue, who was the breakout star in 1989? And right around then was Mystic Pizza, and I was like, 'Oh my God. Julia Roberts. A then-pre-Pretty Woman Julia Roberts as this young woman.'\"\n\nThe director goes on to explain that the only way he \"could have seen doing the sequence justice was to somehow convince Julia Roberts to come in and be this small role at the beginning of this story.\" He originally wanted the flashback scene to be longer as well, but ultimately decided it would be too distracting for audiences to see Roberts, Cruise, Morales, and Henry Czerny (who plays former IMF chief Eugene Kittridge) looking almost 30 years younger via digital de-aging visual effects.\n\n\"The best de-aging I've ever looked at, all I kept thinking is, 'Wow, this de-aging is really good.' I'm in no way, shape, or form connecting to the story,\" he said. \"As you're conceptually going through it, you're like, 'Now all anybody's going to be doing is thinking about the de-aging of Julia Roberts, and Esai, and Tom, and Henry Czerny.'\"\n\nThere was also a much simpler reason why McQuarrie decided against the idea: It cost too much money.\n\n\"I got the bill for de-aging those people before their salaries were even factored into it,\" he said. \"And if you put two of them in a shot together, or three of them in a shot together, it would have been as expensive as the [massive third act action scene set on the] train by the time we were done.\"\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is in theaters now.\n\nWant more movie news?

        "text": "DD: Not just one Mission Impossible, but two, the latest Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One with Tom Cruise returning as agent Ethan Hunt in the 7th installment in the series, and Oppenheimer, with Cillian Murphy in Christopher Nolan’s large-screen epic about the race to beat Germany to the atomic bomb in WWII. Our film critic, Harlan Jacobson, ties them together and jumps.\n\nHJ: The film universe is atwitter – you should pardon the expression--with Barbieheimer, the race between two mass market films, Barbie and Oppenheimer, that are both opening this weekend to chase big numbers at the box office like the old days, pre-everything. At least as interesting is the performance test between Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning and Oppenheimer. Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer are in their way similar and what the industry needs—fresh auteurist visions where one is light satire with a feminist intent, and the other a dark mea culpa on the use and abuse of male power. But Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning represents the continued uninspired retooling of past franchises – Bond, Bat, Super and Spiderman, Marvels that are no longer marvels -- that are the default position of risk-averse corporate filmmaking. This is the cancer that was eating away at theatrical attendance 30 years before the pandemic landed theaters in the ICU.\n\nHarlan Jacobson Tom Cruise stars as \"Ethan Hunt\" in Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One\n\nWriter-director Christopher McQuarrie’s Dead Reckoning with Tom Cruise hopping from planes to trains and at least one clown car, and Oppenheimer with the lesser-known Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man who birthed the atom bomb and regretted it even before the fallout rained down, however, are both about missions impossible—to save the planet for good or ill. Oppenheimer, however, is the bet made by visionary filmmaking associated with the great American indie explosion of the early 70s in Marty Scorsese and especially Francis Ford Coppola that the way forward is by investigating the American character, in fiction or in history, to take the pulse of the culture in which we now live.\n\nDead Reckoning did well in its first week out. And given that everyone in the industry, specially during these strike months, is watching the vital signs of both theatres and distributors, that’s a cheering sign if you care about the biz. But the health of the art — meaningful, fresh character narrative that has Tolstoy’s aspirations to paint the broader moment and David Lean’s imperative to make it big – lies with Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, lensed by his cameraman on Tenet, Dunkirk and Interstellar, Hoyte Van Hoytema. It's spirit may lie with American indie filmmaking, but Oppenheimer was made using the elite and expensive cutting edge tech tools of film, crafted by people at the top of their art, with limitless resources backed by a studio, Universal, releasing it in standard film, digital IMAX, and in its best iteration that matches how it was shot on a 70-millimeter IMAX film camera – shown at a premium price of $26.99 at Loews 68th Street in NYC, one of 19 theaters in the US and 30 worldwide equipped to show it.\n\nNolan’s 12th film – you may remember his Memento back in 2000 about what we need to remember -- has two principal concerns on its mind: 1) the moral no-man’s land entered by Oppy, the scientist given a sports team nickname when he led the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos to build the atomic bombs dropped on Japan to end the war, and 2) the ensuing security driven fascism of the Communist witch hunt in Congress less than a decade later that destroyed Oppenheimer’s reputation and his career. At three hours and distilled from the 2006 Pulitzer Prize winning 700 -page book, American Prometheus, The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by former Nation columnist Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film’s arc follows Oppenheimer from his days as a university student who was a lab klutz but a good theoretical physics thinker, through his selection to bring the bomb to bear on the war effort, and the multiple layers of tragedy that ensue.\n\nThere are the overlapping politics of university life, military protocols, the war, the post war madness, and the personal dynamics, from marriage to professional egos, that must be threaded and orchestrated on a metronome keyed at first to the German head start on developing a bomb, led by Werner Heisenberg, he of the already famous Heisenberg principle that if you can see it, you’ve altered its nature. Then the metronome of The Red Scare takes over, and we watch Murphy’s 60-foot face trying to reconcile his heartsickness with the inexorable political buzzsaw of petit tyrants coming at him that Sean Connery’s James Bond or Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt routinely escape.\n\nThe film is peopled by front rank actors at the top of their power – Murphy as Oppy, Emily Blunt as his wife Kitty, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr. in a standout turn as Oppy’s Brutus, Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh (as Niels Bohr), David Krumholtz, Bennie Safdie (Edward Teller), Josh Hartnett, Rami Malek, Casey Affleck, Florence Pugh and Gary Oldman as a chameleon Harry Truman. Nolan returns to the screen 80s British leading man Tom Conti as Albert Einstein and Josh Peck, lost since Nickelodeon’s 2004 series, Drake & Josh, as the nervous wreck here who pushes the button at Los Alamos.\n\nNolan’s film positions Oppenheimer to understand the necessity of the project, even as the swirl historically pondered how, especially where and whether to use it. Oppenheimer in Nolan is divided against himself. Even on a screen as large as a football field, there’s a lot of one-on-one ruminations before and after the countdown to the Trinity test blast, which Nolan creates in a fireball, and the ultimate bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki delivered more demurely here over a radio report and newsreel aftermath. Oppenheimer is ultimately ruined as a Communist security risk by Senate investigations shown here that drop out to IMAX in black and white. But how we see him hinges on one line, when he responds to a colleague’s private suggestion that the bomb is so terrible they really ought to keep the Soviets in the loop. The film stops for a beat. “That would be treason,” Oppenheimer says here, and he’s having none of that. Ergo, chalk up Oppy as another wronged patriot and a man so traumatized by doubt he’s incapable of defending himself in the face of the fascist McCarthy period.\n\nEverything in America always does come down to how Walt Kelly summarized it in Pogo long ago: “We have met the enemy, and they is us.” This Oppenheimer is brave, ambitious, magnificently accomplished in its filmmaking and on point.\n\nThis 7th in the series of Mission Impossibles, Dead Reckoning, begins in a super stealth Russian sub that yields a lot of dead Russians bobbing up beneath the Arctic ice cap and a two-part, interlocking brass key vital to defeat the enemy and save the planet. The hunt is on! Through two hours and 43 minutes, I never did figure out who the enemy is that Cruise as the returning rogue agent Ethan Hunt is battling. He’s got it going on two fronts: his own CIA on the one hand and on the other what?, who? huh?\n\nIt helps if the times you live in afford an enemy that corresponds to the real world, but here it’s abstracted into a metaphor called The Entity. (How’s that for a screenwriter hedge?) After all the high tech stuff the CIA uses and Cruise abuses in this film, I never did get how the fate of the planet hinges on finding a brass key? I kept thinking that key sure looks like the one my parents used to open a Chinese dry bar (with pearl inlays) that my father bought for our living room in 1958 at the LS Ayres Dept store in Indianapolis and which my brother transferred from my pile to his pile when we closed up the house in Toledo. “Ethan, don’t kill yourself, my brother has a key like that on Fullerton Ave in Chicago,” I wanted to shout.\n\nNo worries, as Cruise, Hayley Atwell as hot female agent Grace, Ving Rhames as the sidekick and Simon Pegg as the techie, engage in a millisecond by millisecond never-ending pitched battle with The Entity, transversing the globe to do chop-socky stunts on the roof of a speeding train, a slap-stick shift tear through Rome in a circus yellow Fiat 500, and leaps of faith over rooftops in Venice and the Swiss Alps and across the sands of Abu Dhabi in a mission that plays out as really quite possible after all to save the world. Yes, Tom Cruise is a Unicorn, as my son calls him. And as with all franchise victories, Carvel Cone afterwards.\n\nI'm Harlan Jacobson"

        "text": "Tom Cruise, the star who is credited with saving the box office after Top Gun: Maverick flew to $1.5 billion in global ticket sales, is now facing another kind of reckoning — surviving the Barbenheimer effect.\n\nHis Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One tumbled a franchise-worst 64 percent to $19.5 million in its second weekend when going up against Barbie and Oppenheimer, whose dual arrivals transformed into a cultural phenomenon and propelled the domestic box office to historic heights. Revenue for the July 21-23 weekend was the fourth-biggest of all time; in addition, it was the first time ever that one movie opened to $100 million or more and another to $50 million or more. Barbie scored $155 million, followed by $80.5 million for Oppenheimer. No one in Hollywood anticipated such a staggering turnout.\n\nThe seventh installment in Paramount and Skydance’s storied Mission: Impossible series, which finished Sunday with a domestic total of $118.8 million, had hoped to earn as much as $25 million in its second outing.\n\nThe question now is whether Dead Reckoning Part One can level out and enjoy a long run as other series installments have done, and just as Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick did. Executives across Hollywood, and not just at Paramount, aren’t ruling Dead Reckoning out just yet, especially since it has a better critics’ score on Rotten Tomatoes than Barbie and Oppenheimer, as well as strong audience exit scores.\n\n“I don’t think the story has yet been written,” says one executive at a rival studio.\n\nMission: Impossible pics have never sported mega-openings, yet expectations were high for Dead Reckoning after Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick opened to $160.5 million over Memorial Day weekend in 2022, including $126.7 million for the three days. Dead Reckoning had been tracking to open to $90 million in its first five days beginning July 12; instead, it took in a franchise-best $78.5 million, not adjusted for inflation.\n\nTitles in the Mission franchise have always drawn a larger percentage of their global gross from the foreign box office. Dead Reckoning Part One is no exception. It earned another $55 million from 72 markets in its second weekend for a foreign tally of $252.1 million and $370.9 million globally through Sunday. It is doing especially well in Asia, where Barbie and Oppenheimer aren’t strong players. And in a number of markets, it is pacing 15 percent or more ahead of 2018’s Mission: Impossible — Fallout. In Japan, it debuted to $7.9 million, 23 percent ahead of Fallout, which earned a franchise-best $571.5 million overseas for a global total of $791.7 million, including $220.2 million in North America.\n\nMission: Impossible 7 had to contend with losing Imax screens for three weeks to Oppenheimer, in addition to losing premium large-format screens to both Oppenheimer and Barbie. The upcharge for Imax and PLFs is significant and can have a big impact on the bottom line. In early July, Imax screens were dedicated to Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.\n\nCruise’s latest movie, directed by Christopher McQuarrie, cost nearly $300 million to produce and saw its release date delayed numerous times because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was initially set to open in summer of 2021, then summer or fall of 2022. Its release date ultimately landed on mid-July of this year, a date dictated by the shooting schedule of Dead Reckoning Part Two and Cruise’s availability to promote Part One (the actor is known for his global marketing efforts).\n\nAdds another observer: “Barbenheimer siphoned off MI7′s potential this weekend, with Oppenheimer drawing older males away from Dead Reckoning. Not only that, Sound of Freedom is an unexpected force to be reckoned with and is presenting competition from an unlikely source.”\n\nEstimates for the U.S. box office show Angel Studios’ faith-based political thriller Sound of Freedom beating Dead Reckoning for the weekend with $20.1 million for a cume of $123.4 million (Sound of Freedom opened July 4), according to Comscore. Paramount and other studios show Dead Reckoning beating Sound of Freedom; Monday actuals will determine the order.\n\nMission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part Two is set to open in theaters June 28, 2024. McQuarrie and Cruise have shot much of the movie, but production is now halted because of the SAG-AFTRA strike in another moment of reckoning for the storied action franchise.\n\nThings looked different in late June, when Cruise — Hollywood’s highest-profile advocate for the theatrical experience — urged audiences to see Dial of Destiny. And, yes, two other movies in a surprisingly effective plea. Wrote the actor on Instagram : “I love a double feature, and it doesn’t get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig’s Barbie.”"

        "text": "In 2013, when Hayley Atwell took the stage for Trafalgar Studios’ production of The Pride, she had no idea that future co-architect of the Mission: Impossible franchise, Christopher “McQ” McQuarrie, was in attendance. Atwell had already read for McQ and Tom Cruise’s 2012 film, Jack Reacher, but on this particular occasion, McQ was so gobsmacked by her live performance that he took the actor out to dinner and stated his intentions to write a role for her someday. Well, someday became 2019, as McQ and Cruise needed a new leading lady to play Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One’s master thief, Grace.\n\nAtwell has waited over 17 years for an opportunity like this in a blockbuster film. Yes, she’s played the fan-favorite Peggy Carter at least a half-dozen times in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but her big screen opportunities were almost always in service of another character’s story, that of Steve Rogers/Captain America. In Dead Reckoning Part One, Atwell is finally at the center of a tentpole feature, and that is evident when Grace gets the better of Cruise’s Ethan Hunt multiple times during the first half of the film.\n\n“I was finally given the trust and the platform … to show more range and to show more emotional depth in a franchise or something of this size, which I hadn’t been afforded before,” Atwell tells The Hollywood Reporter in a conversation conducted ahead of the SAG-AFTRA strike. “And so I have this eternal gratitude to Tom and to McQ, who provided the resources and the support system every day on set so that I could thrive. It’s been a deliverance of a long time coming. After 17 years in this industry, I’ve finally been able to do something at this level, with this quality of filmmaking, and I’d never been afforded that before.”\n\nIn a production filled with indelible moments, Atwell will never forget a rainy day in Rome, where she drifted during a car chase, all while Cruise was handcuffed to her.\n\n“There’s about 20 minutes of footage of us [drifting] over and over again,” Atwell says. “And then Tom led a round of applause from the crew, and McQ said, ‘Tom put his life in your hands just then and he wouldn’t have allowed you to do that had he not believed that you could look after him, too.’ So they’re never short on their praise for when actors come in and deliver for them. That’s a moment I’ll never forget.”\n\nBelow, during a conversation with THR, Atwell also discusses Grace’s real name and backstory, before previewing Dead Reckoning Part Two’s Arctic location in Svalbard, Norway.\n\nSo, if I recall correctly, McQ was impressed by your work in a play after you were already in the mix for Jack Reacher, and he’s kept you in mind ever since. Is that the basic origin story?\n\nThat’s correct, yes. McQ saw me in The Pride in Trafalgar Studios about ten years ago. He took me out for dinner after and said, “That thing you did on that stage, I want it. I want to bottle it. I don’t know what the character or story would be …” So he’s never forgotten it, and he quoted back a line to me from The Pride the other day. It’s like, “Wow, it really stayed with him.” The character is overcome with this really difficult period in life, and she just says, “All that wasted time.” And so he said it to me. McQ is a really good actor. He’s very engaging. He delivered it in such a beautiful, emotional way, and it took me right back to that moment.\n\nHayley Atwell and Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One Courtesy of Paramount Pictures and Skydance\n\nAs a highly trained actor, how did you take to a process where the story and the character are still in flux throughout production?\n\nI think my classical training allowed me to surrender to the process of it, without sounding too arty. When you do a degree of three years, you’re trying out lots of different things and failing on a daily basis, or at least you’re feeling like you are. You’re taking lots of risks and you don’t know what skill set you have. You’re still honing in that toolkit. So it put me in good stead of having a work ethic, and if I trust the filmmakers I’m working with to only put into the movie the thing that’s gonna serve the story, then there’s a freedom in it and I can try lots of different things.\n\nWith Grace, I really wanted her to be more than one thing, because we are all more than one thing. She has her moments of self-assurance and then self-doubt, and courage and then fear, in the face of these high stakes. So that sense of not knowing, that hypervigilance, is with her throughout, and I just felt like I could ground her and give her a bit more depth than just relying on the physical visual spectacle that we were creating.\n\nSo there’s footage of the cast watching Tom’s motorcycle jump on day one, and almost everybody started laughing once he went over the edge. Was the laughter a way to cope with the sheer terror of what he was doing?\n\nI think it was just the exasperation. We’d heard about this, and we’d seen him in preparation and training for it. We’d seen the engineers design and build that ramp at that location. We’d seen him that morning jump off the helicopter over that precipice to test the wind, and so the laughter came out of just awe. A man was risking his life for the movie and to delight his audiences. I actually laughed more once I’d heard that the canopy had successfully been deployed and he’d made it back to the ground. I laughed even harder when the first words out of his mouth were something like, “Okay, I think I can go further off the motorbike.” He was immediately giving himself notes about how to do it better next time. He was like, “Okay, yep. We got that one. Let’s move on.” So the sheer dedication to craft and to entertain just takes your breath away.\n\nHayley Atwell and Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One Courtesy of Paramount Pictures and Skydance\n\nHayley, you are the only person in recorded history who’s experienced a car chase in Rome while handcuffed to Tom Cruise.\n\n(Laughs.)\n\nSo, what do you want the history books to know about this experience?\n\nThat being outside of your comfort zone can lead to very unexpected beautiful things if you trust your scene partner and if you’ve done the preparation that it takes to be able to put yourself in a situation like that, not only to do it safely, but also to be able to throw out different performances. And Tom, as we all know, is so diligent in his preparation and his discipline, and that becomes very contagious for me to want to also meet him at those intense places. I also knew that there was this huge safety net there and that he’s not reckless, so we were able to have fun with it.\n\nEthan pulls her file and then extrapolates as to what Grace’s likely backstory is, and I loved the way you played that moment with this almost prideful look on your face. Do you think he was right on the money?\n\nYeah, it helped me a lot, because I’d already started shooting before they’d written that scene. So I wasn’t sure exactly about the backstory that they would give her, and I’m really pleased that they did say that she’s an orphan. Her need for survival turned her into an opportunist and someone who wanted nice things, “other people’s things,” because she hadn’t come from any sort of privilege or luxury. And I thought, “Okay, that makes sense for the choices that she makes and the way that she changes the plot and pulls the rug from underneath his feet.” She’s not doing that because she enjoys watching other people suffer. She’s doing it because she has a very strong need to survive and be hyper independent in the world.\n\nI know this is an action franchise, but I do try to work out a psychological profile for a character I’m playing, so I can root her in something that often comes from a core wound. And I thought, “Well, how great,” because it shows me there in that moment that if human beings are wired for connection, then that is the reason why we can survive our attachment to our primary caregivers or the world that we are born into. But if she can’t do that, then she’s very fearful of other people. She can’t trust them. Maybe she’s been betrayed by them, and so out of that comes why she does the things she does. And I thought, “They’ve hit the nail on the head of being able to have the audience not despise her or dislike her for all the things she does,” particularly to Ethan at the beginning of the movie. You go, “Okay, so she comes from that perspective. That makes more sense.” It’s a more humane way as to why she does the thing she does.\n\nWhen Ethan asks for her name, she says, “How about Grace?” which implies that it’s not her real name. I think you can actually see a few letters of her real name on a passport later in the film. [Writer’s Note: “Fr Mar” is visible on the third-act passport.] But do you know her real name yet?\n\nIt wasn’t until after we finished filming and McQ had inserted a closeup of this passport where you do see those couple of names, that he sent me the name and some backstory about the name and where it came from. And I thought, “Oh, that’s such a good Easter egg.” And who knows if that is another alias? But I think it’s probably gonna be explored more in Part Two. Their attention to detail when it comes to little things like that is really fun for an actor. It’s also fun for the fans to be able to go back and go, “Oh, that moment was planted early on.” It’s a lovely callback and shows the attention that McQ as a filmmaker puts into things that seem, on the surface, as sweeping visual delight and spectacle. He’s put a lot of thought into each of the characters’ lives, and I love that.\n\nIn Venice, there’s a moment where Ethan says, “Your life will always matter more to me than my own,” and it cuts to Grace, who has tears in her eyes that are on the verge of falling. Did you play it as her being moved by Ethan’s words, or were the tears a residual effect of recent tragedy?\n\nAt the time, we did lots of variations where she’s still defiant and still unwilling to trust him. She’s coming into this world where she would have to give up the independence that she has not only enjoyed, but also depended on to survive. And so I knew that would be a very emotionally conflicting moment for her. In retrospect, where we ended up taking it is that deep down, whether she’s aware of it or not, that’s something she’s always wanted to hear from another human being. It’s the idea that someone else has got her back, without an agenda. She says, “You don’t even know me,” so she’s definitely not earned that from him by that point at all. But deep down, she really wants that relief of having someone look out for her.\n\nAlso, the cost now of caring about another human being and being cared for is a lot for her to take, because the cost of caring and trusting someone for the first time means the risk of losing that person or being betrayed by them. So, in that moment, she’s just on the verge of really wanting to believe that it’s real, because it’s something that she’s always wanted. So when she says, “Promise me you’ll be on that train,” I feel like later it’s her going, “When you said your life wouldn’t be more to me than my own, I need you now to prove it.”\n\nSo, don’t get me wrong, you’ve had some amazing moments in Marvel movies, but I’ve honestly always felt like there was some untapped potential there, something McQ has now fulfilled in Mission. You’re as active as you’ve ever been and you show a wide range of your abilities. So do you feel like this is the centerstage moment you’ve been waiting for in a blockbuster film?\n\nYes. (Laughs.) On this level, yeah. I’ve had plays or productions that I’ve done in London, which, of course, is to a live audience, and so it’s not lived beyond the performance that night. It’s not immortalized on camera. But yeah, I feel this sense that I was finally given the trust and the platform to do lots of different things and to show more range and to show more emotional depth in a franchise or something of this size, which I hadn’t been afforded before. And so I have this eternal gratitude to Tom and to McQ, who saw it in me and provided the resources and the support system every day on set so that I could thrive. They are generous enough to let me try and find my own way through this, without pigeonholing her as one thing, and it feels like it’s been a deliverance of a long time coming. After 17 years in this industry, I’ve finally been able to do something at this level, with this quality of filmmaking, and I’d never been afforded that before.\n\nHayley Atwell and Esai Morales in Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One Courtesy of Paramount Pictures and Skydance\n\nAs AI and the ongoing attack against truth became more and more relevant this year, both issues served as real-life character development for your big bad, The Entity. So, what was the internal response to this real-life and real-time development of your villain?\n\nThe idea was brought very early on into production meetings, and my understanding of the story from the beginning was that it was this unquantifiable force that’s impossible to control. It knows us better than we know our own next move, and it’s faceless, ultimately. And I thought it was clever of [co-writers] Chris [McQuarrie] and Erik [Jendresen] to go, “Well, this makes for the perfect villain with global high stakes. It affects potentially every great power in the world.” So then it becomes a question of what do you do once you get that power? And the fight for that power in whoever possesses this key, they possess a different kind of global power that’s never been seen before, so that changes the trajectory of human beings. And then they grounded it in character, with a messenger of the Entity, played brilliantly by Esai Morales. He has such a charismatic, enigmatic presence on screen that’s chilling. To me, it spoke to the spreading of fake news, unregulated social media and the global powers at play that affect the lives of individuals and communities, and the potential repercussions of all those things. So I thought it felt very apt.\n\nAre you allowed to tease your experience shooting in the Arctic for Part Two?\n\nOnly insomuch as nothing has ever been filmed in the Arctic for a movie of this scale. People thought that it would be impossible, and luckily, Team Mission just came in and totally invalidated that belief system. I can say that the main focus was the safety of the cast and the crew, but also the respect of the landscape out there. The territory feels unowned in a way because it’s so majestic and raw. At times, in minus 55 with a wind chill, having to get action dialogue in that takes a tremendous amount of organization and focus. So how they put that together and weave that into the story, I don’t know, but it will remain the most extraordinary place I’ve ever been on this planet and will probably ever go.\n\nHayley Atwell and Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One Courtesy of Paramount Pictures and Skydance\n\nDecades from now, when you’re reminiscing in front of a crackling fireplace, what day on your Dead Reckoning Part One will you likely recall first?\n\n(Laughs.) It would be drifting in Rome with Tom in the passenger seat, handcuffed to me, with three cameras attached to the windscreen, which impaired my vision. And then it started to rain and the ground was getting wet, which obviously affected the drift. There were stunt cars, and we were beside these very old important monuments. People had come out to watch, and obviously, the crew was watching. I also had to work out whether Tom was speaking to Hayley or Ethan was talking to Grace, when he would say, “Slow down or take a left.” If it was Ethan talking to Grace, she can rebel against exactly what he’s saying and do the opposite. He would also come up with suggestions that he wanted me to try and say, and then we did it. So there’s about 20 minutes of footage of us doing it over and over again, and then stopping to get out and go, “Well, I hope we got some good stuff.”\n\n\n\nAnd then Tom led a round of applause from the crew, and McQ said, “Tom put his life in your hands just then and he wouldn’t have allowed you to do that had he not believed that you could look after him, too.” And I thought, “Wow, that’s generosity and trust from Tom and how hard he’s seen me work to make sure I can do this for him and for the movie.” It was a beautiful surprise to me, because I just thought, “Well, you told me to train really hard to be able to do it. So I did it.” It was a validation because they know what it takes technically, physically, mentally, emotionally to have done that and executed it well. So they’re never short on their praise for when actors come in and deliver for them. That’s a moment I’ll never forget.\n\n***\n\nMission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One is now playing in movie theaters. This interview was edited for length and clarity."

        "text": "China’s box office weekend was marked more by the tussle for top spot between “Never Say Never” and “Chang An” than the entry of “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One.” The Tom Cruise-starring U.S. blockbuster was the highest new release title, but landed in third place with an opening score of $25.9 million.\n\n\n\nThe weekend’s top-ranked film was “Never Say Never,” a holdover title that scored $46.1 million. Lightchaser Animation-produced “Chang An San Wan Li” (aka “Chang An 30,000 Miles”) earned a shade less, at $43.9 million, according to data from consultancy Artisan Gateway.\n\n\n\nAfter 11 days of official release (plus substantial previews), “Never Say Never,” written and directed by actor Wang Baoqiang (“Lost in Thailand,” “Detective Chinatown”) has already become one of the biggest hits of the year. Its cumulative stands at $212 million. “Chang An” has accumulated $96.1 million in nine days.\n\n\n\nLocal data providers’ daily charts showed that “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” never rose above third place despite a wide release on Friday. It played some 98,000 sessions on Friday, but exhibitors cut that on both successive days, ending at 53,000 on Sunday. (Imax reports that some $3.97 million of the film’s China total came from its screens.)\n\n\n\n“Never Say Never” also saw its screen count reduced as cinemas switched their real estate to support “Chang An,” despite the latter’s huge 168 -minute running time. “Chang An” enjoyed its best day on Sunday, its ninth day of release. The Tang Dynasty-set film mixes history and mythology and is touted as Lightchaser’s first from its New Culture series which are based on actual historical figures.\n\n\n\n“Mission Impossible” enjoyed the fourth largest opening haul for a Hollywood movie so far this year. The China launch of “Mission: Impossible” is on a par with “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3” ($28 million opening and a cumulative of $89 million) but behind “Fast X” (opening of $51.1 million and $146 million cumulative) and “Transformers – Rise of the Beasts” (opening $38.9 million and running total of $96 million).\n\n\n\nSmash hit, “Lost in the Stars” earned an additional $15.9 million as it fell to fourth place. It has now earned $474 million since June 22.\n\n\n\nAnother Chinese animation “Oh My School” took fifth place in its opening weekend with a $12.8 million. The picture is a body swap comedy involves a naughty pupil and a strict class teacher.\n\n\n\nThe weekend aggregate box office was a healthy $154 million, which propelled the year-to-date total to $4.36 billion. Artisan Gateway calculates that as being some 64% ahead of the same point last year, and only 9% behind that of 2019, the last pre-pandemic year."

        "text": "The testosterone soap opera known as the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise has never been such a welcome sight for its weary fanbase. Few action blockbusters outside of the superhero genre have landed with audiences recently, and in a summer that has seen a slunk in numbers at the box office, Tom Cruise may be just the antidote the industry needs. That doesn't mean that is a perfect installment. In this year's second big-budget, franchise two-parter - it's debatable if this film or left audiences on a higher cliff by film's end - \"Dead Reckoning Part One\" forgoes the sadistic evil mastermind or sociopath seeking utter chaos. Instead, the film makes a bargain with an artificial devil known as The Entity. That's right. Ethan Hunt must harness his greatest assets, use every trick in his chapter book, use every ounce of knowledge and street smarts he can muster, all to face off against... a computer.\n\nIf you're rolling your eyes, it's for good reason. Hunt, an accomplished, well-filmed action hero, has had his fair share of complicated foes. But The Entity, as it's called, will divide audiences more than ever. AI is what keeps most tech junkies up at night these days, and there is reason to believe that such advanced technology could pose a threat to humans one day, but it is certainly an uncinematic opponent, to say the least. Skynet was, at the very least, a figment of the future; the Matrix was born of a dystopian alternative reality. The Entity is operating in the present day, beeping and bopping its way onto all the snarky \"Worst Villains\" lists the internet will inevitably contrive one day. And for good reason. It's a smart chip locked away at the bottom of the ocean, conveniently inaccessible and only destructible with a specific key. It will hardly instill global hysteria. Gabriel (Esai Morales), a mysterious, sinister villain from Hunt's past, enters stage right as a fleshy foe to appease the audience's need for human evil, but even he can't completely distract from The Entity's sometimes hilarious showboating.\n\nTake, for instance, the scene in which Hunt learns exactly what The Entity is. He's crashed a Carnival-type party in Venice where a myriad of dancing guests wear masks and set a scene straight out of The party is hosted by the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), a carryover character known for her constant side-swapping and illegal dealings. The whole crew is gathered around: the White Widow, her entourage, Hunt, his trusty colleague Ilsa (Ferguson), a new acquaintance Grace (Hayley Atwell) whose stealthy pickpocket landed her in a hard drive of hot water (computer jokes really don't land the way you'd hope) and hovering nemesis Gabriel. As vague threats and intimidating glances course through the undercurrent of the dialogue, the final revelation allows a clear understanding: The Entity is everywhere, controlling everything, seeing everyone. It can compute every possible outcome and every imaginable scenario, outthinking and outwitting anyone attempting to stop it. The lights in the large, ancient venue turn an ominous green and flash to personify The Entity's possible evil cackle and to demonstrate its omnipresence.\n\n\n\nStrobe lights! Panning camera shots! The look of realization on Cruise's face as he is surrounded by his body-less nemesis! Muah ha ha ha! It's The Entity!\n\nIt is by and far the film's most laughable sequence and one of the few that feels forced, farcical and calculated, an attempt to instill fear in viewers that would otherwise remain at giga-arm's length. Luckily, \"Dead Reckoning Part One\" has two weapons against audience disbelief and general premise fatigue: Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie. The twosome have been frequent collaborators over the years, with McQuarrie joining the \"Mission: Impossible\" family as director in 2015's ,\" and even though it's been a minute since Cruise last hopped onto his motorcycle for 2018's ,\" they return to the silver screen like no time has passed.\n\nSpeaking of moving vehicles, this film is full of them. The chase sequence through Rome - no you are not imagining it, \"Fast X\" also had an epic car chase through the Eternal City - is particularly fun and demonstrates the physicality and comedic timing that both Cruise and Atwell have mastered in their respective careers. You likely know Cruise's long filmography, but Atwell also has experience in big action flicks, having led a Marvel television series and starred in numerous MCU films as Captain America's significant other and government agent, Peggy Carter. McQuarrie knows how to write an entertaining, outrageous movie that may not have roots in reality, but that carries viewers happily through a saga that won't end (yet). Thankfully, it also doesn't slog like some other recent releases in the genre that have also pushed toward a 3-hour runtime.\n\n\n\nThe Entity won't keep viewers up at night, but the film is wound together by the chemistry between Cruise and his supporting troupe, including longtime castmates Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames and Ferguson, as well as newbie Atwell, whose wise-cracking, emotive performance steals the show. If you can let your inhibitions go out the moving train - yes, there is another moving train and rooftop battle sequence - then \"Dead Reckoning Part One\" will delight. Hunt and crew jetset around the globe, avoiding authorities, sticking the middle finger at government players and, of course, employing hyper-realistic masks, high-tech gadgets and the formidable stunt work that put \"Mission: Impossible\" on the map back in 1996.\n\n\"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\" is in theaters now."

        "text": "Paramount’s “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” is defusing a bit at the domestic box office, readjusting for an estimated $78 million gross over its five-day opening. That’d be a substantial chunk behind projections headed into the weekend, which had the Tom Cruise action sequel hoping for $90 million.\n\nSome in the industry were expecting a “Top Gun: Maverick” halo effect for “Dead Reckoning” after last year’s legacy sequel positively ignited movie theaters, rocketing through the summer to become the fifth-highest grossing domestic release of all-time. That doesn’t seem to be the case though, as “Mission” isn’t exactly transcending the numbers typical for its franchise.\n\nThe last entry, 2018’s “Fallout,” launched with a then-franchise record $61 million over three days. “Dead Reckoning” opened on Wednesday, plus previews on Tuesday evening — a bump-up in the calendar that the industry suspects was implemented to take advantage of premium ticket prices for Imax. Universal and director Christopher Nolan take over those auditoriums next weekend with their sweeping historical drama “Oppenheimer.”\n\nTom Cruise may have fostered a reputation as the global vanguard for movie theaters over the past few years — “I love my popcorn,” he declared in a new video this week — but it’s worth a reminder that his films aren’t the biggest openers on the block. Instead, they tend to draw older audiences, who are less inclined to roll out for a new release in the first few days. “Top Gun: Maverick” is the star’s superlative multiplier, taking its $126 million three-day debut to a $718 million finish, but “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” more than tripled its opening weekend, as did the 2015 entry “Rogue Nation.”\n\nAs “Dead Reckoning” falls behind opening estimates, the franchise will need to find those kinds of legs again. This seventh franchise entry is the most expensive yet — with a production budget that ballooned to $290 million, not only due to its high-octane set pieces but also a series of COVID-related production delays and safety measures. (“We are the gold standard!” Cruise shouted at crew members he caught breaking protocols in 2020.) That’s more than $100 million higher than the price tag for “Fallout.”\n\nStrong word-of-mouth should be helpful. The “Mission” series is now a favorite among critics for its daredevil stunts, intricate set pieces and wry humor. Variety chief film critic Peter Debruge filed a rave for “Dead Reckoning,” writing that it “delivers a formidable concept and several hall-of-fame set-pieces while somehow managing to tie the storylines back into these movies’ core mythology.” He’s far from an outlier, as the film stands with a 92% approval rating from top critics on review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences are also exhilarated, as indicated by the “A” Cinema Score grade determined by surveying ticket buyers.\n\n“Mission: Impossible” will also look to register strongly overseas, where the franchise has become a strong draw. Both “Fallout” and “Rogue Nation” earned more than 70% of their ticket sales in foreign markets. So far, “Dead Reckoning” has earned $82.1 million across 70 international territories through its first three days of release.\n\n“Dead Reckoning” sees Tom Cruise back as secret agent Ethan Hunt, recruiting his crew of super-spies to take on a very scary and very topical enemy: an all-powerful artificial intelligence called the Entity. Christopher McQuarrie returns to direct after helming the last two entries. Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby and Henry Czerny make series returns, while newcomers Hayley Atwell, Esai Morales, Pom Klementieff, Cary Elwes and Rob Delaney join the fray.\n\nEven with Cruise driving motorcycles off cliffs and chasing criminals around Europe, there is perhaps a more remarkable box office narrative continuing to unfold this weekend. Angel Studios’ “Sound of Freedom” continues to show strength as a bona fide word-of-mouth monster. Major studios are projecting a $23 million haul through the weekend — which would mark a sizable 17% uptick from its gross last weekend.\n\nWide releases hardly ever see week-to-week rises in ticket sales, but “Sound of Freedom” isn’t a typical wide release. After being shelved by Disney during the shuffle of the 21st Century Fox acquisition, the Jim Caviezel thriller was eventually taken on by Angel Studios. The Utah-based banner has employed a “Pay It Forward” system, encouraging viewers to donate money to the company so that it can purchase and distribute tickets to other prospective audience members looking to see the film at no cost. But a release doesn’t go up in ticket sales just based on an untraditional system — with its glowing “A+” grade on Cinema Score and lots of chatter on social media, “Sound of Freedom” is a phenomenon, particularly among conservative audiences.\n\nThe film, which has been scrutinized by anti-trafficking experts, tells the story of real-life ex-fed Tim Ballard, who left the government to take on human trafficking through his own means. Ballard founded the non-profit Operation Underground Railroad, though he has reportedly parted ways with the organization more recently.\n\nSony’s “Insidious: The Red Door” looks to take third place, projecting a $12.6 million haul through Sunday. That would mark a sizable 62% tumble from its opening last weekend, when the horror sequel debuted on top of domestic charts. The Screen Gems, Stage 6 Films and Blumhouse co-production carries a modest $17 million production budget — a figure that its $54 million domestic gross has already far surpassed.\n\n“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” is facing a 59%-or-so drop in its third weekend. The Harrison Ford finale added $3.3 million on Friday, pushing its domestic total to $136 million. The Disney release will soon surpass “Fast X” ($145 million) to become one of the top 10 domestic releases of the year; it’d be more remarkable if it weren’t for the film’s whopping $300 million production budget.\n\nDisney also looks to round out the top five with the Pixar romance “Elemental.” The animated feature added $2.6 million on Friday, stretching its domestic haul to $119 million. “Elemental” bombed upon release, landing Pixar’s lowest opening in history ($29 million), but it has held remarkably well in the weeks since, continuing to draw family crowds. While it won’t recoup its $200 million production budget in North America, things seemed far bleaker just a few weeks ago.\n\nOpening in limited release, Disney is putting out the ensemble comedy “Theater Camp” out under its Searchlight Pictures banner. The indie release, starring Molly Gordon and Ben Platt, looks to capitalize on strong notices out of the Sundance Film Festival. The film is opening in six theaters in Los Angeles and New York, earning $109,000 on Friday."

        "text": "SPOILER ALERT: This story discusses the ending of “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” currently playing in theaters.\n\n“Dead Reckoning,” the seventh installment of the “Mission: Impossible” franchise, is the latest Hollywood blockbuster to be split into two movies, but Tom Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie tried their hardest to give “Part One” a non-cliffhanger conclusion. The filmmaker recently told Total Film magazine that thinking about how to conclude the first of two movies kept Cruise up at night during the filming of “Part One.”\n\nMore from Variety\n\n“Where we ended the movie was always where we were going to end it,” McQuarrie said of the train action sequence. “How we ended the movie was a big, big mystery for us. It kept Tom awake at night throughout production. He would come in all the time and say, ‘This can’t be a cliffhanger, it’s got to be satisfying.’ The audience has to feel a sense of completion.”\n\nMcQuarrie continued, “Tom kept looking at that scene, and he had all this anxiety about whether or not it would be a satisfying conclusion or whether it would feel open-ended. We constantly revisited it, constantly refined it.”\n\nUnlike “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” which threw moviegoers a curveball by ending on a massive cliffhanger (its second part, “Beyond the Spider-Verse,” arrives in March 2024), “Dead Reckoning Part One” ends with Cruise’s Ethan Hunt achieving his immediate goal (he secures the key to unlock the source code of The Entity, the film’s villainous AI program) and Hayley Atwell’s Grace accepting an offer to join the IMF. There are dangling plot threads for “Part Two” to pick up (chief among them being that the film’s human villain, Esai Morales’ Gabriel, is still alive), but at least one mission has reached its definitive end. This is a far more conclusive ending than “Spider-Verse,” which leaves viewers hanging as Miles Morales is stuck in an alternate universe with the Prowler-version of himself.\n\nStory continues\n\n“If you leave it with a cliffhanger, it feels a little bit like we’re expecting you to come back,” McQuarrie told Total Film. “We didn’t want that feeling. The feeling we were reaching for — and we hope you feel — is we dare you not to come back. We want to leave you thinking, ‘Oh, I can’t wait to see what happens next.'”\n\n“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” is now playing theaters nationwide from Paramount Pictures. “Part Two” is set to open on June 28, 2024.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nSign up for Variety’s Newsletter.

        "text": "This interview took place before SAG-AFTRA strike activity.\n\nWhile villains typically tend to be unanimously reviled characters — from Scar and Pennywise to Hannibal Lecter — the best actors find a way to make even the worst bad guys likable. In the seventh installment of Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible series (Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One, currently in theaters), Pom Klementieff plays the fiery Paris, whose sole directive is to sabotage everybody else’s efforts (by all means necessary — and we mean all means) to retrieve a key that unlocks an all-powerful artificial intelligence nicknamed \"The Entity.\"\n\nAnd yet, the audience can’t help but fall in love with the rambunctious French firecracker, whose grunge-inspired outfits, platinum bob haircut, and intricate fight sequences make her the film’s resident cool girl.\n\n“She's on a path of destruction and you're still rooting for her, like, ‘I love this girl,’” Klementieff tells InStyle about her character, a Harley Quinn type who drops roundhouse kicks in plaid miniskirts and runs a military-grade tank through the tourist-filled streets of Venice, Italy, with a maniacal smile on her face. Her character is a woman of few words, relying on action and fashion to speak for her, which Klementieff calls “freeing, because it was just all about behavior and all about just movement.”\n\nShe also says she drew inspiration from iconic silent characters of the past, played by some of the greats like Clint Eastwood, Japanese comedian Takeshi Kitano, and French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo.\n\n“But the beauty of it is that when she speaks, everyone listens,” she adds.\n\nKlementieff is no stranger to the genre, with a stacked résumé that includes high-action projects like Thunder Force (starring Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer) and Guardians of the Galaxy. Although Paris is a far cry from her beloved Marvel character Mantis, likability is something Klementieff excels at bringing to her characters both good and bad. She also appeared as Haeng-Bok in Spike Lee's 2013 mystery Old Boy alongside Josh Brolin, Elizabeth Olsen, Samuel L. Jackson, and Michael Imperioli.\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nThe latest installment of the wildly popular franchise — which also marks the series’s second-to-last volume (Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part 2 is slated to hit theaters next summer) — delivers all the makings of the espionage franchise that loyal fans have come to know and love: action-packed scenes, over-the-top fight sequences, and the thrill of taking on things that are, well, impossible.\n\n“It was such an honor to join this franchise,” Klementieff gushes. “I've been a fan since I was a child, so I saw all the other movies so many times. It was just incredible to get to work on this movie and to work with Tom and McQ [director Christopher McQuarrie].”\n\nBut this film is also sure to draw in a whole new generation with its reinvented approach to the spy movie, which weaves together modern technological advancements (we’re talking an AI entity that has the world’s superpowers clamoring for control), moments of comedic relief, a whirlwind romance, and a set of new characters, like Paris and Grace (played by fellow Marvel alumnae Hayley Atwell). Even moviegoers who aren’t die-hard Mission: Impossible fans can prepare to be captivated for the film’s entire 2 hour and 43 minute run, which seems long, but is stacked with exciting content from start to finish. In other words, it’s quite literally a movie that feels like a real movie (thank you, Harry Styles, for these profound words) and deserves to be experienced in theaters.\n\n“There's some lightness to it and there's drama. Sometimes it's rom-com, sometimes it's film noir. It's so many things at the same time,” Klementieff says, explaining the film’s diverse landscape. “I think this movie is so rich, it feels like several movies at the same time in several genres at the same time. There's also some very charming and funny moments, right? With Ethan [Cruise] and Grace. as well, you see a comedy that you haven't seen in the previous movies.”\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nUnlike the majority of action movies, M:I 7 taps into current style trends for costuming (something for the fashion girlies) — especially when it comes to Paris and her punk-rock aesthetic. Klementieff worked with the movie’s costume designer, Jill Taylor, to develop something “fresh and different” for the rebellious character while also keeping her “grounded” during her intense action sequences.\n\n“We're going to bring something different for this character, some vibe that was a little bit more punk, which is cool to do, because I think it was really different from the other female characters from the franchise,” she says. “What was very important to me is that she was not wearing heels because she knows she's going to fight, so wearing heels just doesn't make sense.”\n\nDuring one scene, Paris, along with everyone else searching for the coveted key, attends a party at a nightclub in Venice. Paris’s makeup look, which included a drawn-on white mask with a black teardrop, was influenced by the 17th century pantomime staple Pierrot from the commedia dell'arte.\n\n“It's kind of cute but creepy at the same time,” she said describing Paris’s less-than-incognito ensemble. “[There’s] something melancholic about the teardrop that really connected with the character, that made sense.”\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nKlementieff admits that her style IRL isn’t that entirely different from her latest on-screen persona. ”My style is eclectic and it depends on the mood, but for everyday, of course it's going to be more relaxed and more chill. But, for events I like to have fun and just take risks.”\n\nThe actress arrived at the movie’s Seoul, South Korea, premiere in a head-turning strapless leather gown made from motorcycle gear (found by her stylist Jonathan Huguet), which she paired with platform boots and a slicked-back hairdo that included nail embellishments, executed by her hairstylist Marcia Lee.\n\n“It's fun to do things that are unexpected, go from one vibe to another, and not take it too seriously,” she says. “Life is short and you want to have a good time too, so I do that with fashion, as well.”\n\nMission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part 1 is in theaters now."

Get this, Warners also led that month as well with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 which made $318.5M of its $381M gross during July back then.\n\nThis July was so great, it was +20% over last July’s $1.14 billion and +6% from pre-pandemic 2019 which minted $1.29 billion.\n\n“July was incredible for people who love going to the movies in cinemas with friends and family,” said NATO’s President and CEO Michael O’Leary in statement.\n\n“This month now ranks as one of the top-performing Julys in the history of motion pictures,” he continued, “Consumer enthusiasm and excitement continues to grow as our partners in the creative community and at the studios continue to release a steady stream of compelling and entertaining movies across multiple genres, while theater owners take showmanship to the next level.\n\nAs we also told you, this past weekend’s domestic haul of $217M for all movies was a record for the final session of July.\n\n“This past weekend is also further evidence that the economic impact of high-quality movies cannot be measured simply by the opening weekend box office,” O’Leary added.\n\n“Most importantly, July highlights the special bond between the American public and movie theatres and the unique cultural moments they create that cannot be replicated elsewhere,” said the new NATO Boss.\n\nShaping out the rest of the top ten pics of July for the period of July 1-31: 3.) Angel Studios’ relentless Sound of Freedom ($151.3M), 4) Disney/Lucasfilm’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny ($143.9M), 5) Paramount/Skydance’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning – Part One ($140.4M), 6) Sony/Blumhouse’s Insidious: The Red Door ($78.5M), 7) Disney/Pixar’s Elemental ($64.6M), 8) Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse ($47.1), 9) Disney’s Haunted Mansion ($26.4M) and 10) Sony’s No Hard Feelings ($26.1M).\n\nWith the SAG-AFTRA strike already pushing big movies like Kraven the Hunter, Challengers and the next Ghostbusters out of 2023, and exhibition fearing a downturn at the B.O. come October should the actors’ sit-out continue, the guild’s National Executive Director and Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland told Deadline yesterday that despite that harsh impact, “we have to take a strong line.”\n\nWhile a supporter of exhibition, Crabtree-Ireland acknowledged that the sector is “obviously very challenged” however “we can’t allow theatrical exhibition to become a way that the studios are sort of fueling their businesses during our strike.”"

        "text": "Warning: This article contains spoilers for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One.\n\nThe most shocking event which occurs in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is arguably not the sight of Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt riding a motorbike off a cliff, but rather the death of Hunt's friend and fellow spy Ilsa Faust, a major part of the franchise since 2015's Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation. Portrayed by Rebecca Ferguson, Faust is killed on a Venice bridge by Esai Morales' villainous Gabriel while Hunt runs (of course!) through the Italian city, arriving too late to help her.\n\nIn a new podcast interview with Empire, the film's director and co-writer Christopher McQuarrie discusses why he and Cruise, who produced the movie with McQuarrie, felt the need to kill off Ferguson's character.\n\nRebecca Ferguson in 'Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One'. Paramount Pictures and Skydance\n\n\"It was one of the earliest conversations. We were on the set of Top Gun, we were already talking about it,\" says the filmmaker, referring to last year's Joseph Kosinski-directed Top Gun: Maverick, which McQuarrie co-wrote. \"We knew that that emotional arc was of a certain emotional tone... Ilsa is a wonderful character, and a character of which I am enormously proud, and Rebecca is an actor of such unmitigated power and presence.\"\n\nHe continued, \"And yet, where we had gone with the character from Rogue to Fallout...[the] place you took that character would either make less of her, it would suddenly become frivolous... or she would just become a romantic interest, and it was never about creating a character who was defined by her love story with Ethan Hunt. Their relationship transcends a traditional loving story... They're doomed to be together and yet doomed never to be together... It felt like that story was looking for its resolution and so we said this has got to happen.\"\n\nMcQuarrie goes on to explain that his and Cruise's decision to conclude Faust's story dovetailed with their desire to give a sense of genuine stakes to the movie.\n\n\"What really needs to happen in the story is the stakes have to be real, they can't be implied,\" says the director. \"We have to have the courage to let [Ethan] fail and it has to cost, the mission has to cost, and without that, the villain simply will not have a threat…what you're seeing in the escalation of the story is what it costs Ethan personally in Venice.\"\n\nWhen asked if the pair had considered the possibility of killing off Simon Pegg's Benji Dunn or Ving Rhames' Luther Stickell, the director said \"we explored them all\" before ominously pointing out that the recent film is, after all, just Part One of the tale.\n\nWant more movie news?

        "text": "It’s 10 a.m. in Sydney, where Hayley Atwell is preparing to walk the red carpet as the “Mission: Impossible” crew’s newest member, joining producer and star Tom Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie’s ensemble of battle-hardened actors.\n\n“This is a pure cinematic experience. It’s unadulterated entertainment, and of a huge scale,” Atwell says to Variety about “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” which finally hit theaters on July 12 following a two-year delay caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFlashy events like the Australia premiere (which featured a fireworks spectacle in honor of Cruise’s 61st birthday on July 3) mark the end of a four-year odyssey that pushed Atwell’s limits physically — leaving her hanging inside a train car that’s gone from horizontal to vertical, gripping anything nailed to the floor/wall/ceiling lest she fall to her death (or at least the safety rigging below) — and saw her creating a cunning character within the “M:I” universe.\n\n“I’m aware that this is entertainment,” Atwell adds. “But I’m also aware that my responsibility as an actor is to contribute in my own small way to the kind of characters I want to see represented.”\n\nAtwell plays Grace, a professional thief who becomes embroiled in Ethan Hunt’s (Cruise) latest impossible mission — tracking down a rogue artificial intelligence system. Among its various plotlines, “Dead Reckoning Part One” chronicles Grace’s origins, explaining how the pickpocket becomes an integral part of the narrative.\n\nShe’s seen the movie four times, the first at a screening for the cast and crew, with her mother as her plus one (and Cruise watching her mum instead of the screen to gauge her enjoyment.) So, what did mum make of the movie?\n\n“She’s very vocal and effusive when it comes to the big action sequences. She’s like, ‘Oh my God, why didn’t you tell me you’re doing that?’” says Atwell, who quipped: “Because you would have been really nervous for me.”\n\nThe death-defying stunt work aside, Atwell’s mother also shared a poignant takeaway. “She recognizes the grounding that I’ve done with Grace, of giving her emotional depth,” Atwell shares. “She could see that I was able to hold my own with my own experience of being in this industry and bringing truth to the role.”\n\nTom Cruise and Hayley Atwell in “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.” Paramount Pictures and Skydance\n\nThe British American actor joins the IMF from the MCU, where she played Margaret “Peggy” Carter for more than a decade. Over the course of six movies and the ABC series “Agent Carter,” Peggy rose through the ranks to lead the government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. — challenging misogyny in the workplace with the same verve she nabbed supervillains. Plus, Peggy represents one half of the multiverse’s most enduring romance, as the first love of Steve Rogers a.k.a. Captain America (Chris Evans).\n\nThere’s really no comparison between Marvel and “Mission,” Atwell says. It’s really apples and oranges — or more specifically akin to performing Kenneth Lonergan’s adaptation of “Howards End” versus starring in Henrik Ibsen’s “Rosmersholm” on the West End.\n\n“They’re just so distinctively themselves — a different group of filmmakers, different tastes, different character, different worlds,” she explains. “They just happen to be things that have become global phenomena.”\n\nYet there’s a bridge that carries Atwell from one franchise to the other: the way she personified both women.\n\n“What I tried to do with Peggy — and I think it’s the reason I got the part in ‘Mission’ — I didn’t play her like I was in a superhero film. And with Grace, I’m not playing her like I’m in an action film,” Atwell notes. “Peggy taught me that I can be distinctively grounded in a character that’s going to stand out, rather than get consumed by the machine of something.”\n\nA “Mission” movie is not your typical Hollywood machine. For starters, there’s no set script, so Atwell developed Grace from the ground up alongside Cruise and McQuarrie. “I didn’t feel like I was having to fit into a character that they’d created,” she explains, “because they hadn’t actually created one.”\n\nEach scene offered an opportunity to add nuance and subvert any action movie stereotypes about “strong” women. “I thought, well, it’s an opportunity here to do many different takes” on the character, Atwell says. “I didn’t want her to seem that she was just trying to look cool, or femme fatale, or a sex object.”\n\nShe sees Grace’s motivation as one driven by some deep wound that’s caused the character to be distrustful of others and retreat from society. “Something’s got to have happened to her to interrupt the very deep human need that we all have to belong — whether it’s to our family, our social group, or some sort of tribe, or workforce that gives us a sense of identity,” she reasons, pinpointing why Grace can be “unpredictable, untrustworthy and inconsistent.”\n\nIn a recent interview with The Telegraph, Atwell revealed that at age 13 she wrote letters to her 40-year-old self — Atwell is 41 — questioning what her life would be like. She shared that teenage Hayley would’ve been thrilled to learn she’d booked a “M:I” movie. But the teen would’ve had a big question: “Were you able to push the conversation forward about female representation in a franchise of this size?’”\n\nThe answer to that query is “Yes,” Atwell tells Variety, explaining that the mission she undertook with Grace was “to allow her and give her the platform to be more than one thing.”\n\n“Dead Reckoning” features an abundance of female characters: Rebecca Ferguson plays Ilsa Faust, a former MI6 agent turned IMF ally; Vanessa Kirby as black-market arms dealer Alanna Mitsopolis, a.k.a the White Widow; and fellow franchise-newcomer Pom Klementieff as the sociopathic assassin Paris.\n\n“All the characters are so distinctive, and that’s what’s great,” Atwell says. “They’re never all one thing — they all come in with their own agendas and their own ideas about who they are and what they want to be and what they want to do to affect people in the scene. Any one of them could have a spin-off and collectively, too.”\n\nIt’s striking to see all four share the screen in one particularly tense scene — further demonstrating that their roles are additive, not competitive.\n\n“Women in this franchise aren’t pitted against each other,” Atwell notes, adding that, “It’s a false assumption that that’s how it has to be, and probably more to do with a comment on the culture of celebrity that does seem to pit women against each other in a ‘Who wore it best?’ situation. But that mindset is not a creative act.”\n\nHayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, Vanessa Kirby and Christopher McQuarrie on the set of “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One.” Christian Black\n\nOn the topic of female representation, Atwell often recalls a line from art critic John Berger’s “Ways of Seeing”: “Men act, and women appear. Men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at.” Those words, Atwell says, have been true to her experience as an actor, and what she believes to be true for many women in the public eye. She wanted “Mission” to be different.\n\n“I don’t want to feel that Grace is aware that she’s being looked at. I want to see what Grace is looking at,” Atwell says. “She’s in a world that’s over her head, but she’s in a hypervigilant state of trying to work out how to navigate it, and how to survive through it.”\n\nThus, Grace employs her sense of humor and other tactics like flirtation to get where she needs to go. “She can duck, dive and disappear, or she can call Ethan Hunt a ‘pervert’ publicly in order to escape him,” Atwell says, giggling at the character’s cheekiness in one key moment.\n\nAnd since physical prowess is a prerequisite for the franchise, Atwell also underwent five months of stunt training, so she was ready to improvise whenever a scene required it. She experimented with different disciplines of mixed martial arts, worked on sleight of hand tricks and pickpocketing (the latter which she’s “terrible” at because she’s “an awful liar”) and learned to drift in a race car.\n\nOne day, while training, stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood handed her two knives to hold while practicing a trapping and grappling sequence. Turns out, Atwell could do her moves faster with the addition of the prop weapons.\n\n“I think it comes from theater – I love working with props on a stage because you can convey so much and they’re an extension of your character,” she says, letting her inner theater nerd geek out. “The way that you stir a cup of tea can tell how much you hate someone you’re talking to, or that you’re trying to seduce them.”\n\nTraining for a “M:I” movie is like a boot camp, but it’s not about the aesthetics. It’s about building a different kind of strength and Hayley has the bruises to prove it. “At the time that I came to set, my body was fit for purpose,” Atwell says.\n\nPart of that purpose was developing the shorthand between herself and Cruise so that Grace and Ethan could create an “elegant physicality” when handcuffed together. The duo also brushed up on their classic cinema, watching 70s heist movies like “Paper Moon” and “The Sting,” as well as “The Thomas Crown Affair,” “To Catch a Thief” and “Bringing Up Baby” to build a library of references to pull from tonally.\n\nHayley Atwell and Tom Cruise in “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning – Part One” Christian Black\n\n“When they’re sort of do-si-doing around the car with each other, there is this sense that these two people who are exasperated by each other share an origin story and are naturally working together whether they realize it or not,” Atwell explains.\n\nDuring the car chase scene, Atwell was not only tasked with drifting the car while handcuffed to Cruise, but also taking performance notes from McQuarrie about adjusting Grace’s reaction to the circumstances. Add onto that the reality of filming with a swarm of fans and paparazzi watching the production speed through the streets. Here, her theater training again paid dividends.\n\n“Live performance is a huge tool for a movie like ‘Mission,’ because when the curtain goes up, you can’t get a retake, and the audience are going to be there to watch if you fall flat on your face, or your downward inflections bore the audience to tears,” she explains. “You get feedback by picking up the atmosphere that that you’re helping to create in that auditorium.”\n\nAtwell compares the atmosphere on set to becoming the eye of the storm, with Cruise leading the charge by maintaining his composure at its absolute center and her following suit. “You’re very calm in the midst of all this noise and stimulation and equipment and changes and locations, and COVID and paparazzi, and journalists and all that stuff,” she says.\n\nThe Rome chase takes place in two vehicles — a BMW M5 and a Fiat 500, affectionately nicknamed “Trixie,” for the way the tiny automobile whipped through the Italian streets and accidentally bamboozled Cruise.\n\n“She had sort of a character of herself, which added so much kind of levity to it,” Atwell says of the automobile. “When you see Ethan finally being able to turn it on, and then immediately crash the car — that was real. That hadn’t been intended, and then we used it.”\n\nTom Cruise and Hayley Atwell in “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” Paramount Pictures and Skydance\n\nEmbracing those kinds of spontaneous moments are what made production fun. “The plot tends to be a metaphor for the making of a ‘Mission: Impossible’ film,” she explains. “McQ and Tom just go, ‘OK, well, this is what we’ve got today, so let’s actually find a way to use it for the movie.’”\n\nAnd the idea of borrowing from reality works both ways. You see, when you’re so deeply immersed in a character for the length of time a “M:I” movie takes to make, it stands to reason that some of the skills will transfer. In Atwell’s case, it’s the driving, and now, her fiancé, music producer Ned “Wolfgang” Kelly really doesn’t like riding in the car with her.\n\n“He’s like, ‘Please slow down. It’s quite erratic,’” Atwell says, laughing loudly at a memory of her panicked passenger’s reminder that she’s not in an action film. It’s just that the feeling of your adrenaline rising when you’re behind the wheel can be a little addictive. “It does sort of rub off on you,” she adds. “I have to rein it in a little bit and go, ‘I’m just going to the shop.’”\n\nThe training also paid off when Atwell returned to Marvel in 2022’s “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” for an action-packed cameo as Captain Carter. “Because I was so fit at that point, and I’d had such an education about how to move anatomically correctly and making sure that I was safe to do it, I wanted to do all the fighting,” she says. “I wanted it to go on much longer than it did.”\n\nWith “Mission,” her “scariest” stunt was the train sequence; it took nearly a year to complete because each car had to be built and filmed separately, with Atwell and Cruise shooting and re-shooting portions of the sequence to find the right tone.\n\n“I’d see on the call sheet a year later that we’re going to spend the afternoon on that vertical train carriage again and be like, ‘Oh God, no, I’m so tired from that,’” she says. “So when you see Ethan going, ‘Do you trust me?’ and Grace just shakes her head — that’s me going, ‘Not anymore. I don’t want to do this anymore. It’s really scary.’ They loved it. They were like, ‘That’s going in.’”\n\nAtwell notes that Cruise, too, gets a case of the nerves when risking his life for stunts. “Tom says it’s not that he doesn’t get nervous and scared, but that fear is OK for him. He accepts the feeling,” she says. “They don’t stop him from doing what he wants or needs to do.”\n\nAs for Atwell’s next mission — that’s territory unknown. “One thing at a time,” she says with a bright laugh, noting that “Dead Reckoning Part Two” is barely two-thirds through its shoot. “Jet lag is telling me the thing I want next is a little nap.”\n\nJordan Moreau contributed to this report."

        "text": "In July, Tom Cruise‘s latest foray as Ethan Hunt, “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” crashed into movie theaters like a runaway train, taking advantage of the fact it could get premium formats before the unstoppable “Barbenheimer” was unleashed.\n\nMuch of the narrative following “Dead Reckoning’s” opening weekend of $54.7 million is that it wasn’t performing up to spec, though one has to remember that it made another $23.8 million before the weekend for a five-day opening of $78.5 million. Although the weekend part was lower than the $61.2 million the previous “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” opened with in 2018, it was more than every previous “Mission: Impossible” movie.\n\nMore from GoldDerby\n\nSEE Grab the popcorn and sound off in our movie forums\n\nThe problem that “Dead Reckoning” knew it was going to face was the combination of Greta Gerwig‘s “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan‘s “Oppenheimer,” which were always going to grab all the screens (particular IMAX) just a week after it opened. Almost no one saw the real-life drama “Sound of Freedom” coming out of nowhere and making so much money either.\n\n“Dead Reckoning” received similar rave reviews as “Fallout” and a great “A” CinemaScore, but the summer can be a particularly busy time with many movies demanding screens. A force like “Barbenheimer” is something so rare that not even Cruise could have expected the impact it might have on the latest “Mission: Impossible” installment.\n\nSEE 2023 box office hits: Every movie that made more than $100 million\n\nHere’s an overview of the whole franchise, which has now been going on for 27 years:\n\n2023 – “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One”\n\nOpening: $54.7 million; Domestic Gross: $154.1 million\n\n2018 – “Mission: Impossible – Fallout”\n\nOpening: $61.2 million; Domestic Gross: $220.2 million\n\n2015 – “Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation”\n\nOpening: $55.5 million; Domestic Gross: $195 million\n\n2011 – “Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol”\n\nOpening: $12.8 million (IMAX only); Domestic Gross: $209.4 million\n\n2006 – “Mission: Impossible III”\n\nOpening: $47.7 million; Domestic Gross: $133.5 million\n\n2000 – “Mission: Impossible 2”\n\nOpening: $57.8 million; Domestic Gross: $215.4 million\n\n1996 – “Mission: Impossible”\n\nOpening: $45.4 million; Domestic Gross: $181 million\n\nIn general, the franchise has had quite a few highs and lows and “Dead Reckoning Part One” is still faring better than 2006’s “Mission: Impossible III,” a notable misfire for the franchise that may have suffered from Cruise’s private life exploits that was overshadowing his work as an actor during that period. 2011’s “Ghost Protocol,” directed by Brad Bird (“The Incredibles”), took a different approach by being released in over 450 IMAX theaters before expanding wider, and it also was released in December that year, so it was able to get a nice bump from the holidays. (It was also arguably one of the best movies in the franchise until “Fallout.”)\n\nSEEBox office preview: ‘The Last Voyage of the Demeter’ and ‘Jules’ will battle against ‘Barbenheimer’\n\nThe problem is that the latest installment isn’t getting any of the theaters it has lost since opening back as “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” hold strong and even gain theaters, so it might not even catch up to the original movie’s $181 million, which doesn’t account for over 25 years of ticket price inflation.\n\nSo what can Paramount do to make sure next year’s “Dead Reckoning Part Two” doesn’t follow a similar path as “The Matrix Revolutions” in 2003 or 2015’s “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2,” which ended their respective franchises on a low note. “The Matrix” did try to revive the franchise with 2021’s “The Matrix Resurrections,” which was anything but, and this November, the prequel “The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbird & Snakes” will try to see if that franchise can be revived without any of the original cast.\n\nThe ongoing writers’ and actors’ strikes makes it difficult to know if director Christopher McQuarrie and his team might be able to get “Dead Reckoning Part Two” finished sooner, maybe to strike while the iron is still hot or take advantage of the bump in business that movies get over the holidays, a la “Ghost Protocol.”\n\nSIGN UP for Gold Derby’s free newsletter with latest predictions\n\nBest of GoldDerby\n\nSign up for Gold Derby's Newsletter.

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nDidn't Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One just drop in theaters? Yes, it premiered on July 12th, but don't be surprised that the 4K Blu-ray pre-order is already available. The current trend with many of the big new film releases is for the theater and Blu-ray launches to occur simultaneously, presumably so you can get your pre-order in while the joy of watching the film is still fresh in your mind. That said, it seems as though the latest installment will be another big hit for star Tom Cruise, so if you're a fan of the franchise and enjoy his latest death-defying Mission: Impossible outing, details about the Blu-ray release can be found below.\n\nAt the time of writing pre-orders for the DVD, Blu-ray, and standard 4K Blu-ray release of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One are available here at Walmart and here on Amazon. You can also find the special edition 4K SteelBook release here at Walmart and here on Amazon. A release date and special features haven't been announced this early in the game, but this article will be updated with that information when it becomes available. Additional retailer exclusive Blu-rays are also likely, and they will be added at launch as well.\n\n\"For a series that has struggled with finding its footing while somehow tumbling upwards, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One could possibly, finally be establishing a long-form narrative,\" critic Patrick Cavanaugh wrote in ComicBook's review. \"While it's billed as a 'Part One,' we're given enough of a resolution to one McGuffin to feel like we were given a complete adventure, as well as knowing full well that there's a lot more to come. After nearly three decades and half a dozen outings, we might finally have real stakes and consequences that will stick with the franchise in perpetuity, possibly implying that anything that happens in this movie finally has an emotional impact on Ethan Hunt (Cruise).\"\n\nWhy Dead Reckoning Is Split in Two Parts\n\nDuring a recent interview with Collider, McQuarrie explained why he opted to split the Dead Reckoning story between two different films.\n\n\"Well, we knew with Fallout. Fallout really grew because of all the character and emotion we were putting into the story, all the things that we had discovered in Rogue Nation that was so unexpected,\" McQuarrie shared. \"I knew I wanted to expand the cast, and I knew I wanted to give each one of those characters more to do, so I knew the movie was going to be bigger and longer than Fallout.\"\n\n\"And at which point I said, 'Why are we fighting this? Why are we going to try to jam this into two hours? Let's just break it in half and make it two movies.' That really was the rationale behind it being a two-part movie. It just it wasn't just that the story was bigger but that we wanted more emotion in the movie,\" he added.\n\nTom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, which is playing in theaters now. It's the beginning of the end for the action-packed franchise, as Cruise reteams with longtime collaborator and filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie for more death-defying and breathtaking stunts. Hunt and allies Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) attempt to track down a new weapon with the power to tear the world apart. Actors Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, and Esai Morales join the cast for the latest installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise, which is set to wrap up with Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two."

        "text": "Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is now playing in theaters, and it marks the third film of the Tom Cruise-led franchise to be helmed by Christopher McQuarrie. It's also the first time that a Mission: Impossible story has been split into two parts. Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two is scheduled to be released next June, but that will likely be pushed back because the production is currently on pause due to the WGA and SAG strikes. Recently, McQuarrie spoke with Collider and explained why Dead Reckoning has been split into two parts.\n\n\"Well, we knew with Fallout. Fallout really grew because of all the character and emotion we were putting into the story, all the things that we had discovered in Rogue Nation that was so unexpected,\" McQuarrie explained. \"I knew I wanted to expand the cast, and I knew I wanted to give each one of those characters more to do, so I knew the movie was going to be bigger and longer than Fallout.\"\n\nHe continued, \"And at which point I said, 'Why are we fighting this? Why are we going to try to jam this into two hours? Let's just break it in half and make it two movies.' That really was the rationale behind it being a two-part movie. It just it wasn't just that the story was bigger but that we wanted more emotion in the movie.\" He added, \"At that time, the studio were actually very genuinely excited about it ... And, you know, I think we were excited about it too. And then there were times when we were on set, and Tom would look at me, and he'd say, 'This was your idea. Just remember that.'\"\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One at the Box Office:\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One has gotten rave reviews, but it hasn't had a very successful run at the box office. The movie is currently up on Rotten Tomatoes with an impressive 96% critics score and a 94% audience score, but it's just not matching the success of other July releases such as Barbie and Oppenheimer. However, the movie isn't exactly a flop, and even reached a box office milestone this week. According to Collider, the seventh Mission: Impossible film has now made $450 million worldwide.\n\nWhile $450 million after three weeks isn't exactly terrible, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is the second-lowest-grossing movie in the franchise. The last installment, Mission: Impossible – Fallout, remains the highest-grossing movie in the franchise with a total of $791 million worldwide. Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation made $688 million worldwide, Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol made $694 million worldwide, and Mission: Impossible II earned $550 million worldwide. The original Mission: Impossible earned $457 million worldwide, which means Dead Reckoning Part One is guaranteed to beat its numbers, however, the first movie was a much bigger success than the current installment when adjusted for inflation. That just leaves Mission: Impossible III, which earned the lowest of the franchise at $399 million worldwide.\n\nWhat Is Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning About?\n\nTom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, which premiered in theaters on July 12th. It's the beginning of the end for the action-packed franchise, as Cruise reteams with longtime collaborator and filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie for more death-defying and breathtaking stunts. Hunt and allies Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) attempt to track down a new weapon with the power to tear the world apart.

        "text": "Rome’s iconic monuments are getting lots of mileage in Hollywood movies this summer.\n\nSince May, the Eternal City has hosted the world premieres of “Fast X” and “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” two blockbusters that burned rubber and wreaked havoc on its cobblestoned streets.\n\nUniversal held its “Fast X” red carpet in the Roman Forum’s Temple of Venus, with the Colosseum as a backdrop, in early May. Weeks later, Paramount descended for the June premiere of “M:I 7,” with Tom Cruise prancing down the same Spanish Steps that serve as the setting for spectacular car chases in both movies.\n\n“We’ve done car chases in ‘Mission: Impossible’ movies before, but nothing like this one,” boasted Cruise on the red carpet. The wild “M:I 7” sequence follows a massive Hummer in hot pursuit of a vintage pint-sized yellow Fiat 500. The latter is driven by Cruise and Hayley Atwell, who, in true “Mission: Impossible” fashion, are handcuffed together as the Fiat darts down the ancient staircase.\n\nVin Diesel was similarly amazed by the access granted for “Fast X”: “I could not believe that there was a [Dodge] Charger and we were shouting ‘Action!’ in front of the Colosseum,” he said to Variety. “I never would have dreamed of that happening 20 years ago.”\n\nNeither would the Rome Film Commission, which is taking major strides to make the Italian capital friendlier to film crews as it looks to lure Hollywood shoots.\n\n“These Rome premieres are the crowning moment of a journey that has made Italy much more attractive as a shooting destination in recent years,” says Cristina Priarone, who heads the Rome commission and also presides over the Italian Film Commissions Assn.\n\nThe game changer, Priarone underlines, is Italy’s generous 40% tax rebates for international film and TV series, which were introduced in 2008 and are among the highest in Europe (topping those of France, the U.K., Germany, Hungary and Romania). In addition, her team has been working closely with local authorities to cut red tape, so the Rome municipal permits office is now “a well-oiled machine.” Meanwhile, Rome’s storied Cinecittà Studios, which has housed productions from “Ben-Hur” to “Gangs of New York,” is undergoing a significant revamp, further boosting the city’s standing as a moviemaking magnet.\n\nPriarone notes that “M:I 7” began production in Italy in early 2020 at the start of the pandemic: “We all worked together with regional authorities and the unions to create the conditions for this shoot to take place.”\n\nAt the packed premiere in the Auditorium della Conciliazione, a stone’s throw from the Vatican, Cruise said solemnly onstage, “Everyone knows what was going on in the world when we shot this film here.”\n\n“Had it not been for every person in the entire [Rome] community who worked with us, from the restaurants in the streets, to the police, to everyone on the roads, to the government and medical staff — all making sure that we’re all safe — we would not have been able to create what we’re going to see this evening,” he added.\n\nAs for Cruise, the movie star arrived more than 90 minutes late for the gala, having been sidelined by an impromptu meeting with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.\n\nAccording to sources, he wanted to personally thank the Italian premier for making the “M:I 7” event on the Spanish Steps possible. Meloni is believed to have overridden pushback from some local authorities, who were against holding the launch at the 18th-century landmark due to concerns over wear and tear.\n\nThose concerns are indeed well founded.\n\nRoughly a year ago, a 37-year-old Saudi national drove a rented Maserati down the storied staircase, causing damage. He was caught at Milan’s Malpensa airport after being identified by police from images of the vehicle that were caught on surveillance cameras.\n\nSo when in Rome, don’t try what you’ve seen at the movies."

        "text": "Tom Cruise is one of the most popular celebrities in the world and undoubtedly has a one-of-a-kind personality. While he has delivered unforgettable performances and performed death-defying stunts in his recent films, his love life has also been intriguing. Since gaining worldwide fame in the 1980s, Cruise has been romantically linked to several women, and what’s interesting is that most of them are fellow celebrities.\n\nAccording to several reports, his latest girlfriend is his co-star in the upcoming film, ‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One.’ It’s important to know how he became a global icon. Today, he continues to captivate audiences with his on-screen presence.\n\nTom Cruise remains an enigma in Hollywood, leaving us all eager to see what he does next, both personally and professionally. So, let’s take several steps back and get to know about all the gorgeous women he has been romantically linked with over the years. Take a deep breath because the list is quite extraordinary.\n\nMelissa Gilbert\n\nBefore he became Tom Cruise, he was just Tom Mapother. And who was lucky enough to catch his eye during his struggling actor days? None other than the stunning Melissa Gilbert! In one of the most scandalous revelations, Gilbert told Watch What Happens Live that she dated Cruise when she was merely 16 or 17 years of age. Back then, Cruise was a struggling artist trying to make it big, while Gilbert was already a rising star on ‘Little House on the Prairie’. She even went as far as buying him his first set of dishes. But alas, their fiery romance burned out after a few months.\n\nIt’s fascinating to see how Cruise’s journey began in Hollywood and we don’t how many secrets are locked up in the depths of Tom Cruise’s past.\n\nPatti Scialfa\n\nAfter a short-term relationship with Gilbert, there were rumors of his alliances with Heather Locklear and Rebecca de Mornay. Although these relationships remain unconfirmed, there is one spicy fling that can’t be ignored. Brace yourself, for in 1985, Cruise set his sights on none other than the radiant Patti Scialfa.\n\nAccording to a sizzling People Magazine report, Scialfa had a whirlwind romance with Cruise. From passionate encounters to the fiery embrace of everlasting love with Springsteen, Scialfa’s journey has been one for the books.\n\nCher\n\nTom Cruise and Cher dated in the 80s after meeting at a wedding. They were both famous at the time, with Cher being a pop sensation and Tom Cruise starring in movies like ‘Top Gun.’ They dated for about a year but eventually broke up. Despite the breakup, they shared a good friendship, and Cher even mentioned Tom Cruise as one of her top lovers in an episode of Watch What Happens Live. This was the last time Tom Cruise dated someone more famous than himself, as his fame grew after the release of ‘Top Gun.’\n\nMimi Rogers\n\nThe ‘Mission: Impossible star wed actress Mimi Rogers in 1987, but their union was short-lived. It’s speculated that Rogers introduced Cruise to Scientology, but regardless, their relationship couldn’t stand the test of time. Rogers blamed intimacy issues and their differing career trajectories. Both had successful starts in the film industry, with Rogers earning acclaim for her roles in films like ‘Gung Ho,’ ‘Someone to Watch Over Me,’ and ‘Street Smart,’ yet she found herself overshadowed by Cruise’s stardom. But Rogers didn’t leave empty-handed and received a $4 million settlement in their divorce.\n\nNicole Kidman\n\nTom Cruise wasted no time moving on from his failed marriage to Mimi Rogers and set his eyes on the gorgeous Nicole Kidman. Reports reveal that the sparks flew on the set of ‘Days of Thunder’ in 1990, and by the time they filmed ‘Far and Away’ in 1992, they were already husband and wife. This power couple sent shockwaves through Hollywood, but their sizzling on-screen chemistry couldn’t save them from the tumultuous reality of their relationship. It has been widely reported that their collaboration in ‘Eyes Wide Shut’ (1999) only fueled rumors of their troubled marriage. In the end, the couple’s diverging careers tore them apart and Entertainment Weekly reported that they got divorced in 2001. It’s one of those stories that went down in flames, but they remain united as co-parents to their adopted children, Isabella Jane and Connor Antony.\n\nPenelope Cruz\n\nWe all know how passionate Tom Cruise is and his intense passion knows no bounds. That’s why he didn’t waste any time swiftly moving on from one failed marriage to another while working on the movie, titled ‘Vanilla Sky’. Without any guesses, his irresistible charm captivated his co-star, the ever-so-gorgeous Penelope Cruz, who played his enchanting love interest on-screen. Despite being so ridiculously famous, they managed to hide their romance from almost everyone. But it seems, Cruz and Cruise were never to stay forever with each other and their love affair reached its inevitable end in 2004. People Magazine went on to report that the duo broke up in January 2004. There were reports that the couple reconciled, as both Cruise and Cruz insisted on remaining in each other’s lives, but sadly, they were just rumors and they never got back with each other. A tale of passion, allure, and the bittersweet nature of Hollywood love.\n\nKatie Holmes\n\nThis one needs very little introduction. Tom Cruise’s relationship with Katie Holmes became a public spectacle when the actor took the stage on ‘The Oprah Winfrey Show’. He didn’t leave any stone unturned to unleash a flood of unbridled love for the stunning Katie Holmes. Their relationship left viewers captivate and cringing at the same time. The duo exchanged vows in 2005 and embarked on a beautiful journey. A year lear, their married life got even better with the arrival of their precious daughter, Suri. However, just like Tom Cruise’s previous marriages, this also couldn’t stand the test of time. The couple ended their marriage and got divorced in 2012.\n\nIn an interview with InStyle, Holmes didn’t shy away from admitting that the attention of being married to Tom Cruise was “overwhelming”.\n\nHayley Atwell\n\nTom Cruise always tends to find love and even though his love life has slowed down, he can never be out of the game. According to The Sun, Cruise started dating his ‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One co-star Hayley Atwell in 2020. Their relationship blossomed when the movie went into production. Everything looked pretty normal until the day their fairytale love story came to an end in May 2022.\n\nWhile we don’t know the official reason for their split, Tom Cruise and Atwell appear to be very friendly while promoting the movie.\n\nMust Read: BTS RM Felt Like Getting “Slapped Out Of Nowhere” After He Got Accused By Another Rapper Of Selling Out For Better Money: “Something Everyone Has To Go Through Once In Their Lives”\n\nFollow Us: Facebook | Instagram | Twitter | Youtube | Google News"

        "text": "Wondering if you should choose to accept the latest “Mission: Impossible” entry? Maybe you’re sick of all the bombast at the movie theater lately? Well, put it another way: Do you really want to disappoint Tom Cruise?\n\nOn the first day cameras were rolling for “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning, Part One,” Cruise drove a motorcycle off an actual 4,000-foot Norwegian cliff and then parachuted down. He did it for you. The least you can do to repay him is watch his movie, right?\n\nIf you do give in, you’re in for a treat — a heart-pounding, never dragging, mission accomplished that takes audiences from the frozen Bering Sea to the rooftop of Abu Dhabi International Airport and the narrow alleyways of Venice.\n\nIt’s got plenty of facemasks being ripped off, a car chase through Rome, a shoot-out in the desert, a sword fight on a bridge and an intense, runaway train sequence that may top anything the franchise has ever produced.\n\n“This is getting exciting,” one character says early on and you’ll heartily agree.\n\nChristopher McQuarrie returns for the third time as director of the spy series — he also helped write Cruise’s “Top Gun: Maverick” — and he’s brought back love interest/spy Rebecca Ferguson, comic relief buddies Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames, Vanessa Kirby as The White Widow and Henry Czerny as slimy Eugene Kittridge.\n\nNewcomers include Esai Morales as a very bad baddie and Pom Klementieff as his psychotic aide. Hayley Atwell also makes her impressive debut, playing a master thief and possible romantic partner for Cruise’s Ethan Hunt. (If that makes too many love interests, you’d be right.)\n\nThe bad guy isn’t a guy this time, it’s a haywire form of conscious artificial intelligence that has infiltrated every nation’s computer systems and represents a Hollywood fever dream of this emerging technology. (And maybe a swipe at CGI, too.)\n\nThis AI can foul up every digital device with “the power to bring the world to its knees” — or at least to a pre-internet, analog state. It’s “an enemy that is everywhere and nowhere.” The filmmakers aren’t too keen in giving too many specifics, leaving it an existential threat and giving it the very non-threatening nickname, The Entity.\n\n“Dead Reckoning,” as the “Part One” in the full title suggests, is another action franchise going epic with several-part arcs — like “Spider-Verse” and “Fast & Furious” already this year — and uses a two-part special key as the plot device that everyone desperately needs, like in “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts.”\n\nThe key here is sought by Cruise, our thief/love interest, a U.S. Special Operations team, Morales’ nasty Gabriel and the arms dealer The White Widow. It soon gets swiped, pickpocketed and seized, jumping from owner to owner like an unwanted Secret Santa office gift.\n\nWhat’s so special about this key? Somehow, the AI needs it and one estimate of its worth is $100 million, which seems pretty cheap, to be honest. “The fate of the world rests on finding whatever the key unlocks,” we are told. Rhames’ Luther warns his friend: “Ethan, you’re playing fourth dimensional chess with an algorithm.”\n\nIf other “Mission: Impossible” outings have sometimes felt that Hunt is, well, a little robotic, this time the filmmakers allow some humanity to peek through. Cruise shows some delightful annoyance at having to sit in the passenger seat as his car careens backward through Rome, like an exasperated Drivers’ Ed instructor after a long day. He also shows a tender side in Venice as he cuddles Ferguson in the twilight and they hold hands on a gondola.\n\nSpeaking of that car chase in Rome — the second time this year that the iconic Spanish Steps have been shattered by a brash, hulking U.S. franchise — we get the delightful image of Cruise and Atwell handcuffed together scooting along in a tiny, vintage yellow Fiat 500.\n\n“Is anyone NOT chasing us?” she asks.\n\nAll the interested parties come together at one of those big, elegant Eurotrash dance parties with dark lighting, thumping rave music and writhing dancers on platforms that only Hollywood seems to love, a sequence most recently bettered by “John Wick: Chapter 4” in Berlin.\n\nThen a movie that started filming pre-pandemic and has a two-and-a-half-hour runtime, culminates with Cruise’s motorcycle leap, a breathless fight sequence on top of a steam train and then a derailment that forces the good guys to climb through railcar after railcar vertically as they dodge debris, bad guys and even, in a sly move, a falling piano.\n\nAre you possibly not going to accept this mission? Tom Cruise basically flew for you. It would be rude to leave him hanging.\n\n“Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One,” a Paramount Pictures release that’s only in theaters starting Friday, is rated PG-13 for “intense sequences of violence and action, some language and suggestive material.” Running time: 156 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.\n\n___\n\nMPAA Definition of PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned.

        "text": "“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” was finally unveiled at a starry world premiere in Rome on Monday evening, drawing a packed gala screening in the Auditorium della Conciliazione, a stone’s throw from the Vatican.\n\nThe gala screening was delayed by more than 90 minutes as Tom Cruise was holding an apparently impromptu meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni at the Palazzo Chigi, seat of the Italian government.\n\nThe crowd in the auditorium grew increasingly annoyed with having to watch interviews from the red carpet held earlier on the Spanish Steps in what started seeming like an endless loop on the venue’s screen, equipped with a Dolby Atmos sound system for the special occasion.\n\nHowever there was warm applause when Cruise, director Christopher McQuarrie, and a large contingent of the film’s ensemble – including Hayley Atwell; Rebecca Ferguson; Simon Pegg; Vanessa Kirby; Pom Klementieff, Esai Morales, Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis – finally arrived.\n\nAnd as soon as Rome appeared on screen the audience started breaking into cheers and shouting out: “Bravo Tom!” which happened quite frequently through the screening.\n\nThe event was held in tandem with the Rome Film Festival’s independently run Alice in the City section, dedicated to films for youth audiences. The film’s local distributor is Eagle Pictures, which has a local distribution partnership with Paramount. A substantial amount of the hotly anticipated action film was shot in the Italian capital.\n\n“Dead Reckoning Part One” follows the events of “Fallout,” where Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt and his crew of secret agents saved the world from a nuclear apocalypse amid a series of double-crosses. The 2018 release was the highest-grossing entry in the franchise yet, earning nearly $800 million at the global box office.\n\nThe new film stars Cruise once again, alongside returning franchise players Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Henry Czerny and Vanessa Kirby. Series newcomers include Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, Cary Elwes, Rob Delaney, Indira Varma, Shea Whigham, Mark Gatiss, Esai Morales and Charles Parnell.\n\nAs expected, the film drew strong notices out of its premiere for its impressive stunts. One of the most prominent death-defying acts pushed in the marketing features Cruise actually riding a motorcycle off the edge of a cliff.\n\nSimon Pegg, who returns for “Dead Reckoning” after featuring in the previous five installments told Variety that the film’s core is the rapport between Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie, which began in 2011 with “Ghost Protocol” on which McQuarrie served as an uncredited writer.\n\n“It’s become a kind of self-perpetuating evolving relationship where they’ve just egged each other on and challenged each other to move the story forward; to increase the scale; increase the ambition,” Pegg pointed out.\n\nThe seventh “Mission: Impossible” entry will be released by Paramount on July 12. See reactions to the film below.\n\nCollider’s Perri Nemiroff said it was “another winner for the franchise” with production values “through the roof” and “well-defined and exhilarating set pieces.”\n\n#MissionImpossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is another winner for the franchise. Yet again, the production value is THROUGH THE ROOF with some of the most well-defined and exhilarating set pieces photographed in ways that truly make you feel like you’re in the middle of the… pic.twitter.com/yAX0eJ1t1t — Perri Nemiroff (@PNemiroff) June 19, 2023\n\nUproxx writer Mike Ryan said “‘Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One’ works as Christopher McQuarrie’s ambitious examination of/meditation on AI and the dangerous path we might be on.”\n\nMISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – DEAD RECKONING PART ONE works as Christopher McQuarrie’s ambitious examination of/meditation on AI and the dangerous path we might be on. (He doesn’t like it) With the inherent nature of being “part one” (said that a lot lately), not as satisfying as FALLOUT — Mike Ryan (@mikeryan) June 19, 2023\n\nScreenrant’s Joe Deckelmeier said “Hayley Atwell STEALS every scene she’s in.”\n\n#MissionImpossibleDeadReckoning this phenomenal! Hayley Atwell STEALS ever scene she’s in. This is now my favorite #missionimpossible film. With the AI being the villain, this feels like a cautionary tale. The action had my heart rate elevated.

        "text": "Riding a motorcycle off a cliff and learning the dangerous sport of speed-flying weren’t the only requirements for acting in “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One.” Tom Cruise also had to fight co-star Esai Morales on the roof of a train moving at 60 miles per hour. The latest “Dead Reckoning” behind-the-scenes featurette confirms that Cruise and Morales, the latter of whom plays the film’s villain, shot the fight scene practically, meaning they were literally strapped to the top of a train as it sped through a valley in Norway.\n\n“When we started talking about this movie in the terms of a sense of adventure, an action sequence on a train is something we always wanted to do,” writer-director Christopher McQuarrie said. “We wanted to build upon the previous films and apply that knowledge to something practical and real and bring this train sequence to another level.”\n\n“There was not a surplus of trains available to be wrecked,” he added. “We had to build the train if we wanted to destroy it. To shoot it practically was extremely challenging. Not just to execute it, but to design all of the different train carts that could function on a real train track.”\n\nThe train’s speed hit the 60 miles per hour mark during filming. That might seem crazy to film on, but for Cruise it’s just another day on the set of a “Mission: Impossible” movie.\n\n“I’ve done fight scenes, but to do them on a moving train is trial by fire,” Morales said. “But that’s how Tom like to do things.”\n\nA previous featurette revealed Cruise hit speeds of up to 50 miles per hour while speed-flying during one sequence of the movie. Speed-flying, which McQuarrie described as “one of the most dangerous sports in the world,” is similar to paragliding, although the flyer stays closer to the slope as to pick up more speed. Staying closer to the slope increases the chance of collision with land.\n\n“It’s a very beautiful and delicate sport,” Cruise said of speed-flying. “We’re gonna do spirals, and we’re landing at an incredibly high speed, over 80 kilometers an hour.”\n\nWhile speed-flying and fighting atop a speeding train present their own risk factors, the most death-defying stunt in “Dead Reckoning” is Cruise riding a motorcycle off the edge of a cliff. The stunt was performed on the first day of filming. Cruise preferred it that way, as his survival would determine the rest of filming on the $200 million tentpole.\n\n“Well we know either we will continue with the film or we’re not. Let’s know day one!” Cruise recently told Entertainment Tonight about filming the stunt at the very start of production. “Let us know day one what is going to happen: Do we all continue or is it a major rewrite?”\n\n“I was training and I was ready,” Cruise added. “You have to be razor sharp when you’re doing something like that. It was very important as we were prepping the film that it was actually the first thing. I don’t want to drop that and go shoot other things and have my mind somewhere else. Everyone was prepped. Let’s just get it done.”\n\n“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” opens in theaters July 12 from Paramount Pictures."

        "text": "ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The red carpet unfurled Monday in Abu Dhabi for Hollywood action megastar Tom Cruise, who was on hand for the Middle Eastern premiere of “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.”\n\nCruise was met by an enthusiastic crowd of fans and movie buffs eager to catch a glimpse of the star at the Emirates Palace Hotel in the capital of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nDressed in a tailored tuxedo and flashing his signature smile, Cruise appeared moved by the exuberant reception, stopping to speak with many attendees. The evening’s buzz was punctuated by the “Mission: Impossible” theme, its familiar chords adding a layer of cinematic nostalgia to the night.\n\n“I’m a cinephile, I love movies and the history of cinema and how this art form develops,” Cruise told The Associated Press on the red carpet. “I didn’t know whether the audience was going to embrace (the first Mission: Impossible movie), it was the first film I ever produced and I did it because I wanted to challenge myself in many ways as an actor, as a producer, as a storyteller.”\n\n“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” is the seventh installment of the blockbuster $3.5 billion grossing franchise famed for jam-packed action and ever-daring stunts performed by the 60-year-old Cruise himself.\n\n“We’ve had a lot of fun coming up with these moments,” said Cruise.\n\nThe Mission: Impossible series follows the globe-trotting adventures of Ethan Hunt, a secret agent of the Impossible Missions Force, or IMF, as he undertakes high-risk covert operations. Picture heart-racing action, sophisticated gadgets, and Cruise’s Hunt executing death-defying stunts at every turn.\n\nMatching the topic of the moment, Hunt and his IMF team are tasked with tracking down a potent new artificial intelligence weapon in “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.” Scenes include base-jumping off a cliff on a motorcycle, hurling a steam train off an exploded bridge, and drifting a yellow Fiat 500 through Rome’s winding streets.\n\nIn a nod to the locale, the film incorporates several action sequences in Abu Dhabi. The desert landscapes of Liwa, known as the Empty Quarter, set the stage for intense horseback chases and firearm confrontations. Cruise runs across the dune-shaped roof of Abu Dhabi International Airport’s new Midfield Terminal in another scene.\n\n“When you see us shooting a sequence in Abu Dhabi, it’s about that culture, it’s about that country, and that’s why we keep coming back here,” said Christopher McQuarrie, who is returning for the third time as director of the high-octane spy series.\n\nMcQuarrie joined Cruise on the red carpet along with other Mission: Impossible co-stars, both new and returning. Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff made their franchise debut, while Simon Pegg reprised his role as Benji Dunn, a character known for infusing comedic relief into the franchise’s most tense scenes.\n\n“When you have a film which is high-tension you need that to occasionally be injected in order to make it a little bit more enjoyable,” said Pegg.\n\nFollowing pandemic delays, the production companies behind the franchise, Paramount Pictures and Skydance, pushed the film’s release from September of 2022 to July of 2023. A leaked video from the set featured Cruise launching an expletive-laden rant at colleagues after he reportedly spotted two crew members failing to respect social distancing rules. The star expressed his concern about the potential consequences, which included shutting down production and jeopardizing the then-struggling movie industry and the jobs it supports.\n\n“We just had to write the rulebook on how to make a film during a pandemic,” said Pegg. “Make sure everything was super safe, that was Tom’s biggest challenge in a way was to make us all feel safe and be safe, somehow we muddle through.”\n\nCruise was praised by many for his role in revitalizing Hollywood following the industry’s pandemic-induced stagnation. This recognition came on the heels of his blockbuster film, “Top Gun: Maverick,” which not only marked Cruise’s first $100 million debut but also signified the return of blockbuster movies to theaters as the most significant movie debut since the onset of the pandemic.\n\nAbu Dhabi marks the third premiere location for “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” with the red carpet previously rolled out at the Spanish Steps in Rome and Leicester Square in London. The movie is set to open in U.S. theaters on July 12."

        "text": "One of the stars of Mission Impossible 7 just shared some NSFW details about the love life of Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt.\n\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is now playing in theaters, as the world gets to check back in on Cruise's IMF (Impossible Mission Force) team and the happenings of the series' iconic secret agent.\n\nHowever, while some of his rival spy franchise faces might be known for their carnal adventures as they globetrot across the world, Cruise's Hunt has largely kept to himself.\n\nNot to say he has not had the opportunity to branch out romantically, playing alongside actresses like Vanessa Kirby and - most recently - Hayley Atwell; however, Ethan has been devoted to only two women across the series, his (now) ex-wife Julia (played by Michelle Monaghan) and Rebecca Ferguson's Ilsa.\n\nGetting NFSW About Ethan Hunt's Love Life\n\nParamount\n\nWhile speaking at the New York City Mission Impossible 7 premiere, series star Rebecca Ferguson offered an NSFW answer when asked about the love life of Ethan Hunt (the main character of the series played by Tom Cruise).\n\nIn an interview with Variety, Ferguson, who plays Ethan's current love interest former MI6 agent Ilsa Faust, commented on the pair's in-universe relationship, remarking \"People sit and they watch and go, 'Are they going snog?'\" She thinks \"Who the fuck cares:\"\n\n“I think how I would describe their relationship is that of fierce devotion, love that goes beyond any form of relationship substance because it’s boring, that’s a boring storyline. You know, people sit and they watch and go, 'Are they going snog?' And I think, 'Who the fuck cares?' You know what I mean?\"\n\nShe added that the two are a \"perfect incomplete couple,\" being \"two very similar characters constantly driven to do what is best, getting in the way of each other:\"\n\n\"We’ve all seen that. This is support. They’re two very similar characters constantly driven to do what is best, getting in the way of each other. They are reliably unreliable, and they just make the most perfect incomplete couple. They are juxtaposition.”\n\nIs Ilsa Ethan Hunt's Perfect Match?\n\nAfter fans have wondered for years where Ilsa and Ethan stand in the Mission Impossible franchise, it is interesting to hear from someone directly involved in the will-they-won't-they relationship.\n\nAfter the events of Mission: Impossible - Fallout, it seems that Tom Cruise's franchise figurehead has finally moved one from his wife Julia and is fully ready and open to officially starting a relationship with Ilsa.\n\nOf course, one of the key pillars on which Ethan Hunt is built is the fact that he can never truly love someone as he is too worried they will be brought into the crossfire when secret agent business calls.\n\nBut Ferguson's former MI6 agent is kind of the perfect fit for the situation. She has proven she is more than capable in the field, having now helped Ethan on two world-saving adventures (three if one counts Dead Reckoning Part One).\n\nAnd Ferguson seems to understand that. Yes, it's funny to hear her share her NSFW response when asked about the two, but she gets that Ethan and Ilsa are more than just a flavor of the week James Bond-style couple.\n\nThey are just too busy protecting each other and the world at large to do anything about it. Hopefully, one day, when Ethan and Ilsa's government agent days are over (which may not be coming any time soon), the pair can finally settle down and get the happily ever after ending they are searching for.\n\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is in theaters now."

        "text": "I’ve noticed over the last couple of years that when actors work with Tom Cruise , some of them fall in love with the action star’s sky-related hobbies. For example, he paid for his Top Gun: Maverick co-star’s flight training , and now Glen Powell, who played Hangman, is a pilot. The same kind of effect happened to the actor’s Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One co-star Pom Klementieff , who revealed she fell in love with skydiving after the man behind Ethan Hunt gifted her lessons.\n\nKlementieff, who plays the assassin after Hunt in Mission: Impossible 7 , spoke about all her favorite things with NYT . It’s an eclectic list that included her motorcycle, baking, “not-safe-for-work socks,” Quentin Tarantino and more. However, the item that stuck out to me was skydiving. She mentioned that she took it up after being given lessons as a wrap gift from Tom Cruise. The thoughtful present, turned into quite the hobby for the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 star, as she said:\n\nI’ve jumped 104 times since October 2021, when Tom Cruise gifted me skydiving lessons as a wrap gift. I love the rush, I love the precision, I love how sharp it makes me. When I jump off a hot-air balloon very early in the morning and the sun is rising and it smells like mist — it’s magical.\n\nIt sounds like Tom Crusie’s “need for speed” (and skydiving) has rubbed off on the Dead Reckoning Part One cast member. The Top Gun star is known for being quite the adrenaline junkie both on and off screen (I mean did you see that motorcycle cliff jump in M:I 7 ?), and he seems to love sharing that passion for extreme hobbies with his friends and co-stars.\n\nThis story about Pom Klementieff getting into skydiving because Tom Cruise gifted her lessons reminds me a lot of how Glen Powell got into aviation. The Top Gun: Maverick star got his license in 2020, and he noted in his Instagram post about it that the Maverick actor played a big part in the accomplishment. The Set It Up star said his co-star gifted him flight lessons for Christmas, and he was inspired to pursue aviation because he had watched the actor/producer “rocket off into the sunset” while filming the legacy sequel.\n\nMuch like Powell, Klementieff found her passion for the sky after working with Tom Cruise. While she said she was “stressed” working with the M:I star because of the secrets they had to keep about the movie, she also called him “generous,” and “such an inspiration.”\n\nHopefully, we’ll get to see Pom Klementieff and Tom Cruise jump out of planes together. But, for now, we can look forward to them facing off in Dead Reckoning Part One, which is set to premiere on the 2023 movie schedule on July 12."

He recently revealed how much more he has yet to film in the upcoming Tom Cruise-led sequel.\n\nSpeaking to Collider, McQuarrie revealed, “We've shot [in] all but one of our international locations.”\n\nHe continued, “We've shot our big action set piece except for the biggest set piece, the central set piece of the film, which is massive and unlike anything we've done, and, I think, unlike anything you've ever seen.”\n\nIn conclusion, “All the interstitial stuff is shot. There are characters in the movie you don't even know about yet. And I have one. — how would I call it? It's a sidebar action sequence involving the team, which we haven't shot yet, and that's first up as soon as we get back. It's involving elements that I've never worked with before. It's a big challenge, and it's a tight schedule.”\n\nSo when does he expect to get back to work on the eighth Mission: Impossible? “The plan to be wrapped for all principal photography is early next year,” he said.\n\nMission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part Two will be released on June 28, 2024, so they have quite a bit of time to finish filming and head into post-production. The latest film already pushed the boundaries of what can be done in film, it's hard to imagine what Tom Cruise and Co. have in store next.\n\nMission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One will be released on July 12. Dead Reckoning Part Two will be released on June 28, 2024"

        "text": "Just a year after Tom Cruise set the box office ablaze with ‘Top Gun: Maverick’, Hollywood’s most bankable star is looking to achieve a new record with the seventh installment in the Mission Impossible series, ‘Mission Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One’. The movie will release on July 12, across 2,000 theatres in India.\n\nMission Impossible 7’s impressive advance booking numbers\n\nThe movie has created a huge buzz ahead of its release, with people booking well over 62,000 tickets for the coming weekend. The Tom Cruise film has already earned Rs 2.76 crore in the Indian box office from advance bookings. Over 62,588 tickets for the weekend have already been sold across just PVR, Inox, and Cinepolis theatres, reported Box Office World. Reports claimed the advance bookings to be over 68,000 for the opening day alone and a staggering total of over 1.5 lakh tickets across the five-day opening weekend.\n\nMission Impossible set for $1 billion run?\n\nWith positive early reviews, good responses to trailers, the general excitement about the movie, there is significant hype behind the ‘Mission Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One’ across social media. Add to the fact that Cruise’s last entry, ‘Maverick’ had earned a cool $1.49 billion worldwide and the last Mission Impossible entry, ‘Fallout’ had earned $791.1 million worldwide, expectations for his latest silver screen showing are high.\n\nThe year 2023 has been a mostly disappointing year for international movies. The highest-grossing movie of the year, and the only one to cross the $1 billion mark, was ‘The Super Mario Bros. Movie’. Several films from big franchises like ‘Shazam! Fury of the Gods’, ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’, ‘The Flash’ have essentially bombed. While ‘Fast X’ and ‘Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3’ were solid hits, they failed to cross over the $1 billion mark.\n\nTom Cruise vs Mario\n\nMission Impossible 7’s biggest opponent so far on the charts is ‘The Super Mario Bros. Movie’. The movie managed to rake in over $770 million at the international box office, which MI 7 will hope to beat with Cruise’s international appeal as a Hollywood superstar. ‘Dead Reckoning’ has the potential to become the biggest movie of 2023, but will face stiff competition from Greta Gerwig’s ‘Barbie’ and Christopher Nolan’s ‘Oppenheimer’, which will be fighting it out on July 21.\n\nAbout Mission Impossible 7\n\nHelmed by Christopher McQuarrie, the latest Mission Impossible film sees Ethan Hunt and his newest mission, should he choose to accept it, revolve around the threat only known as \"The Entity\". Hunt, played by Cruise, along with his fellow IMF agents are in a deadly race to track down a terrifying new weapon that threatens all of humanity. Apart from Cruise, the movie also stars Tom Cruise, Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, and Rebecca Ferguson in familiar roles.\n\nSocial media wowed by Cruise’s Mission Impossible\n\nAhead of the film's launch, Mission Impossible 7 is witnessing a huge buzz on social media, as fans are eagerly waiting to see Cruise's death-defying stunts. Starting from the time when Tom Cruise shared the first behind-the-scenes video of his jump from a cliff to the exhilarating train sequence, the film has been in the news.\n\n‘Mission Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One’ is set to be the penultimate installment with Cruise reprising his role as Ethan Hunt, with ‘Dead Reckoning: Part 2’ in June 2024."

        "text": "Vin Diesel and Jason Momoa’s Fast X emerged as the first 100 crore nett earner at the Indian box office in 2023 and now, everyone awaits the release of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, aka Mission: Impossible 7. With Tom Cruise leading the film, expectations are really high and it could even become the biggest hit in the post-pandemic era. Keep reading to know more!\n\nSurprisingly, Cruise has never delivered a 100 crore movie at the Indian box office but with MI 7 enjoying huge pre-release buzz, the actor is expected to make his much-awaited entry into the coveted club. For the unversed, his last release ‘Top Gun: Maverick‘ did a business of 35 crores in India and was a successful affair.\n\nIn the post-Covid era, Tom Holland’s Spider-Man: No Way Home is the biggest Hit in India as its profit stands at 182.66%. Its theatrical valuation is 75 crores here and in return, it made 212 crores in the lifetime run. In the second position is Fast X with 162.5% returns. Avatar: The Way Of Water (157.93%) and Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness (153.88%) are also on the list.\n\nExact valuation of Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible 7 is yet to be known, but crossing Spider-Man: No Way Home‘s 182.66% returns won’t be a huge task if the film hits the right chord with the audience. As of now, considering all the craze and the franchise’s popularity in India, the film is expected to open around 20 crores or even more.\n\nIt’ll be interesting to see if Tom Cruise gets the most-profitable Hollywood film in the post-pandemic era under his kitty with Mission: Impossible 7!\n\nStay tuned to Koimoi for more box office stories & updates!\n\nNote: Box office numbers are based on estimates and various sources.

Their hard work appears to have paid off as a common theme among critics is that Dead Reckoning delivers some of the best action scenes in the franchise.\n\n“MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – DEAD RECKONING PART ONE works as Christopher McQuarrie’s ambitious examination of/meditation on AI and the dangerous path we might be on. (He doesn’t like it)” Mike Ryan tweeted. “With the inherent nature of being ‘part one’ (said that a lot lately), not as satisfying as FALLOUT.”\n\nMISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – DEAD RECKONING PART ONE works as Christopher McQuarrie’s ambitious examination of/meditation on AI and the dangerous path we might be on.

The fastest 2 hr 30 min movie I’ve seen in a long time. One of the best films I’ve seen this year and @TomCruise has done it again. Demands to be seen on the biggest screen. Cannot recommend this movie enough. pic.twitter.com/GOB1WyX2Mi — Steven Weintraub (@colliderfrosty) June 19, 2023\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is phenomenal on the action front, especially in the first hour. Hayley Atwell steals every scene. The villain, cliffhanger, and runtime didn’t blow me away but the rest is wildly entertaining and brilliantly filmed. It’s solid. pic.twitter.com/z4Im8S0oQc — BD (@BrandonDavisBD) June 19, 2023\n\nSaw the #MissionImpossible7 embargo lifted and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Fun and slick. Hayley Atwell was MVP for me. Rebecca Ferguson is god-level and has a sword fight that is next level. Impeccably cast, beautifully shot. Ready for the finale. pic.twitter.com/hIVVyGtl0U — Kristen Lopez (@kristenlopez88) June 19, 2023\n\nThere's a car chase scene in #MissionImpossibleDeadReckoning that brought me so much joy, it reinvigorated my love for the summer blockbuster. The craftsmanship of this franchise is unmatched. The final train sequence is a whopper too – I caught myself leaning IN from my seat. — Nigel Smith (@nigelmfs) June 19, 2023\n\n#MissionImpossibleDeadReckoning this phenomenal! Hayley Atwell STEALS ever scene she’s in. This is now my favorite #missionimpossible film. With the AI being the villain, this feels like a cautionary tale. The action had my heart rate elevated. That train scene is mind blowing! pic.twitter.com/raHLqTwqEO — Joseph Deckelmeier (@joedeckelmeier) June 19, 2023\n\nI had the absolute best time watching #MissionImpossible – an impeccably made action film that does not stop entertaining. Each action sequence is long, crazy & intense. The story is big & sprawling, but I like how it both felt complete & left you dying for what comes next pic.twitter.com/iNaKlDMH8l — Erik Davis (@ErikDavis) June 19, 2023\n\n#MissionImpossibleDeadReckoning is easily the thrill ride to beat this summer. Great new characters, amazing action set pieces and a surprising new villain. (The less you know the better.) Also the last act is probably the greatest train sequence ever. Bring on part 2. pic.twitter.com/um2gipldF8 — Drew Taylor (@DrewTailored) June 19, 2023\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One jumps into theaters on July 12."

He completed the outfit with black boots, black sunglasses, and a stylish watch.\n\nThe Top Gun star seemed to be in a cheerful mood as he was photographed just before boarding his private helicopter to Biggin Hill.\n\nHe has been occupied with preparations for the highly anticipated seventh installment of the Mission Impossible franchise.\n\nThe Magnolia star, along with Hayley Atwell, shone on the red carpet on Thursday for the premiere of Mission: Impossible 7 Dead Reckoning Part One in London.\n\nDespite facing significant delays because of the COVID-19 pandemic and an unprecedented budget of $290 million, the 60-year-old Hollywood actor and his 41-year-old co-star appeared thrilled to be commemorating the film's release.\n\nDuring the red carpet event, the duo was accompanied by Rebecca Ferguson, who returned to her role as Ilsa Faust.\n\nEarlier this week, the world premiere in Rome garnered enthusiastic reviews from early critics, who praised it as \"dynamite\" and predicted it to be a summer blockbuster."

        "text": "Christopher McQuarrie’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One expands on the themes of technological anxiety that animated last year’s Tom Cruise vehicle, Top Gun: Maverick, which McQuarrie co-wrote and began with the threat of human pilots being phased out in favor of drones and artificial intelligence. Here, the generic roster of villains that dot the Mission: Impossible franchise reaches its logical endpoint, with the interchangeable global terrorists replaced with an experimental A.I. dubbed “The Entity” that’s become sentient and gone rogue, prompting various national agencies and independent parties to embark on a hunt for the program’s site of operation to either destroy it or weaponize it for their own ends.\n\nIn both movies, the thematic subtext of A.I.’s looming threat is obvious, as much a warning against dehumanized warfare as a commentary on the increasingly soulless, anti-human nature of blockbuster filmmaking that Cruise’s old-school allegiance to practical stunts and star power seeks to defy. Admittedly, there’s a sense of having one’s cake and eating it to this idea, not only because both films are pieces of franchise IP, but because Dead Reckoning Part One in particular throws up a completely boilerplate Mission: Impossible plot of Ethan Hunt (Cruise) attempting to thwart global disaster while also protecting those closest to him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery installment of this franchise uses these narrative touchstones as launching pads for the main draw of spellbinding action, but Dead Reckoning Part One treats its formulaic plot as if it were newly concocted. Much is made of how Ethan’s comrades are targeted in order to get to him, but this has been a common feature of all of the movies in this franchise, and the film isn’t done any favors by his long-standing comrades feeling so bland and dispensable.\n\nIn fact, the supporting player with the most gravitas and who’s given the most attention isn’t even a returning character like Simon Pegg’s Benji Dunn and Ving Rhames’s Luther Stickell but newcomer Grace (Hayley Atwell), a thief whose attempts to steal the key to The Entity place her in constant conflict with Ethan’s team as they seek the same device. It’s a bizarre pivot, as it robs some heavy moments between Ethan’s teammates of their intended gravity.\n\nStill, Atwell makes a phenomenal addition to the series and is the most consistently engaging actor here. The film doesn’t attempt to set up Grace as another doomed romantic partner for Ethan, instead letting the actress channel some of that adventure-serial sass and self-reliance that she brought to her Peggy Carter in the first Captain America. McQuarrie has gradually amped up the comedy in this franchise over the course of his involvement, and Atwell proves to be the most reliable mouthpiece for his blend of Wilderesque banter and screwball physicality.\n\nCompared to Grace’s complexity, it’s hard to overlook how poorly defined the film’s antagonists are. When it comes to The Entity, that lack of definition is initially presented as a feature and not a bug, with its faceless, incorporeal presence contributing to its omnipresent menace. But there are too few demonstrations of the A.I.’s actual power, and in the place of showing The Entity in action there’s endless exposition from other characters about its potential to do harm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Entity’s chief human asset, a mysterious figure named Gabriel (Esai Morales), is even less defined, though that’s partially by design. With the final Mission: Impossible installment now split into two films, basic details about Gabriel’s background are withheld from us, effectively reducing the man to little more than a reciter of generically menacing monologues. An ingenious moment, in which the possibility of a secret mastermind manipulating Ethan and the villains alike is teased, harkens back to the post-Cold War commentary of Brian De Palma’s Mission: Impossible, only for the film to immediately walk back that idea.\n\nHappily, the film finds its footing when it comes to its action, even blatantly echoing signature moments from the franchise. The first, a frantic car chase through Rome, recalls the Paris segment from McQuarrie’s Fallout (and inadvertently features a moment of careening down the city’s Spanish Steps that greatly resembles a moment in this year’s Fast X). Meanwhile, a climactic brawl on a train can’t help but bring to mind the conclusion of the first film in the franchise. But Dead Reckoning Part One approaches these sequences from fresh angles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the car chase, McQuarrie makes excellent use of sudden intrusions of civilian cars into the edges of the frame to heighten the chaos of Ethan barreling down ancient streets as police and special ops assassins pursue him. The pandemonium of a random driver accidentally colliding with Ethan and sending his car spiraling out of control brings some of the real world into the cartoonish antics of Mission: Impossible and forces the spy to think quickly on his feet.\n\nThose cartoonish aspects are riotously reinforced, though, in a climactic train sequence that’s as much a straightforward action showstopper as it is a tribute to Buster Keaton’s The General, with Ethan and others frantically attempting to reckon with a runaway locomotive careens toward a ravine. The absurd images of characters clamoring out of a series of rail cars slipping into oblivion cap off a recurring element of visual comedy that runs through the film. Ethan repeatedly and amusingly stays one step ahead of his pursuers, often sprinting away in the background as agents in the foreground look around for him in frustration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe action consistently snaps the film into focus, but it also further illustrates how badly the decision to split this narrative into two parts throws off the delicate rhythm that’s made Mission: Impossible arguably the most consistently entertaining American action franchise of all time. When Dead Reckoning Part One settles into its set pieces or moments of caper comedy, it soars. As such, it inevitably makes one hope that the overabundance of setup will translate to a second part that sends Ethan into the sunset on a more streamlined and refined note.\n\nScore: Cast: Tom Cruise, Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, Henry Czerny Director: Christopher McQuarrie Screenwriter: Christopher McQuarrie, Erik Jendresen Distributor: Paramount Pictures Running Time: 163 min Rating: PG-13 Year: 2023 Buy: Video Tom Cruise, Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, Henry CzernyChristopher McQuarrieChristopher McQuarrie, Erik JendresenParamount Pictures163 minPG-132023"

        "text": "There's not really a plot in \"Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One\" but there sure are a lot of plot-lets.\n\nThere's a free-spirited pickpocket (Hayley Atwell) who tangles with Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt. There are agents tasked with taking down Hunt, who has been classified as a rogue. And the \"dead reckoning\" part of that unwieldy title refers to the steering of a nuclear submarine that is glimpsed in the opening sequence and then mostly forgotten about. What we know about the sub is that it contains half of a key to an artificial intelligence device whose owner will — all together now — control the world.\n\nLike last month's \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,\" \"Reckoning\" tries to revitalize a several decades-old franchise with both the pursuit of a world-controlling key that comes in two pieces and the pairing of the veteran hero with a much younger raven-haired Englishwoman (Atwell).\n\nThis seventh \"Mission\" incorporates bits from previous entries in the series, which underscores how much it has changed from its beginnings, Brian De Palma's elegant, Hitchcock-influenced 1996 spy thriller. John Woo's sequel began the process of transforming \"Mission\" movies into loud, James Bond-esque, world-traveling adventures that are packed with stunts — and no \"Mission\" has been more stunt-packed than \"Dead Reckoning.\"\n\nThere's the motorcycle-off-a-cliff sequence that has been analyzed since it debuted online last year but also a race to defuse a bomb hidden in the luggage network of an airport, a battle atop a speeding train (another element \"Destiny\" shares), a pursuit through the beautifully lit alleys of Venice and a thrilling car chase in the streets of Rome that feels fresh because it features something old (as in \"The 39 Steps,\" our hero is chained to a woman who dislikes him) and something witty and quite new: The car they're in doesn't work very well.\n\nWriter/director Christopher McQuarrie, who also made the last \"Mission,\" stages these sequences with skill and energy. Things are chaotic, obviously — something is almost always on the verge of blowing up — but McQuarrie makes sure we have enough spatial information to understand where the bad guys and good guys are in relation to each other.\n\n\"Mission\" has plenty of good guys — in addition to Cruise and (possibly) Atwell, colleagues Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson and Simon Pegg are back. Although they're initially anti-Hunt, there also are a couple of CIA types played by Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis, the latter of whom is positioned to be a future \"Mission\" lead if Cruise decides to hang up his masks.\n\nBad guys, though? Not so much. Esai Morales and Vanessa Kirby both underplay their villains to such an extent that they practically vanish, a consistent problem in \"Mission\" movies. Movie fans can easily name half a dozen 007 villains but, give or take Philip Seymour Hoffman in the third one, can you come up with a single \"Mission\" antagonist?\n\nPerhaps a charismatic baddie will emerge in \"Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part Two,\" scheduled for next June. I'm guessing there will be more of a plot in that one, too, since the final scenes of \"Part One\" finally get us back to that submarine and since several promising actors are being added for that eighth \"Mission,\" including Hannah Waddingham, Janet McTeer and Nick Offerman.\n\nOne advantage of \"Part One\" de-emphasizing plot is that there's not a lot for it to wrap up. It ends on a cliffhanger, to be sure. But unlike divided-in-two movies such as \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\" \"Part One\" actually feels like a complete movie, one that gives us plenty of satisfying sequences but also leaves us wanting more.\n\n'Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One'\n\n*** out of 4 stars\n\nRated: PG-13 for violence and language.\n\nWhere: In theaters."

        "text": "Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is fast approaching and during a recent interview with director Christopher McQuarrie, he offered an explanation as to why the film was split into two parts, and it’s not just because it was a bigger story. During a recent interview with Collider, McQuarrie said:\n\n\"Well, we knew with Fallout. Fallout really grew because of all the character and emotion we were putting into the story, all the things that we had discovered in Rogue Nation that was so unexpected. I knew I wanted to expand the cast, and I knew I wanted to give each one of those characters more to do, so I knew the movie was going to be bigger and longer than Fallout.\"\n\nThen it just got to the point where the creative team questioned why they were trying to fit everything they wanted to do into one movie. They wanted to build an epic story and make sure there was enough time to play with the emotion of it all. McQuarrie went on to say:\n\n\"And at which point I said, 'Why are we fighting this? Why are we going to try to jam this into two hours? Let's just break it in half and make it two movies.' That really was the rationale behind it being a two-part movie. It just it wasn't just that the story was bigger but that we wanted more emotion in the movie.”\n\nThe filmmaker then went on to talk about the challenges of developing a two-part action thriller epic, saying:\n\n\"Yeah, it's massive, and it was complicated by the fact that certain things in Part Two required stopping Part One to shoot them, whether it was because of weather or actor availability. And so, with all the other challenges that were confronting this movie while we were making it, there was the challenge of stopping in the middle, not even knowing what the full movie was, and trying to predict what it was in the second film. It's a testament to how great this team is and how patient this cast is. It's really something.”\n\nWell, I’m really excited to see how the story these next two films tell will play out! Everything I’ve seen from Dead Reckoning Part One has been awesome, and the reviews that have been coming in are extremely positive. So, it seems like fans are in for another awesome Mission: Impossible adventure!\n\nIn Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, “Ethan Hunt and his IMF team embark on their most dangerous mission yet: To track down a terrifying new weapon that threatens all of humanity before it falls into the wrong hands. With control of the future and the fate of the world at stake, and dark forces from Ethan's past closing in, a deadly race around the globe begins. Confronted by a mysterious, all-powerful enemy, Ethan is forced to consider that nothing can matter more than his mission – not even the lives of those he cares about most.”\n\nThe movie stars Tom Cruise, Hayley Atwell, Rebecca Ferguson, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Vanessa Kirby, and Henry Czerny along with newcomers Shea Whigham (Joker), Pom Klementieff (Guardians of the Galaxy 2, Avengers: Infinity War) Esai Morales (La Bamba, Titans), Charles Parnell, Indira Varma (Game of Thrones), Mark Gatiss, and Cary Elwes (Saw). Nick Offerman (Parks and Recreation), Janet McTeer (Tumbleweeds, Albert Nobbs), Hannah Waddingham (Ted Lasso), and Holt McCallany (Mindhunter, Nightmare Alley).\n\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One hits theaters on July 12th and Part Two is currently dated July 28th, 2024."

        "text": "The film hits cinemas on July 8, but pre-production started in 2019 before experiencing significant delays due to the pandemic. Shot with a budget of $290 million, it is set to be one of the year’s biggest box office releases, a film designed to drag audiences back into cinemas. Completing his own stunt work has become a part of the Cruise mythology. According to McQuarrie, that has been the aim of his leading man all along. “These are the kinds of movies we need right now, we’re looking at an industry hanging on by its fingernails, and Tom is doing everything he can to bring people back to the theatre,” he says. That’s no understatement. From driving motorbikes off cliffs to base jumping onto a moving train, Dead Reckoning is a testament to Cruise’s willingness to try anything once. “We actually did the cliff thing six times,” laughs McQuarrie.\n\nCompleting his own stunt work has become a part of the Cruise mythology; he famously broke his right ankle during a roof-jumping stunt on Mission: Impossible 6. For a director, it sounds like a working nightmare, a hugely famous lead determined to do everything himself. “It’s stressful, but I wouldn’t have it any other way, and neither would Tom; it’s all very considered,” says McQuarrie. “The other day, someone made a comment about him being fearless, and he said, ‘It’s not that I am not scared; it’s that I don’t mind being scared,’ and that’s the difference. People assume Tom Cruise is a daredevil, but he’s just dedicated to confronting the fear.’” At 61, Cruise may soon need to confront a different fear; getting older. He remains the world’s most bankable and daring action star, with contemporaries like Stallone and Schwarzenegger no longer vying for box office dollars.\n\nBut with Dead Reckoning set to be a two-part epic, might Cruise call it a day after this? “Even if I knew the answer to that question, I couldn’t be sure because I’ve learned that with Mission: Impossible and with Tom, you just don’t know what will happen when we wrap,” says McQuarrie. Should the impossible become possible and age catches up with Cruise, the franchise could have ready-made replacements in British actress Atwell and French Avengers star Klementieff. Simon Pegg, Hayley Atwell, Tom Cruise and Pom Klementieff. Atwell plays Grace, a sleight-of-hand expert who ends up working alongside Ethan Hunt, while Klementieff is Paris, a French assassin tasked with hunting the pair. Both hold their own in Dead Reckoning, undergoing five months of intense training before filming commenced.\n\n“I certainly learned a lot, but this series is so synonymous with Tom; if there were a spin-off, it wouldn’t be the classic Mission: Impossible world,” says Atwell. Loading “There would have to be some understanding that it is new territory, but it could work; I don’t know if I am prepared to jump off a cliff. Klementieff agrees, adding: “The way the females are developed makes them powerful and have their agency; they never depend on the man, they aren’t girlfriends, and much of that comes down to what Tom wants.” “I don’t know what the future holds, but I will always be ready to play Paris.”\n\nHow Dead Reckoning Part One will perform remains to be seen, but the bar has been set high. The previous MI film, Fallout, had a total worldwide gross of US$791 million against a production budget of $178 million, becoming the franchise’s highest-grossing film so far. Dead Reckoning opens two weeks before both Barbie and Oppenheimer, two of the other most hyped films of the year. But if he’s feeling the pressure, McQuarrie does an excellent job of hiding it. Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie on the set of the new Mission: Impossible film. “Ultimately, Barbie and Oppenheimer are also movies made by people who want to make movies for the audience, not an audience, and that is the smart thing; that’s what we’re all trying to do; more power to them.” Hard to argue with that."

        "text": "Tom Cruise and the Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One crew are detailing what went into filming the epic speed-flying scene for the upcoming film.\n\nThe actor, known for going above and beyond with his stunts, learned how to do what director Christopher McQuarrie called “one of the most dangerous sports in the world” for the latest installment in the action franchise.\n\nIn a recent video giving a behind-the-scenes look at the movie, the filmmaker explained that since “there are no limits” with Cruise, “we become a little bit more adventurous every time.” And this time, the actor decided to do a “sport very few people on this planet do.”\n\nMcQuarrie went on to explain that “while it may look similar, speed-flying is not skydiving. Skydiving is fairly predictable. Speed-flying is incredibly unpredictable.”\n\nThe air sport, similar to paragliding, combines elements of parachute swooping to allow people to fly at high speeds down mountainsides while maintaining close to the slope.\n\nIn the footage, Cruise said of the stunt, “We’re gonna do spirals, and we’re landing at an incredibly high speed, over 80 kilometers an hour.”\n\nMcQuarrie added that although it “looks quite beautiful” when “flying very close to rocks,” the crew was in “absolute terror” behind the cameras. Especially since they had to overcome several technical challenges, including coming up with the stunt and finding the most dynastic way to shoot it.\n\nThe director called the whole experience a “one-of-a-kind adventure.”\n\nTaking on death-defying stunts is nothing new to Cruise. Throughout his decades-long career, the actor has continued to look for ways to push the limits for projects, from scaling a skyscraper to dangling on the outside of a plane. In his upcoming film, he also drove a motorcycle off a cliff and parachuted to safety on the first day of filming.\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is set to hit theaters on July 12."

It was so obvious to me. But it wasn’t obvious to Edgar,\" McQuarrie says in the new issue of Total Film magazine, which is out on newsstands on Thursday, June 22.\n\n\"And when I asked the audience, it wasn’t obvious to them either. Nobody thought to bring it up until Edgar did. And that changed the entire movie. It changed the entire movie for the better. You just need honesty and clarity and awareness. No one person, Tom [Cruise] included, can really sit there, and look at the movie 24 hours a day, objectively. Tom and I will just look one another in the eye, and say, 'do we want to change this? Or is this what we prefer?'\"\n\n(Image credit: Paramount Pictures)\n\nDead Reckoning Part One is the seventh instalment in the Mission: Impossible film series, starring Cruise as IMF agent Hunt. The cast includes Ving Rhames, Hayley Atwell, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, Simon Pegg, Shea Whigham, Indira Varma, Rob Delaney, and Cary Elwes.\n\nThe flick centers on Hunt and his IMF team as they try to track down a humanity-threatening weapon before it falls into the wrong hands. During the mission, Ethan's dark past comes back to haunt him, as he comes face to face with his new nemesis Gabriel.\n\nProduction was among the first to shut down for Covid in 2020, while Nicholas Hoult had to drop out of the film due to scheduling conflicts. McQuarrie also estimated that Atwell was on set for \"over 100 days before she had her first dialog scene, owing to the chaotic nature of the production\".\n\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One hits cinemas on July 10 in the UK and July 12 in the US.

It’s this man, Mr. Tom Cruise. When this whole process started four years ago, we were entering a period where it looked like this event was headed for extinction. It was a very real possibility that this medium that we loved so much was on its way out. One person said, ‘No, we’re gonna keep it going’. And that’s this man right here,” McQuarrie said.\n\nThe Sydney premiere fell on Cruise’s 61st birthday, however both McQuarrie and the star himself insisted there was nowhere he’d rather be.\n\n“I think he deserves a big hand,” McQuarrie said of Cruise. “He loves this medium and loves entertaining a big audience on the big screen. And I want you to remember that when he’s throwing himself off a cliff later, he did it for you. He didn’t do it for me. He did it for you.”\n\nFor his part, Cruise said it was amazing to be back making big blockbuster films for audiences to enjoy.\n\n“When to see how much an audience enjoys it [it’s amazing],” he said. “I make my movies for you all, all my movies I make, and I’m dreaming and I’m thinking about this experience and to see how much you all enjoy it, that such a gift to me.”\n\nAs for whether there will be any other “Mission: Impossible” films in the franchise following “Dead Reckoning – Part Two”, Cruise simply said “talk to me next year”. He did, however, concede there were more stunts and adventures he wanted to partake in.\n\n“There’s always another mountain, there’s always something else, but let’s enjoy this evening first,” he said."

        "text": "Contrary to media reports, “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part Two” is not being delayed by the ongoing writers’ strike and shooting is set to resume later this summer after Tom Cruise and the film’s cast complete their promotional work for “Part One,” according to insiders with knowledge of the production.\n\nLast week, Empire Magazine published an interview with “Dead Reckoning” director Christopher McQuarrie, where he acknowledged the delays and hurdles that his team’s work on the two “M:I” films have had to face.\n\n“Behind each tsunami is another tsunami,” McQuarrie said. “It’s unrelenting. We live in a state of 24-hour tsunami awareness. That’s just what we do.”\n\nWhile McQuarrie was not quoted as referring to specific delays such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the article says that “obstacles for this double production have already included a pandemic and now encompass an ongoing writer’s strike.”\n\nThis led other film media outlets like Slash Film to report that the writers’ strike has extended the current pause on shooting, which studio insiders say is inaccurate as McQuarrie and Cruise are taking a scheduled break from production to do interviews for “Dead Reckoning: Part One” and to attend that film’s premiere in Rome next weekend.\n\nThe WGA strike, which is currently in its seventh week, has led to shutdowns on countless film and TV productions while on-location permits for shooting in the Los Angeles area have dwindled to zero over the past month. But some high-profile productions have pushed on, including Marvel Studios’ “Deadpool 3,” which is still shooting in Canada ahead of a rescheduled release date in May 2024.\n\nIt is still possible, however, that the productions that are still shooting during the WGA strike may also be forced to pause if the actors union SAG-AFTRA fails to reach a deal on a new labor contract during its ongoing talks with the studio labor representatives at the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. SAG-AFTRA’s members have overwhelmingly authorized their leaders to order a strike if it cannot reach an agreement after the current labor contract expires on June 30.\n\nIn addition to forcing a pause on all productions, an actors’ strike would also affect the publicity campaigns for several late summer films and for the upcoming Emmy nominations, which will be announced on July 12.\n\n“Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” will not be one of the films affected, as Paramount insiders say the film’s press junkets and premiere had been scheduled before the June 30 SAG-AFTRA deadline for several months for unrelated reasons. But other July and August films, such as Warner Bros.’ “Barbie” and “Blue Beetle,” as well as Universal’s Christopher Nolan film “Oppenheimer,” may have their publicity plans disrupted.\n\n“Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” hits theaters on July 12, with “Part Two” currently scheduled for release on June 28, 2024."

One scene in Dead Reckoning, which Tom filmed in real life, sees the A-lister drive a motorcycle off a cliff.\n\nWhile Tom volunteers himself for the very nerve-wracking scenes, he has to go through director and longtime collaborator Christopher McQuarrie to get them off the ground (literally), and according to the filmmaker, there were a number of stunts he regrets signing off on.\n\nWhile chatting at the UK premiere in London in June, Christopher told virginradio.co.uk that they both said yes to stunts, no matter how dangerous... but not without some trepidation.\n\nHe explained: “There were a number of stunts I have suggested which I then later regretted ever having brought up. But [Tom will] rise to any challenge, anything you throw at him, he's excited to try.”\n\nOn whether he’s ever felt scared watching Tom at work while on land, sea or air, Christopher admitted it’s not always easy viewing seeing the megastar put himself through dangerous situations.\n\nChristopher added: “It's definitely frightening. It's more frightening in retrospect. You're so focused on all of the many moving parts and eliminating all of the variables. You just have to live in the moment. You just have to be very, very present and in the present time.\n\n“You might have the time to think about what could have gone wrong, but the movie keeps going. I'm sure some time a couple of years from now, I'll look back on this and think, what was I thinking? Until then, we just have to finish the movie.”\n\nShaun of the Dead actor Simon Pegg was also on the red carpet for the premiere where he spoke about the lead actor's stunts.\n\nDescribing Cruise as \"a one off,\" Pegg said: \"Tom never comes to a stunt without having spent months practising, rehearsing, training, you know, so anytime he does anything, it would require that level of commitment. And I don't know if I have it, I mean, he's a one off, I need to be sitting in an armchair watching the TV, you know, he would never do that.\"\n\nFor more Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One news, make sure you tune into The Chris Evans Breakfast Show with cinch tomorrow (Friday 7th July) from 6:30am to hear from M:I star Hayley Atwell.\n\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1 is out in cinemas on Monday 10th July."

Photo: Paramount Pictures\n\nShe adds that he even made time for her grandmother, revealing: \"He was so kind to my family and other cast members' families. He took my grandmother on a helicopter ride on Christmas Eve over London. That's pretty amazing. People don't often hear those kinds of stories of how generous and kind he is off off-screen.\"\n\nRELATED:\n\nHayley adds how it changed the dynamic on set, saying: \"I think that he knows that if you're creating an environment where people feel seen, they feel like it's a welcoming one, it's a wholesome one because friends and family are welcome.\n\n\"And in that world, it's going to provide an environment where people really feel creatively free. And I so appreciated that, stepping into something of this kind of scale and size and ambition, having his kindness alongside that enabled me to work better.\"\n\nSimon Pegg, Pom Klementieff, Tom Cruise, Hayley Atwell and Christopher McQuarrie at the Sydney premiere of Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One. Photo: Getty (Getty Images)\n\nTom also gushes about his co-stars, telling us on the red carpet: \"This cast, we have a lot of fun together. There's a lot of hard work, a lot of joy, a lot of dedication, and particularly that kind of time that we went through. It's taken a long time for us to make it because of [Covid lockdowns].\"\n\n\"Simon's always making us laugh, Pom and Hayley – they're just incredibly humorous, talented and just lights.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMission: Impossible cast on shooting another film in Australia\n\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One features some incredible locations, with an insane car chase taking place in the city of Rome. Photo: Paramount Pictures\n\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One features some incredible locations from Rome, Venice and Norway, where Tom shot his insane motorcycle stunt. While Mission: Impossible II was shot in Sydney 24 years ago, Hayley agrees it's time to bring the franchise back to Australia.\n\n\"Oh God yeah!\" she says enthusiastically. \"This would be an amazing place to shoot, and I think what's beautiful about these movies is everywhere they shoot, it's a love letter to that location. And you hire local crew, and then we as actors have the privilege of coming and spending actual real-time here. So, getting immersed in the culture, getting immersed in the sights and the architecture and the geography of a place – oh my God, I'd love it if it was here! Let's try to make that happen.\"\n\nSimon Pegg, who just missed out on shooting in Australia as he joined the franchise for its third instalment, agrees, telling us: \"Heck yeah! That's all we said yesterday as we were walking up the coastal road at Bondi, I was like, 'We need to make the film here!' It would be so much fun.\"\n\n\"The open space is beautiful,\" Pom Klementieff, another newcomer to the franchise, adds.\n\nTom reveals he 'doesn't mind being scared'\n\nTom performing his biggest stunt to date in Norway for the film. Photo: Paramount Pictures (Christian Black)\n\nWhile Tom is known to do all of his own stunts, Hayley and Pom also did their fair share of insane scenes, with Hayley telling us one scene that terrified her takes place with Tom on a train towards the end of the film.\n\n\"There's a moment when the vertical train carriage – so train has gone from horizontal to vertical in six seconds – and [Tom's] asking me to jump across this kind of gaping carriage which goes into a ravine at the bottom. And in one take he just went, 'Do you trust me?' and I was [furiously shakes head, before slowly nodding], 'I mean, sure!' And [my reaction is] real. Mission: Impossible is a metaphor for the making of a Mission: Impossible film and that's why it's edge-of-your-seat stuff, the whole way.\"\n\nPom, who appears in the Guardians of the Galaxy films, is very comfortable with stunts and has been described by a fan as the female Tom Cruise, as she's a bit of a daredevil herself and loves skydiving and riding motorcycles.\n\nPom Klementieff is new to the Mission: Impossible franchise and has made a name for herself as 'the female Tom Cruise' thanks to her daredevil attitude. Photo: Paramount Pictures (Christian Black)\n\n\"I got to run on top of a moving train and jump over carriages in real life!\" Pom tells us. \"Usually in movies you do that on a green screen in a studio and it's not real, it was amazing to get to do that.\"\n\n\"Pom Cruise!\" Simon jokes. \"You're the one person I think that could helm a spin-off because Pom is like Tom, she's a danger person, in real life and on film.\"\n\nHe adds that if you think the stunts in this film are crazy, then Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two will blow you away.\n\n\"I've seen what's coming in the next one,\" he says. \"They just know how to push things further, and I think the key is, is that every film we do we learn something. Tom and [director Christopher McQuarrie] will learn something about filmmaking and they're always the first to admit they're students of film as much as anything.\n\nSimon Pegg (right) reveals that Tom somehow outdoes the crazy stunts in Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One for Part Two. Photo: Paramount Pictures (Paramount Pictures)\n\n\"So they'll take those skills that they learned on one film and they'll put it to use in the other so it can only ever get more adventurous.\"\n\nTom admits he gets scared before a big stunt, like the huge motorcycle jump in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, \"That wasn't acting, that's not acting, let me tell you!\"\n\nHe adds, \"It's not that I'm not [scared], it's just that I don't mind being scared.\"\n\nWhen asked if he believes there'd ever be a stunt too big for the franchise, he says, \"I don't know, we haven't had that yet!\"\n\nChristopher McQuarrie reveals his 'scariest' moment with Tom\n\nDirector and writer Christopher McQuarrie, who has been working with Tom for many years now, also shares with us the stress of watching the actors perform stunts, saying: \"You are focused on everything that can go right, and trying not to think about everything that could go wrong, and you're just very, very relieved it's over.\"\n\nHe adds that even he has had to perform a stunt, though he can't tell us which one it is just yet, \"Can't say what it is, but I had to do it so I knew how to write it. I did it on Top Gun [Maverick], I went flying with the Blue Angels and did the high-speed manoeuvres to understand what G's were like. But in [Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning] Part Two, I had to do one of the stunts because just the physics of it were so particular I couldn't write the sequences until I did it.\"\n\nChristopher also shares his \"scariest\" memory from his many years working with Tom, saying, \"The absolute scariest one was [Mission: Impossible - Fallout] – the helicopter chase in Fallout, only because I was in the helicopter chasing him and that was that was quite a unique experience.\"\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is in cinemas July 8.\n\nNever miss a thing.

        "text": "ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The red carpet unfurled Monday in Abu Dhabi for Hollywood action megastar Tom Cruise, who was on hand for the Middle Eastern premiere of “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.”\n\nCruise was met by an enthusiastic crowd of fans and movie buffs eager to catch a glimpse of the star at the Emirates Palace Hotel in the capital of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nDressed in a tailored tuxedo and flashing his signature smile, Cruise appeared moved by the exuberant reception, stopping to speak with many attendees. The evening’s buzz was punctuated by the “Mission: Impossible” theme, its familiar chords adding a layer of cinematic nostalgia to the night.\n\n“I’m a cinephile, I love movies and the history of cinema and how this art form develops,” Cruise told The Associated Press on the red carpet. “I didn’t know whether the audience was going to embrace (the first Mission: Impossible movie), it was the first film I ever produced and I did it because I wanted to challenge myself in many ways as an actor, as a producer, as a storyteller.”\n\n“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” is the seventh installment of the blockbuster $3.5 billion grossing franchise famed for jam-packed action and ever-daring stunts performed by the 60-year-old Cruise himself.\n\n“We’ve had a lot of fun coming up with these moments,” said Cruise.\n\nThe Mission: Impossible series follows the globe-trotting adventures of Ethan Hunt, a secret agent of the Impossible Missions Force, or IMF, as he undertakes high-risk covert operations. Picture heart-racing action, sophisticated gadgets, and Cruise’s Hunt executing death-defying stunts at every turn.\n\nMatching the topic of the moment, Hunt and his IMF team are tasked with tracking down a potent new artificial intelligence weapon in “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.” Scenes include base-jumping off a cliff on a motorcycle, hurling a steam train off an exploded bridge, and drifting a yellow Fiat 500 through Rome’s winding streets.\n\nIn a nod to the locale, the film incorporates several action sequences in Abu Dhabi. The desert landscapes of Liwa, known as the Empty Quarter, set the stage for intense horseback chases and firearm confrontations. Cruise runs across the dune-shaped roof of Abu Dhabi International Airport’s new Midfield Terminal in another scene.\n\n“When you see us shooting a sequence in Abu Dhabi, it’s about that culture, it’s about that country, and that’s why we keep coming back here,” said Christopher McQuarrie, who is returning for the third time as director of the high-octane spy series.\n\nMcQuarrie joined Cruise on the red carpet along with other Mission: Impossible co-stars, both new and returning. Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff made their franchise debut, while Simon Pegg reprised his role as Benji Dunn, a character known for infusing comedic relief into the franchise’s most tense scenes.\n\n“When you have a film which is high-tension you need that to occasionally be injected in order to make it a little bit more enjoyable,” said Pegg.\n\nFollowing pandemic delays, the production companies behind the franchise, Paramount Pictures and Skydance, pushed the film’s release from September of 2022 to July of 2023. A leaked video from the set featured Cruise launching an expletive-laden rant at colleagues after he reportedly spotted two crew members failing to respect social distancing rules. The star expressed his concern about the potential consequences, which included shutting down production and jeopardizing the then-struggling movie industry and the jobs it supports.\n\n“We just had to write the rulebook on how to make a film during a pandemic,” said Pegg. “Make sure everything was super safe, that was Tom’s biggest challenge in a way was to make us all feel safe and be safe, somehow we muddle through.”\n\nCruise was praised by many for his role in revitalizing Hollywood following the industry’s pandemic-induced stagnation. This recognition came on the heels of his blockbuster film, “Top Gun: Maverick,” which not only marked Cruise’s first $100 million debut but also signified the return of blockbuster movies to theaters as the most significant movie debut since the onset of the pandemic.\n\nAbu Dhabi marks the third premiere location for “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” with the red carpet previously rolled out at the Spanish Steps in Rome and Leicester Square in London. The movie is set to open in U.S. theaters on July 12."

        "text": "Hayley Atwell tells Chris Evans she was picked to star in Mission: Impossible YEARS before being cast\n\nVirgin Radio\n\n7 Jul 2023, 12:09\n\nHayley Atwell has shared how Tom Cruise and collaborator Christopher McQuarrie already had big plans to introduce her into the Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One.\n\nThe Marvel star plays M:I newcomer Grace, who initially ends up on the wrong side of Cruise’s Ethan Hunt, before the two have to come together to stop a deadly AI programme from destroying humanity.\n\nIt turns out that Hayley came along before Grace was even conceptualised, and while chatting on The Chris Evans Breakfast Show with cinch, the actress dished on how Cruise and Mission: Impossible 7 director McQuarrie ended up handpicking her for the exciting new role.\n\nShe explained: “10 years ago, I was in a play, The Pride at Trafalgar Studios here in London and Chris McQuarrie, longtime collaborator of Tom Cruise, came to see it, took me out for dinner and said, ‘I love what you do on that stage, I want to find a character for you’.”\n\nSix years went by, and Hayley then received a phone call from McQuarrie saying he and Cruise were desperate to get her in for a screen test for their next big blockbuster.\n\nOn the rather unique process, Hayley shared: “They don't have a character that they're looking for someone to fit into. They find the actor they want to work with, who understands the process of this world. Then they'll collaborate and create the character as you go along.\n\n“What that meant for me was that I just went, ‘Okay, well, I'll just try a tonne of different things every day and see what sticks.’ For the longest time, I didn't have a character name. I didn't know if she was going to be a villain, if she had any moral compass, who her allegiance would be to. That made her sort of consistently inconsistent. There’s a spontaneity that gives her that sort of freshness, because it's literally sort of making up as I go along.”\n\nWhat followed would be intensive training not just for stunts but for driving too, with Hayley behind the wheel (and handcuffed) to Cruise during one scene in a Fiat 500 in Italy.\n\nYou might expect to find it comforting to share a stunt scene with king-of-action himself Cruise, but according to Hayley, he was the cause of a car crash while the pair were filming.\n\nShe explained: “There would be times when we'd have three cameras on the windscreen. My vision was impaired. I’d be drifting and doing donuts, and then he'd be saying lines to me, but I would have to work out whether it was Tom telling Haley to slow down like something serious had happened or whether he was saying it to me as his character, or he was saying it to me to suggest a line for my character to say. That’s why you've got my performance just going, ‘what is happening?!’ It was great fun.\n\n“There's a moment in the car. Tom actually crashed it because it had a mind of its own. It's such a dangerous little beast. We nicknamed it Trixie. We stopped and he just went well, ‘I guess that's the end of the shooting day for today.’ It ended up being in the film because it was such a fun, funny, spontaneous moment. Nothing got damaged, everyone was safe, so we're like this is great. Let's use it!”\n\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is out in cinemas on Monday 10th July.\n\nFor more great interviews listen to The Chris Evans Breakfast Show with cinch weekdays from 6:30am on Virgin Radio, or catch up on-demand here."

We weren’t meeting to talk about any projects. We started talking about movies. And three hours later, we were still talking about movies!”\n\nThe Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning director further mentioned: “We weren’t even formally introduced at that first meeting, we’ve never actually been formally introduced. We’re just still having that same conversation.”\n\nMcQuarrie and Cruise have worked together on several films, like Jack Reacher, Top Gun: Maverick, Edge of Tomorrow, and many more. Now, the duo has teamed up again for Mission Impossible 7.\n\nTherefore, after speaking about his professional relationship with the 60-year-old actor, he also spoke about having difficulty filming MI 7 amid COVID, reports Entertainment Tonight.\n\n“Every single frame of Dead Reckoning is a surprise, under the circumstances of which we made this movie. It’s a testament to our cast and crew.”\n\n\"They really worked through a lot of extreme adversity and difficulty to bring you this movie. And I’m very, very proud of the work that [they did].”"

        "text": "Henry Cavill’s charisma as Superman and his silent yet powerful presence in The Witcher has made him popular not just with fans but also with the Hollywood fraternity. The British star has been lauded by many of his co-actors, directors he has worked with, and filmmakers who are yet to collaborate with him.\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One director Christopher McQuarrie is among Henry Cavill’s ardent admirers. The filmmaker had high words of praise for the Man of Steel star and his personality and gave an insight into Cavill’s X-factor that made him stand out.\n\nAlso Read: Henry Cavill’s Superman Replacement David Corenswet Was Panicking Before His S*x Scene With 74-Year-Old Actress Patti LuPone: “That’s a beautiful s*x scene”\n\nDirector Christopher McQuarrie’s Assessment Of Henry Cavill\n\nIt is no secret that Henry Cavill has made a long-lasting impression in Hollywood with his two marquee roles as Superman in the DCU and Geralt of Rivia in The Witcher. The star’s arresting good looks combined with his charismatic personality has led to many of his colleagues in the film fraternity lauding him. Apart from Zack Snyder who called him “warrior monk”, Mission: Impossible 7 director Christopher McQuarrie had words of praise for Henry Cavill and his work ethic. To quote McQuarrie,\n\nFandomwire Video\n\n“Henry is a classic movie star. It’s not like there was something in the water in the 1930s and ’40s that there isn’t today. Movie stars are not as abundant now for two simple reasons: The industry wanted and cultivated stars, and there were people ready to do the work required to be stars. Henry is in the category of somebody hell-bent on doing the work, and that work is hard.”\n\nThe director’s keen perception of Cavill’s success proved to be the perfect assessment of the actor who looks to be one of Hollywood’s most bankable stars.\n\nAlso Read: “I was raised with a lot of Buddhist influences”: Before Henry Cavill Fans Ripped Him to Shreds, DC’s New Superman David Corenswet Revealed Secret to Zen Mindset\n\nHenry Cavill And Superman Were Destined To Find Each Other\n\nHenry Cavill has been widely regarded as the perfect choice to play DC’s most celebrated superhero. The character though was always part of his destiny. While the actor made his DC debut in 2013 with Man of Steel, he was considered to play the character many years before that when Terminator Salvation Director McG was tipped to helm a DC project involving Superman. The film did not materialize and Cavill in a interview, spoke of the reasons behind it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I don’t know how close I came. I understand it was very, very close and sadly the movie was canceled because McG didn’t want to fly. He certainly had a big fear of flying at the time; I think he’s since overcome it.”\n\nAfter Cavill’s departure as Superman, the next actor to take on the prestigious role has arrived. It now remains to be seen how James Gunn’s new Superman recruit David Corenswet will fare in comparison to the Man of Steel actor’s memorable portrayal.\n\nAlso Read: Henry Cavill Named His Rescue Pet After Batman Star Ben Affleck for a Surprising Reason Before Filming Zack Snyder’s $873M Movie\n\nSource: The Hollywood Reporter"

With a strong background in screenwriting, McQuarrie, known for his Mission Impossible films, brings a unique perspective to his directing style, creating compelling narratives that captivate audiences. He gained widespread recognition for his work on the film The Usual Suspects, which earned him an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nMcQuarrie’s collaborations with actor Tom Cruise, including Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation and Mission: Impossible – Fallout, have further solidified his reputation. His directorial prowess and commitment to delivering high-quality films have established him as a prominent figure in the industry.\n\nAlso Read: “I hope to be still going”: Tom Cruise Shares Exciting Update for Mission Impossible Future at 61 as Movie Debuts With 100% Rating Ahead of Release\n\nChristopher McQuarrie Was Rumored To Direct Man of Steel 2\n\nPrevious speculations suggested that the director was in the running to take the reins of DC films, particularly for Man of Steel 2. However, in an interview with Screen Rant, Christopher McQuarrie disclosed his enthusiasm for collaborating with Henry Cavill, expressing his eagerness to seize such an opportunity.\n\nFandomwire Video\n\n“To me, I’m interested in a good story. That’s really what it is. I mean, when Man of Steel came up, it was because somebody had asked me, did I want to work with Henry again. Which I would in a second. I go through the door that opens,” he said.\n\nMcQuarrie’s association with another DC film, Green Lantern Corps, was also a subject of speculation, with rumors of his frequent collaborator Tom Cruise potentially taking on a leading role.\n\n“You know, I got to say, Tom and I have never talked about it. We always kind of talk about what we’re working on or what we’re talking about working on next. I think, again, I think if you show them a good story, I think if you showed him a really emotional story, I don’t think, you know, it’s, I can never predict. I can never predict what it is he’s going to be drawn to.”\n\nHowever, the director clarified that he and Cruise never engaged in any discussions regarding the project.\n\nAlso Read: “Stop, stop, stop.. she was having a heart attack”: Tom Cruise’s Joke Was Not Funny at All For Mission Impossible 7 Crew Who Had a Breakdown on a Zoom Call\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristopher McQuarrie’s New Mission: Impossible Gets 98% Rating\n\nChristopher McQuarrie’s latest, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, is off to a promising start, with a 98% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes. It is important to note that this score may fluctuate as more reviews are added. During last year’s CinemaCon, McQuarrie shed light on the significance behind the title Dead Reckoning for the upcoming film.\n\n“When I came up with the title, I knew it applied more to Part Two than it did to Part One, which is why it eventually settled on being Part One and Part Two,” McQuarrie told Light the Fuse. “The title for the first movie was nearly … a title that referred to something like a Ghost Protocol kind of thing; it was a government policy – It wasn’t a government policy, it was a government, what would you call it? A government measure of last resort, with catastrophic consequences.”\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One will release in theaters on July 12.\n\nAlso Read: Tom Cruise Jumped 106 Times From 25,000 Feet To Film Insane Mission Impossible Stunt With Broken Ankle, Never Stopped Smiling\n\nSource: Flickering Myth"

I was fully just expecting amazing stunts and cool locations, but the emotional journey the audience is going on is, for me, what sends it into a whole other stratosphere.\"\n\nSimon Pegg, who plays Benji in the series, agrees that Mission: Impossible’s scope and scale keeps getting bigger and bigger.\n\n\"It did feel different,\" Pegg says. \"Not just because we were making it when we made it, but you know Tom [Cruise] and [director Christopher McQuarrie] are never going to rest on what they’ve done before. They’re going to push it forward. Every film, when it ends, we get asked 'What’s next?' and we think, 'Well, what could we possibly do?'\"\n\nDespite the \"enormity\" of the movie, Elwes – who has appeared in everything from The Princess Bride to Stranger Things – was struck by how nonplussed director Christopher McQuarrie was by the globetrotting production.\n\n\"There was never a bead of sweat on his head, not once,\" Elwes reveals. \"We had to deal with all kinds of things then – COVID, all kinds of logistical things – that a huge production of this nature entails. The guy never broke a sweat. He was totally, totally chill the whole time. So he set the tone on-set and so everyone felt [like] this is great, this is just a fun day at work.\"\n\nFor more from Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, check out our coverage on:"

        "text": "The latest action-heavy trailer for “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” has arrived ahead of its Wednesday premiere.\n\nUnlike the official trailer for the action flick, this latest promotional trailer solely highlights the movie’s action. As the video cuts between Tom Cruise performing seemingly impossible stunts like running on an exploding train and motorcycling off the edge of a cliff, snippets of reviews play appear onscreen. The new teaser doesn’t appear to offer any new footage that hasn’t appeared in the first trailer, but it does emphasize Cruise’s stunts.\n\nSet to debut later this week, the movie is averaging a 99% on Rotten Tomatoes. This latest installment in the spy action franchise was directed by Christopher McQuarrie and co-written by McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen. It serves as a direct sequel to 2018’s “Mission: Impossible: Fallout” and follows Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his IMF team as their confronted by a seemingly all-powerful rival known as “The Entity.”\n\nAlso Read:\n\nSimon Pegg Says Watching Tom Cruise Stunts Is a ‘Terrifying Experience’ (Video)\n\nIn addition to Cruise, the movie stars Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Esai Morales, Vanessa Kirby, Pom Klementieff and Henry Czerny. Skydance and TC Productions produced the film with Paramount Pictures distributing it. “Dead Reckoning Part One” marks the first “Mission: Impossible” movie without J.J. Abrams’ involvment.\n\nBoth of the “Dead Reckoning” films were shot back-to-back with McQuarrie writing and directing. Filming initially began in February of 2020 but was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With a budget of $290 million, it also ranks among one of the most expensive movies ever made.\n\n“Dead Reckoning Part One” will mark the seventh movie in the “Mission: Impossible” franchise. Based on the 1966 TV series of the same name, the first “Mission: Impossible” premiered in 1996 and became an instant hit with audiences despite its middling reviews.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt ranked as the third highest-grossing film released that year and was only out-earned by “Independence Day” and “Twister.” The original movie was then followed by “Mission: Impossible 2,” “Mission: Impossible III,” “Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol,” “Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation,” “Mission: Impossible — Fallout” and now “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.”\n\nPart Two is expected to debut June 28, 2024.\n\nAlso Read:\n\n‘Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse’ Is Now the Top Summer Film at the Domestic Box Office"

She’s a rebel, she’s a killer, she’s extremely skilled and quite lonely too.”\n\nKlementieff said her film name is an homage to Leonard Nimoy, who played the Great Paris on the original Mission: Impossible TV show. “When Christopher McQuarrie cast me for the role, he didn’t know which name the character would have,” she says. “It was cool to name me Paris, me being from France, and then they decided that I would speak French because I speak French in real life.”\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One will hit theaters July 12."

USA, following a series of struggles filming at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. And while the stars had some difficult moments adapting to the many challenges at the time, their most special memories seem to come from the particular way of filming the story, as they revealed that they did not follow a normal script. Check out the full interview below!\n\nLoading the player...\n\n“We didn’t really have a script,” Simon Pegg, who plays Benji Dunn revealed to HOLA! USA. “Obviously [Christopher] McQuarrie is the director, he is also the writer. And so he knows the shape at least of it, and the large of the set pieces,” he explained. “It would always be ‘Oh today you’re gonna learn how to drive a boat in Venice,’ that was surprising, that kind of stuff was surprising.”\n\nPom Klementieff, who plays Paris, explained that “the story is always changing,” and the cast would have “ongoing conversations” with Tom Cruise and McQuarrie. “There is kind of a vision for it, but you kind of discover it in the moment,” Vanessa Kirby said, talking about her experience playing Alanna.\n\n“We didn’t know exactly where we were gonna go with it. It was trying to figure out where our characters would go every step of the way,” Tarzan Davis explained, referring to his character, Davis, and his dynamic with Shea Whigham, who plays Jasper. “They [McQuarrie and Cruise] almost reversed-engineered the way you think film should be made. They follow the story as it’s unfolding, so you don’t really sit down and read a script. They built a script around what’s happening in accordance to relationships and how things are going, so it’s unlike any movie that you will ever make,” Whigham added."

        "text": "Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is heading to theaters this month, and the first reviews are quite promising. The movie is currently up on Rotten Tomatoes with a 98% critics score after 119 reviews. The seventh Mission: Impossible film marks the third to be helmed by Christopher McQuarrie, who is also tackling the upcoming Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two. Recently, the director spoke with Collider and revealed which movies inspired the latest installment to the action franchise.\n\n\"There are films I am inspired by, competing with, in a sportsman-like way, kind of friendly. There are films that I deeply, deeply admire and kind of get stuck in my head. I love movies about the Arctic, I love movies about submarines. Submarines are just cool. The Arctic is just cool. I love The Thing, but I can't really say that The Thing is an influence on Dead Reckoning. I love Das Boot and Crimson Tide, submarines are an amazing high-pressure environment, I can't really say that they're influences on the movie. They're gauntlets. It's a filmmaker showing me some cool environment and me going, 'I want to do that! I want my opportunity to play in that space.'\"\n\nMcQuarrie went on to say that he could list \"a million movies\" that inspire him, but he doesn't directly reference any other films in Dead Reckoning. However, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation did have direct nods to The Parallax View and Three Days of the Condor. As for the yellow Fiat 500 in Dead Reckoning, some fans thought that was a reference to Lupin the Third, but McQuarrie says that's just a coincidence. He explained, \"The Fiat is yellow because it's a really distinct, fun color and that's about it. I didn't really know about Lupin the Third.\"\n\nHe added of the movies that inspire him, \"I see a lot of John Ford in there. I see a lot of Steven Spielberg, Close Encounters, where I'm suddenly looking at something and where I wasn't intending for that to happen. I'm seeing the ghosts of that stuff in there.\"\n\nChristopher McQuarrie Explains Why Dead Reckoning Is in Two Parts:\n\nDuring another interview with Collider, McQuarrie explained why Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning has been split into two parts.\n\n\"Well, we knew with Fallout. Fallout really grew because of all the character and emotion we were putting into the story, all the things that we had discovered in Rogue Nation that was so unexpected,\" McQuarrie shared. \"I knew I wanted to expand the cast, and I knew I wanted to give each one of those characters more to do, so I knew the movie was going to be bigger and longer than Fallout.\"\n\n\"And at which point I said, 'Why are we fighting this? Why are we going to try to jam this into two hours? Let's just break it in half and make it two movies.' That really was the rationale behind it being a two-part movie. It just it wasn't just that the story was bigger but that we wanted more emotion in the movie,\" he added.\n\n\"Yeah, it's massive, and it was complicated by the fact that certain things in Part Two required stopping Part One to shoot them, whether it was because of weather or actor availability. And so, with all the other challenges that were confronting this movie while we were making it, there was the challenge of stopping in the middle, not even knowing what the full movie was, and trying to predict what it was in the second film. It's a testament to how great this team is and how patient this cast is. It's really something,\" McQuarrie explained.\n\nWhat Is Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning About?\n\nTom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, which premieres in theaters on July 12th. It's the beginning of the end for the action-packed franchise, as Cruise reteams with longtime collaborator and filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie for more death-defying and breathtaking stunts. Hunt and allies Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) attempt to track down a new weapon with the power to tear the world apart. Actors Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, and Esai Morales join the cast for the latest installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise, which is set to wrap up with Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two."

The upcoming Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One's premiere was held on June 19 in Rome, one of the locations where it was filmed. Abarth appeared alongside the movie stars, specifically two of its models featured in the movie.\n\nPhoto: Abarth\n\nkWh\n\nEV\n\nkW\n\nAbarth two main characters are the new all-electric Abarth 500e and the iconic 1960s Fiat 500 Abarth. The latter can also be seen in the movie's trailer in a high-speed pursuit.The Mission Impossible series is synonymous with non-stop action. In this next installment, Ethan Hunt ( Tom Cruise ) and his IMF team have to face yet another threat that, of course, threatens all humanity. Ethan has to put the importance of his mission ahead of the lives of those he cares about most, something he struggles with considering.The movie is written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, the mind behind the latest Mission Impossible films and the Jack Reacher movies, also starring Tom Cruise. Dead Reckoning Part One was shot in Rome, London , Abu Dhabi, and several other locations and will hit movie theaters across the globe on July 12.It's no coincidence that Abarth partnered up with Mission Impossible – the Italian brand is all about thrilling driving experiences, just like the ones the audience will enjoy in the upcoming film. The goal is to emphasize the common feeling shared by both brands: adrenaline, power, exciting driving, and extraordinary performance.These values will be showcased in \"Mission Possible,\" a new TV spot where Abarth wants to demonstrate that the new 500e can offer the same excitement, emotions, and fun as a conventional version, making it a \"Mission Possible.\"The Abarth 500e was launched in November last year with a 152-hp (155-ps) electric motor and a 42-battery. This combo allows theto speed up to 62 mph (100 kph) from a standstill in just seven seconds. The 500e has a range of up to 165 miles (265 km), and it can be recharged at up to 85when hooked to DC mains.Initially, Abarth unveiled the Scorpionissima launch edition, which sold out in the meanwhile. Later, the brand came up with two other regular variants , the 500e and the 500e Turismo, offered as hatchbacks or cabriolets.Both models are available with the controversial Sound Generator, the result of more than 6,000 hours of development work. The system was engineered \"to reproduce the legendary sound of the Abarth engine.\" Some say it's a cool feature, while others believe it creates a fake experience. Either way, the driver can turn it on and off, so no harm is done."

        "text": "In \"Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning\" superstar Tom Cruise once again does his own stunts. He's not the only one.\n\nThe new mission echoes the world's current AI concerns: In \"Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,\" Tom Cruise plays agent Ethan Hunt for the seventh time, fighting against a computer program that has gotten out of control and is threatening to wipe out humanity.\n\nThe \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise is a recipe for success for Hollywood. One of the aspects that makes the series so popular is that Tom Cruise performs many of the film stunts himself, without the aid of CGI or stunt doubles. That approach has turned him into an action megastar.\n\nDaring action scenes\n\nUnforgettable scenes in the previous movies include Tom Cruise climbing up the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai, or hanging from a plane as it takes off.\n\nIn 'Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol' (2011), Tom Cruise climbs up the world's tallest building Image: David James/Paramount Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection/picture alliance\n\nA highlight of the new film combines a motorcycle stunt and a parachute jump.\n\nLike the \"John Wick\" films with Keanu Reeves, the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise counters the trend of having blockbuster action scenes created exclusively through CGI.\n\nCruise is perhaps the most famous action star doing his own stunts today. But other actors, including older ones, also insist on filming dangerous sequences themselves in order to make the movie feel more authentic.\n\nJackie Chan: Stunt legend despite serious accident\n\nThis includes Chinese martial arts legend Jackie Chan, who has insisted on doing practically all of his stunts himself since the 1970s.\n\nHis most notable performances are in \"Snake in the Eagle's Shadow\" (1978), \"Police Story\" and \"Police Story 2\" (1985 and 1988) and \"Armour of God\" (1986).\n\nDuring the filming of the latter, Chan almost died while filming a relatively simple stunt. Jumping from a ledge onto a tree, he fell and crashed onto a rock, breaking a few ribs and cracking his skull.\n\nJackie Chan in 'Amour of God,' 1986 Image: Everett Collection/picture alliance\n\nMichelle Yeoh: Former 'Bond girl' and martial arts legend\n\nIn her Oscar-winning role in \"Everything Everywhere All at Once,\" 60-year-old Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh portrays a laundromat owner who in an alternate universe is also a famous martial arts movie star — inspired by the actress' own career.\n\nMichelle Yeoh in 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' (2000), which will be re-released in theaters in 2023 Image: Columbia Films/Entertainment Pictures/ZUMAPRESS/picture alliance\n\nYeoh, who is also among the stars renowned for performing stunts herself, played alongside Jackie Chan in action classics like \"Police Story 3: Supercop\" or \"Supercop 2.\" She rose to international prominence with the 2000 martial arts film, \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\" in which she also did her own stunts.\n\nKeanu Reeves: 'I do all of the action'\n\nCanadian actor Keanu Reeves doesn't shy away from getting his hands dirty in action-packed scenes either. In films like \"Speed\" (1994), \"Matrix\" (1999) or the \"John Wick\" series, he jumps out of moving cars and fights his opponents in nerve-wracking scenes.\n\nIn 'Chain Reaction' (1996), Reeves escapes an explosion on a motorcycle Image: TBM/United Archives/picture alliance\n\nFollowing the release of \"John Wick 3,\" Reeves confirmed in an interview that he did almost all of the stunt work himself: \"I do all of the action. I'm 90 percent of what's happening there. I'm maintaining the connection to the audience, and with the story.\"\n\nHarrison Ford: Stuntman at 80\n\n\"Indiana Jones\" star Harrison Ford can't be left out of any list of actors performing their own stunts.\n\nThe 80-year-old actor has had an impressive film career spanning six decades. His most successful films include the \"Star Wars\" saga and the \"Indiana Jones\" series.\n\nHarrison Ford shot this iconic opening scene from 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' 10 times Image: Paramount/Everett Collection/picture alliance\n\nThe opening scene of the first Indiana Jones movie,\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" is particularly iconic, with Harrison Ford running away from a giant boulder that is chasing him. Even though the rock was a prop, it was still heavy enough to seriously injure the actor, who was not doubled in the scene.\n\nFord completely immersed himself in the role of daredevil archeologist Indiana Jones.\n\nIn the recently released \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,\" he still took over many stunts himself, dislocating his shoulder while filming. But for real action stars, that's just part of the job.\n\nThis article was originally written in German."

        "text": "Since “Mission: Impossible III” in 2006, Simon Pegg has been part of the core ensemble of the “Mission: Impossible” franchise, playing hacker and sometime field agent Benji Dunn opposite its stalwart star Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt. Pegg was never going to be the actor risking life and limb on screen — “it’s Benji’s job to be the one that actually says, ‘what the fuck are we doing here?’,” he observes. But over five installments of the indefatigable series, his character has shifted from questioning what Ethan is doing in the moment to believing absolutely in why he’s doing it, thanks in no small part to the writing and directing of Christopher McQuarrie.\n\nMcQuarrie came onto “Ghost Protocol” as “a sort of master plumber to re-wriggle the pipes,” as Pegg characterizes it, and since became the series’ ongoing co-architect with Cruise. Their partnership reaches its peak, even if by all indications it’s far from over, with “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” half of an operatic culmination of narrative seeds planted since Cruise first played Hunt back in 1996. In a conversation with Variety, Pegg discusses what makes McQuarrie’s creativity so special, and his collaboration with Cruise et al so unique; he also talks about new details he discovered about Benji, explored the challenges of being self-referential in a franchise like this without undermining emotional stakes, and hinted at what is yet to come as he and the rest of the filmmaking team move on to “Dead Reckoning — Part Two.”\n\nYou said that you have shot at least some of these films without a script. What’s actually there for you to work from, and what’s the minimum you need to play a scene without knowing what it might connect to?\n\nWe never don’t have a script on the day of the shoot. The scene will have been written and we would’ve had time to learn it. It’s more that McQ allows the locations we go to, the characters, the actors he’s working with to help him tell the story. He’ll let the story be revealed to him by, say, looking at the streets of Rome or the canals of Venice. It’s a fly by the seat of your pants way of working because you’ve got a rough idea of what you’re doing, but the minutia doesn’t come sometimes until the last minute. But that’s part of being an actor, and I enjoy that — we have a mission impossible going alongside our “Mission: Impossible.” But it’s never not in McQ’s head. He’s not making it up as he goes along, by any means. It’s all in there, you just have to tease it out gradually.\n\nThinking about the screenwriting that you’ve done, Chris’ shares in common this very Swiss-watch precision to it.\n\nWhen Edgar Wright and I write together, we have the Swiss watch laid out on a table and we do it like that. McQ throws it in the air and assembles it as it falls, and it’s extremely educating for me as a filmmaker because it’s the antithesis of what Edgar and I do. That’s partly because a lot of Edgar’s transitions are very precise so we need to know how each scene starts and finishes so that it can dovetail into the next one. But it certainly made me aware that sometimes you can allow the situation to help inform the narrative or the dialogue. That’s because McQ is a master problem solver. If you give him a broken script, he just rubs his hands with glee. If you give him a blank page, he’ll scratch his head. It’s just how he is — he’s an absolute master.\n\nIt seems like it shouldn’t be quite so unique for Christopher to be able to deliver these smart, muscular, inventive action movies, but it is. What is it that makes McQ’s creativity so singular?\n\nI think in Tom, he’s just found such a perfect creative partner, someone who can facilitate that way of working, can allow him to practice this extreme method of filmmaking. I remember when we were making “Ghost Protocol” and the script on that just wasn’t very focused, and Tom brought in McQ, a sort of master plumber to re-wriggle the pipes. And it was on that that their creative romance really took off. They’re both eternal students of film and just methods of filmmaking, methods of storytelling, certain camera rigs. I remember when we shot “Rogue Nation,” we were still using film. The cameras were quite cumbersome. Now, you can put a camera on a motorbike and just send it off a cliff and go down and pick it out of the undergrowth. And they’re forever absorbing these new methods of telling the story. So I just think they found each other — in a way that Lennon and McCartney found each other, if I could really hyperbolize.\n\n“Dead Reckoning” feels like it’s ramping up to bring full circle these ideas and themes that the series has been exploring since the very first film. Have there been callbacks or references that you particularly enjoyed being a part of?\n\nThe interesting thing about the initial phase of this story was that it was an eclectic showcase of separate directors, and then it morphed into something with greater continuity in terms of Chris and Tom’s collaboration. But Chris has always had a great understanding of the importance of the legacy, and so we have Henry Czerny back for this one, which is so cool to see Kittridge back, and Henry’s such a brilliant actor. And also, the acknowledgement of where Ethan came from, this idea that the IMF agents are kind of offered a choice, which is usually prison, death or joining the IMF. And we came up with Benji’s whole backstory, that he was a hacker in the UK who broke into a sensitive database in the US and got extradited to be tried criminally and then was offered the choice. And so they’re striving to move forward, but also the embracing of the history of it, I think really kind of singles this story out, I think, in franchise cinema.\n\nDoes Chris give you a sense of the road he’s mapping, or do you even need that at this point when you learn the details of, say, Benji’s origin story with the IMF?\n\nMcQ’s method of filmmaking is like in Wallace and Gromit’s “The Wrong Trousers” when Gromit is on the top of the train and he’s laying the track in front of the train as it’s moving. I think McQ loves to have the story reveal itself to him, and those beautiful little parallels and callbacks aren’t necessarily preordained — they just kind of present themselves. McQ’s really keen to evolve the story in a very organic way and never to cram anything in. If it feels right, we’ll do it. If it feels like it’s just fan service or it’s just some kind of tenuous link, which doesn’t quite ring true, then it won’t find its way in.\n\nOn the other hand, the movie pokes very gentle fun at the idea that the IMF team has gone rogue more than it simply just followed a mission. Have there been other tropes you felt it probably was time to actually admit to as opposed to just sweeping past that choice?\n\nI’m so glad they made the IMF joke in this because the International Monetary Fund has become more of a presence in the news, and it felt like it had to be addressed. But something like the mask gag, which is probably the most absurd thing in all “Mission: Impossible,” the idea that you could literally just immediately look like someone else, I love the fact that we utterly commit to that device in such a way that it rings true. I think if we ever went, wait a minute, how could you look so much like [that person]? It would spoil it. We are not a self-reflexive series. There’s a little bit of that occasionally when it’s required, but I think sometimes being arch reflects a lack of confidence in your own story. If you don’t have the confidence in the absurdity of your story, no one else is going to. And certainly with the mask gag, you’ve just got to commit.\n\nOne of the things that you do in this film is ride in a self-driving car. Why would Benji do that if it could be manipulated by The Entity?\n\nThat’s why he puts his seatbelt on. We had that thought, and we even spoke about the idea of The Entity hacking the car whilst Benji was in it. But I think he has to just do a Hail Mary and hope The Entity isn’t listening. I mean, fortunately, they’re using kind of analog comms, so with a bit of luck The Entity won’t be able to infiltrate the car. But I think it’s that moment of Benji thinking, you know what? I’m just going to pop on my belt, and that was our a way of saying, yes, we know.\n\nHow important are those plot redundancies? Is there a certain threshold where telling a story that’s exciting is more important than every single screw fitting into every little round hole?\n\nTom and McQ are incredibly meticulous with that kind of stuff. Obviously at times, just the sheer size of the story, the amount of characters, there are probably little holes that people can find, but we’ve always got a reason like that to explain stuff. But it is important to not just rely on people’s goodwill. I think you do have to try and cover every base as best you can, otherwise it’s just lazy. I get annoyed when I watch movies and things happen that just wouldn’t happen for whatever reason. And not necessarily great big fantasy films where you’re dealing with fantastic ideas, I don’t like it when characters do things they wouldn’t do just to facilitate a certain plot point. And I think McQ is really good at making sure that doesn’t happen with this.\n\nAfter returning to Benji so many times, what are you still learning about the character?\n\nWhat I love about McQ’s writing is that he’s always very true to the characters. Some people often say, “don’t you want to go and do that crazy stunt?” And it’s like, well, maybe, but would Benji do that kind of thing? He’s not Ethan. It’s Benji’s job to be the one that actually says, “What the fuck are we doing here?” Whereas Ethan’s got to be so focused, he can’t afford to take that pause. But I love the scene in this movie when Benji’s defusing the bomb and it’s starting to kind of grill him about his personal life. It’s both a heartwarming and sinister moment because it’s The Entity kind of drilling into Benji, but at the same time, you understand just how much Benji cares about who’s around him. That character stuff is the secret weapon, I think, of these films. People often make a lot of the stunts, obviously, because Tom’s doing incredibly daring stuff, but what Tom and McQ talk about the most is character, and that’s what they obsess about the most, that’s what they spend the most time working on, is making sure that the people involved in these moments of daring are people that you give a shit about. Because if you don’t, then those stunts will just be hollow.\n\nPart One feels very complete even though obviously Part Two is coming. How much have you filmed of Part Two and what has the flow been from one film to the next?\n\nWe’re not shooting in a pandemic, which means it’s not going to take quite as long as the last one did, which is a relief. I can tell you that we’ve already shot stuff which makes part one seem tame. To sit with an audience and watch Part One and know what’s coming, I feel this supreme sense of dramatic irony. It’s going to be extraordinary and surprising and also have the same degree of heart and character and attention to detail that Tom and McQ always bring."

        "text": "Celebrated writer Frederic Raphael has lashed out at Hollywood actor Tom Cruise , branding him an \"egocentric control freak.\" The renowned writer, known for his work on the 1999 film ' Eyes Wide Shut ,' expressed his grievances about his experience working with the late director Stanley Kubrick and criticized the chemistry between Cruise and his then-wife Nicole Kidman in the movie, despite them never having met.Raphael's scathing remarks were unveiled in a letter featured in his latest book, ' Last Post .' In the letter, he accused Tom Cruise, along with the director's wife, Christiane Harlan , and her brother Jan, of orchestrating an incessant campaign to downplay his contributions to the final version of 'Eyes Wide Shut.' The trio allegedly attempted to rewrite history and tarnish the writer's reputation by inserting derogatory content into his Wikipedia entry.The 91-year-old writer further lamented his inability to combat the libelous claims, citing a lack of modern skills and energy to do so. He decried the efforts to establish Cruise as the grand master of the film and expressed deep disappointment at being called a liar by individuals he had never even spoken to, including the Harlan clan and Tom Cruise. Raphael also made references to Cruise's involvement with Scientology, suggesting that it contributed to the actor's controlling behavior.Not stopping there, Raphael questioned Stanley Kubrick's judgment and motives in casting decisions for the film. He raised doubts about whether Kubrick admired Cruise's versatility or if he simply sought to get the best value for Warner Brothers ' money. The writer alluded to a strained working relationship between Kubrick and Cruise, implying that the actor was driven relentlessly to deliver for the studio.Moreover, Raphael criticized the director's choice to cast a real-life married couple, Cruise and Kidman, as an on-screen married couple, questioning the feasibility of portraying \"the truth\" about their relationship. He argued that public disclosures from conjugal duos rarely reveal the crucial aspects of their relationships.The writer's candid revelations have stirred up discussions about Hollywood's behind-the-scenes dynamics and the extent to which egos and control may impact artistic collaborations. However, Tom Cruise, Christiane Harlan, and Jan have yet to respond to these accusations, leaving the industry and fans wondering about the true nature of the working relationships during the making of 'Eyes Wide Shut.' As the controversy unfolds, Raphael's words serve as a reminder that even in the world of glitz and glamour, personal conflicts and power struggles can cast shadows on artistic endeavors."

        "text": "WASHINGTON — In the 2002 movie “Simone,” Al Pacino plays a director whose star, played by Winona Ryder, walks out on him after saying her trailer on set isn’t grand enough.\n\nDisgusted, Pacino’s character secretly creates an obedient computer-generated actress to replace his temperamental one. Simone is a perfect-looking blonde, named after the computer program that crafted her, Simulation One.\n\nBut Simone is so successful — lavished with Oscars, adored by fans — that she overshadows her director, who becomes jealous and gets rid of her with a computer virus. But he has made her so realistic, he is charged with her murder.\n\nBe careful what you wish for, Hollywood studios, as you mess with the primal force of A.I.\n\nTinseltown is going dark, as the actors join the writers on the picket line. Hollywood’s century-old business model was upended by Covid and also by streaming, which swept in like an occupying army. Then streaming hit a ceiling, and Netflix and Co. scrambled to pivot."

        "text": "Tom Cruise famously sends his friends in Hollywood a coconut cake every year for the holidays — but for his Mission: Impossible costars, the actor-producer is even more generous.\n\nCruise, 61, is back in theaters with the seventh installment in the hit action series, Dead Reckoning Part One, with many returning cast members (Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Vanessa Kirby and Rebecca Ferguson) as well as new ones (including Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff).\n\n\n\nAs one of the franchise's newcomers, Atwell, 41, tells PEOPLE she was especially touched by her costar's \"very thoughtful gifts.\"\n\nTIZIANA FABI/AFP via Getty\n\n\"I'm on my fourth Christmas cake,\" the English actress says. \"I've had a few birthdays as well because we've been working together nearly, what, over three and a half years now.\"\n\nFor one of her special days, she recalls receiving \"a beautiful amphora\" from Cruise, which she describes as \"this beautiful old clay pot, which is a natural filtering system.\"\n\n\"I'm like, 'It's a water jug. Nice,' \" she continues. \"And then you taste it and you compare it to normal filtered water or tap water, and it's really light and kind of creamy. It's just a different level of clarity. It's beautiful.\"\n\nParamount Pictures/Skydance\n\nKlementieff, who goes head-to-head with Cruise in Dead Reckoning as one of the film's villains, is also a fan of the coconut cake.\n\n\"I freeze it and then I eat it frozen, so I just eat it every day,\" she shares. \"That's what I did last year for Christmas. I started it when I got it and I ate it every morning, so I had a sugar rush. It was not good for my health, but it was delicious.\"\n\nAnother gift from Cruise was even more addictive.\n\n\"Another beautiful gift that was so thoughtful is that I wanted to skydive with him and also the stunt team, but they said that I needed to get my license,\" recalls the French actress, 37. \"So when I wrapped the movie, he gifted me, as my wrap gift, the lessons of learning how to skydive.\"\n\n\"He found a teacher for me and I learned how to skydive and I got my license and we even did jumps together. And now I'm addicted, so that's my new thing now!\"\n\nCourtesy of Paramount Pictures\n\nDespite having worked with Cruise since the third Mission: Impossible film in 2006, Pegg, 53, continues to be surprised with what his costar does for his cast.\n\n\"He's always very keen to show his appreciation,\" says Pegg. \"I think he's so used to being the focus of attention, it's naturally his instinct to kind of reflect everything back. And he's always incredibly sort of generous in terms of his gratitude to us and how he thanks us and how he lets us know that we're valued.\"\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nOne way Cruise showed his appreciation for his crew, as Pegg recalls, was taking the team shark-diving on a break from filming.\n\n\"We were filming somewhere near some coastal waters where there were sharks and we had the afternoon off and we all jumped,\" says Pegg.\n\n\"It's such a Tom Cruise thing. We've been filming in a helicopter and he flew us in the helicopter to this place where you could go into a cage and feed sharks. It was one of those days that we got to the end of the day and we were like, 'That was a real Tom Cruise kind of day.' \"\n\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is in theaters now.\n\n"

Credit: Paramount Pictures\n\n“It was mind-blowing,” said Klementieff, who plays an assassin called Paris in the flick.\n\nKirby, who is returning to the franchise as Alana Mitsopolis, added: “Everyone else was so nervous and fearful, and he wasn’t. I just thought it should have been the other way round.”\n\nHer co-star continued: “We stopped breathing when he was jumping.\n\nAdvert 10\n\n“And then someone would yell, ‘Canopy!’ you know, when the parachute opens, and we would all cheer and applaud.\n\n“And then he would do it again.”\n\nThat’s the problem with stuff like this – if you don’t get it all on the first go, you’ll just have to do it again.\n\nLoading…\n\nAdvert 10\n\nThis sort of stuff doesn’t seem to faze the 61-year-old Cruise, though.\n\nHe’s been training super hard for the film, and he’s been doing these films for decades now, too.\n\nIt has been reported that he performed more than 500 skydives and around 13,000 motocross bike jumps before finally going for a take.\n\nThat’s a lot of preparation, and very impressive dedication to he work.\n\nAdvert 10\n\nWhatever you might think about Cruise, he’s committed to what he does, and he definitely doesn’t do things by halves.\n\nThe blockbuster film was released on June 19 and is the seventh instalment in the Mission: Impossible franchise.\n\nThis takes some serious courage. Credit: Paramount Pictures\n\nHaving been delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, much like loads of other productions - not to mention just about everything else - the film has raked in around $226 million at the box office, and has broadly positive reviews.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 96 percent positive critical score, with an average rating of eight out of 10."

Photo / AP\n\nThe strike began after actors’ demands for higher wages and protections against artificial intelligence were not met in negotiations.\n\nThe A-list cast of Christopher Nolan’s epic Oppenheimer walked out of the movie’s UK premiere in London and Ryan Reynolds’ Deadpool 3 has also gone on hiatus.\n\nOppenheimer cast members including Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh were visibly emotional as they left the premiere early and Nolan said the cast had left to “write their picket signs”.\n\nSuccession star Brian Cox said the situation may cause Hollywood big hitters to “go to the brink”.\n\n“It’s a situation that can get really very unpleasant and could go on for some time,” the actor told Sky News.\n\nThe bulk of filming for part two of Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning has already been shot, with only some of the most extreme, and crucial, scenes yet to be filmed.\n\nDirector Christopher McQuarrie told Collider at the premiere of part one: “We’ve shot all but one of our international locations. We’ve shot our big action except for the biggest set piece, the central set piece of the film, which is massive and unlike anything we’ve done and, I think, unlike anything you’ve seen.”\n\nIt’s another blow for the franchise, which faced setbacks while trying to film the first instalment, which was constantly pushed back by the Covid pandemic.\n\nNow all of Hollywood is set to halt as unions ordered members to down tools during the long-standing row that could delay the release of blockbusters across the globe.\n\nThe latest Deadpool instalment, starring Ryan Reynolds, has also halted production. Photo / Supplied\n\nThe actors’ strike centres on a dispute over compensation, especially in light of an industry-wide shift towards streaming that has changed the way performers receive residuals or royalty payments.\n\nProtections for actors from AI are also on the negotiation table due to advancements in technology causing fears within the industry.\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "\"Bro is a generational crush,\" said a user.\n\nAmerican actor Tom Cruise is one of the most admired celebrities across the globe. Fans and supporters of such celebrities make numerous efforts to meet them- some travel across the globe to catch a glimpse while others wait for them in hotel lobbies or outside restaurants for long hours. In one such instance, a woman recently got to meet her crush, Tom Cruise, at the premiere of 'Mission Impossible 7'. She shared a video on Instagram where she spoke to the actor and told him about the same. Hearing this, Mr Cruise had the funniest reply. His response is going viral on social media and the internet cannot get enough of it.\n\nThe video was shared by a user who goes by the handle @grace_trx on Instagram. In the video, she is seen greeting the actor. She then tells the actor that 30 years ago her mother told her father that she has a crush on Tom Cruise. Later, she tells him that it's not only her mom, but she has a crush on the actor too. Hearing this, Mr Cruise jokingly said, \"I hope your dad's ok with that.\"\n\n\"Had the sweetest moment with @tomcruise at his Mission Impossible 7 premiere on Monday. If you know me, you'll know how much this means to me because I've loved him as an actor and his movies since high school. The undivided attention to listen to my story, him reaching out to squeeze my hand gently - he made me feel like I was the only person there.He also came back to me to check that I took the perfect photo of us, after he had already moved on to other fans.

        "text": "Whether motorcycling off a cliff in Dead Reckoning, scaling the exterior of the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Ghost Protocol or dangling from a helicopter in Fallout, Tom Cruise is famous for doing his own stunts in his visually breathtaking Mission: Impossible films.\n\nHe's a Hollywood star who has always made clear that he believes that audiences would much rather see actors themselves rather than any computerised digital jiggery-pokery when it comes to performing action sequences.\n\nAnd it was his passion for authenticity that saw Cruise intervene last week in the dispute between actors and film producers over new artificial intelligence (AI) technology that, in theory, could mean he never has to do another stunt again and audiences would never know the difference.\n\nThe entertainment industry bible, The Hollywood Reporter, states that, in the run-up to the Hollywood actors and writers strike, the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) recruited him to help voice their fears over the use of AI by the studios and streaming giants.\n\nIt was his passion for authenticity that saw Cruise (pictured with Hayley Atwell) intervene last week in the dispute between actors and film producers over new artificial intelligence (AI) technology that, in theory, could mean he never has to do another stunt again and audiences would never know the difference\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter, states that, in the run-up to the Hollywood actors and writers strike, the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) recruited him to help voice their fears over the use of AI by the studios and streaming giants. Pictured: Olivia Wilde\n\nAI lies at the heart of the strike that has brought Hollywood to a standstill. Battles over pay and healthcare are certainly part of the dispute but the unions claim 'generative' AI actually poses an existential threat to film and TV as we know it.\n\nThey say it could be used by studios to replace actors and professional stuntmen and women by making it look as if the actors are performing when they are not. It could be used to bring long-dead stars 'back to life' to play roles in modern films. And, astonishingly, it's widely predicted that AI programs will one day be able to create digitally the entire cast for a film. All of it so much cheaper than using real people.\n\nFran Drescher, president of the 160,000-member SAG-AFTRA union, has bluntly warned: 'We are all going to be in jeopardy of being replaced by machines.'\n\nIs this all Tinseltown hyperbole? Experts say not. AI really could make huge numbers of screen actors obsolete — which explains why Tom Cruise is not the only celebrity involved in this fight.\n\nAmong many others are his co-star in Dead Reckoning, Hayley Atwell, and Succession star Brian Cox, who joined a demonstration in London last week by the British actors' union Equity.\n\nHollywood writers, who were the first to strike, also fear that AI will replace them — that digital entities could soon be delivering polished scripts created by computer. Popular AI programs such as ChatGPT don't seem able to produce a convincing film script — but experts say that will change.\n\nAnd in the meantime, the technology is churning out film plots and ideas, while some screenwriters complain that they are being offered insultingly cheap rates to clean up sub-par AI-created scripts rather than produce original ones themselves.\n\nBut if the threat to film writers seems obvious to anyone who has ever tinkered for five minutes with ChatGPT, industry experts say the AI revolution ultimately poses a far more serious menace to those who appear on the screen. And particularly to the massed ranks of actors whose names you will never recognise.\n\nThe principal issue surrounding AI for the unions is that it has potentially calamitous implications for the rank-and-file 'extras' (known in the U.S. as background actors) who constitute the vast majority of the profession in Hollywood. They are not famous and scratch out a living, working for modest day rates and never knowing one week to the next whether they will have work.\n\nThese are the people who have made up crowd scenes and even armies in epic productions — actors we have all taken for granted for decades. Their jobs are under threat as never before.\n\nFor AI can create and manipulate digital images of these actors so they can be replicated again and again in film after film.\n\nIn other words, you could be hired to appear in a crowd scene in a new adaptation of Pride And Prejudice only to reappear in the background in a Star Wars movie, a Game Of Thrones sequel and possibly — if you're sufficiently photogenic — in a new Barbie film.\n\nAI took 40 years off Harrison Ford for flashback scenes in the new Indiana Jones film, Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez joins the picket line as the SAG-AFTRA Actors Union Strike continues in front of Netflix on July 24\n\nThe Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) — which represents major film studios, big U.S. TV networks and streaming giants — claims it has offered the actors 'groundbreaking' guarantees on AI which will safeguard performers' digital images, and include a requirement for their consent 'for the creation and use of digital replicas or for digital alterations of a performance'.\n\nThe actors' union counters that these guarantees are worthless and that the Hollywood giants actually propose that extras should accept a day's pay in return for their pictures being taken and scanned by a studio. The latter would then be able to use that image in every film or programme they liked 'for the rest of eternity'.\n\nBut as Tom Cruise's involvement in the strike illustrates, it is not just jobbing actors who are affected. Top stars also feel threatened, even though, to date, some of AI's most obvious on-screen applications relating to them have been benign, such as knocking decades off the ages of Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci in the 2019 Martin Scorsese gangster film The Irishman.\n\nCritics complained that the technology used in The Irishman was far from perfect and the stars looked weird. However, AI continues to improve rapidly and the on-screen result becomes ever more convincing.\n\nIt took 40 years off Harrison Ford for flashback scenes in the new Indiana Jones film, Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny.\n\nFord, 81, said he was delighted with his digital facelift. 'That is my actual face at that age,' he explained on a U.S. chatshow. 'They have this artificial intelligence program. It can go through every foot of film that Lucasfilm owns because I did a bunch of movies for them and they have all this footage including film that wasn't printed — stock.\n\n'They could mine it from where the light is coming from, the expression. But that's my actual face. Then I put little dots on my face and I say the words and they make it. It's fantastic.'\n\nAI magic also gave Val Kilmer his voice back for the 2022 blockbuster Top Gun: Maverick after he developed throat cancer in his 50s, taking away his natural speaking voice.\n\nThe technology was used, too, to recreate the facial expressions of actor Josh Brolin on the ugly mug features of Marvel supervillain Thanos.\n\nDirectors are being encouraged by galloping AI developments to be ever more ambitious with it.\n\nThe forthcoming drama Here, due out next year and starring Tom Hanks and Robin Wright playing younger versions of themselves, uses a new AI program called Metaphysic Live to de-age and 'face-swap' the actors in real time as they perform rather than later in the post production stage.\n\nThe film's director, Robert Zemeckis, has boasted that the technology will allow the film to do things that were 'previously impossible'. All these actors mentioned above, however, gave their permission for the AI engineers to get to work on them.\n\nThis wasn't the case when Tom Cruise and Keanu Reeves were separately the unwitting subjects of cleverly made and highly convincing 'deepfake' videos which went viral on social media, and which were created by AI algorithms. Bruce Willis was also 'deepfaked' into Russian telecoms commercials. Reeves, who ironically battled against an AI world created by a malign super-computer in the Matrix films, described the deepfake experience as 'scary', and is worried about its effects in Hollywood.\n\nMembers of SAG-AFTRA and WGA go on strike at Netflix, Sunset Gower and Paramount Studios on July 21\n\nREAD MORE HERE: What films and TV shows will the Hollywood strike shut down? How British viewers' favourite programmes will be affected by actor walkout Advertisement\n\nHe has revealed that he has had a clause put in his contracts to prevent the digital manipulation of any of his performances. Insiders suspect that other stars have done the same.\n\nBefore he died in 2014, Robin Williams made a legal stipulation that his image couldn't be used in any future film for 25 years after his death.\n\nKeanu Reeves has also flagged up the enormous financial appeal that the technology has to employers — as well as its threat to actors, and how creativity will be sacrificed for profit.\n\n'The people who are paying you for your art would rather not pay you,' he said in an interview a few months ago.\n\n'They're actively seeking a way around you.'\n\nSusan Sarandon, star of Thelma & Louise and currently joining the Hollywood strikers' pickets, is another actor who has voiced concerns about AI, saying it could make her 'say and do things I have no choice about'.\n\nAnd there are other ethical issues over the use of AI to recreate actors who are dead.\n\nIn 2021, a documentary about the late chef and TV personality Anthony Bourdain came in for criticism when its makers re-created his voice but failed to say whether they had got his permission to do so before he unexpectedly died.\n\nDisney used AI to put Carrie Fisher, alias Princess Leia, in the 2019 Star Wars spinoff The Rise Of Skywalker even though she had died three years earlier.\n\nThe inclusion, adapted unused footage from an earlier film, reportedly had the blessing of her daughter, actress Billie Lourd, but who can be certain that Fisher herself would have agreed?\n\nAt least asking her permission was an option, which was never the case with The Andy Warhol Diaries, a 2022 Netflix TV series which recreated the voice of the artist who died in 1987.\n\nAmerica's National Association of Voice Actors has called for stronger AI regulation, saying it is becoming ever harder to detect when synthesised voices are replacing real ones.\n\nAI has very much exposed the moral issue of what rights individuals — including celebrities — have after they die.\n\nActors may dream of cinematic immortality but critics question whether the stars of Hollywood would be nearly so keen if it simply meant coming back as a digital clone. Film-makers are now on to their second attempt to resurrect James Dean, who died aged just 24 in a car accident in 1955 after starring in just three films.\n\nA 2019 feature film, Finding Jack, was cancelled but he has since been 'cast' in upcoming movie Back To Eden, a sci-fi film in which his walking, talking digital character will interact on screen with real actors on screen.\n\nAs Tom Hanks has pointed out, 'I could be hit by a bus tomorrow and that's it, but my performances can go on and on and on.'\n\nSome in Hollywood fear that all this AI-enabled nostalgia and virtual resurrections will also stop producers bothering to find new talent.\n\nOne only need look at this summer's blockbusters at the cinema and streaming — starring the likes of Ford, Cruise, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Denzel Washington and Pierce Brosnan — to see the continuing appeal of older stars.\n\nA recent poll of people of all ages found 19 of the top 20 movie stars people most want to see are over 40. How much more appealing would a 60-something actor be if he can be made to be 30-something again?\n\nAnd if at 61 Tom Cruise can still 'speed fly' — running headlong off a Lake District cliff wearing only a parachute for his latest film — what might we see him do in the future looking 21 again?"

        "text": "Does Tom Cruise ever worry — as you might on occasion — that maybe he shouldn’t have eaten something past its sell-by date? Who could ever say or know? He’s not a movie star you identify with or empathize with. You simply get out of his way.\n\nMission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One is another colossal but expertly engineered vehicle, like 2022’s Top Gun: Maverick, that knows exactly how to deliver the maximum Tom Cruise experience. Two hours and 36 minutes long, Reckoning spends too much time on expository blather, but you can just tune that all out as you watch Cruise being put through his paces (and his paces are faster and better than yours) in two phenomenal action scenes.\n\nOne is a breathless, battering car chase through the streets of Rome (partly in a tiny yellow Fiat). The other, even better, involves a train barreling out of control while Cruise, holding onto a motorcycle for dear life, plunges down toward the rogue choo-choo from a high, high cliff. If you have vertigo, it's a potential barf-bag moment.\n\nCourtesy of Paramount Pictures\n\nAccording to production notes, Cruise rehearsed for this particular stunt by completing more than 500 skydives and 13,000 motocross jumps. That probably answers the question about whether he worries about sell-by dates.\n\nIn the course of Dead Reckoning, number 7 in the M:I franchise, Cruise’s agent Ethan Hunt suffers some genuine sorrow — he all but clutches his heart after one key twist — and even loses his cool, but mostly he sizes up every situation with that same wily, cocky Tom Cruise look, as if he could outplay and outfox doomsday itself. Which, actually, is Ethan’s assignment here: His new enemy is a near-omniscient AI program — nameless, faceless and (one hopes) odorless — that basically wants to hack the entire world. It’s so colossal a threat, Dead Reckoning will spill over into a second installment in June 2024.\n\nHayley Atwell is the major new addition to the franchise. She plays Grace, a thief who keeps trying to steal a key — part of a key — that’s crucial to stopping the AI nemesis. If you admired the gravity and intelligence that this British actress brought to the ABC Marvel series Agent Carter or to STARZ’s adaptation of Howards End, you may be puzzled by her first, flirtatious scenes with Cruise: She’s glossy and empty-eyed, with a faint smile on her lips. She looks as hollow-headed as a Team America puppet.\n\nHowever, she’s giving precisely the one-to two-note performance that’s required here — the same could be said for returning players Vanessa Kirby, arrogant and kittenish as Alanna (she occasionally crinkles her nose), and Rebecca Ferguson, noble and watchful as Ilisa. Anything more would distract from the bold, cold mechanisms of the action. Their performances all interlock and flow with the narrative seamlessly, unlike Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s more idiosyncratic performance in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.\n\nChristian Black/Paramount Pictures\n\nAs summer action blockbusters go, for that matter, Reckoning is certainly the more impressive of the two movies: Harrison Ford’s return was like a gift from an old friend making a surprise visit out of the dusty past — if his gift had gotten a bit banged up from all that time in the saddle bag and the wrapping paper was torn, so be it. Cruise is more like some new form of man rocketing in from the future, combining a primal will to survive with a gleaming indestructibility. He’s like the evolutionary union of Bear Grylls and Buzz Lightyear.\n\nIn the long run, neither of these films deserves to be as well-remembered (or taken as seriously) as the year’s third ginormous action fantasy, John Wick: Chapter 4, a dreamlike quest for both redemption and death in which Keanu Reeves, his dank black hair framing his face like a broken-winged raven, serves as the tale’s woeful knight. It’s the martial-arts equivalent of The Lord of the Rings.\n\nAt the moment, though, Tom Cruise is running in a straight line down the middle of a long air-terminal rooftop, pumping his arms like a windup toy. No one will catch him. Only an idiot would try.\n\nIn theaters July 12, rated PG-13\n\n\n\n"

It becomes invasive.”\n\nAtwell confessed she sought counsel from the iconic superstar, who has been a magnet for rumors throughout most of his career. The “Risky Business” actor offered some sage advice, she said.\n\n“When I’ve talked to him about it, he’d be like, ‘You know exactly who you are. You know what you’re about. And that is the only thing that matters. It doesn’t matter what people think of you, if you are in integrity with yourself, if you know what your value system is,’ ” Atwell said.\n\nFor the seventh “M.I.” Atwell portrays a master thief and possible romantic partner for IMF agent Ethan Hunt, played by Cruise since 1996.\n\nThe Golden Globe Award nominee previously starred as Peggy Carter in six Marvel movies, most notably 2022′s “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.”\n\n“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One ″ arrives in theaters Wednesday.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n« Previous\n\nNext »"

        "text": "Tom Cruise really wants you to go see Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. And Barbie. And Oppenheimer.\n\nDespite his own blockbuster opening in a few weeks (that would be Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One), Cruise is urging his fans to check out the summer movie competition.\n\n“This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters,” Cruise wrote on Instagram post (below) that showed him standing with his Dead Reckoning writer-director Christopher McQuarrie in front of posters for Indy 5. “These are just a few that we can’t wait to see on the big screen.”\n\n“Congratulations, Harrison Ford, on 40 years of Indiana Jones and creating one of the most iconic characters in cinema history,” he continued. “You have given us countless hours of joy.”\n\n“I love a double feature, and it doesn’t get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig’s Barbie.”\n\nThe messaging suggests Cruise is once again hoping to save the summer box office — this time by bringing along a few other titles.\n\nLast year, the massive success of Top Gun: Maverick (which made $1.5 billion globally) was credited as “saving Hollywood’s ass” by no less than Steven Spielberg himself.\n\nThis year, a few films have struggled to gain box office traction — such as The Flash and Elemental — though Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse successfully popped.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is facing headwinds with modest reviews, yet is tracking to open with a solid $60 million to $70 million over the June 30-July 2 weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, Dead Reckoning is headed toward a franchise-best $90 million opening for its extended weekend, which gets underway Wednesday, July 12.\n\nThere’s no tracking yet for Barbie or Oppenheimer, which open head-to-head July 21, but both are considered highly anticipated — though, with respect to Cruise, would likely make for a rather odd back-to-back viewing experience.\n\nThe move follows a viral report from Puck that a “pissed” Cruise was had loudly complained to Paramount executives about the impact of Oppenheimer’s IMAX deal. Cruise was reportedly upset that IMAX was going to boot Dead Reckoning from its large-format screens after just one week in order to make room for its prior commitment to run Oppenheimer — which was entirely shot in the IMAX format – for three weeks.\n\n— Pamela McClintock contributed to this report"

Perry\n\nGROWING UP, Greg Davis was a wild child. “My family used to say I was bad,” says Davis, “but I say I had a lot of energy!” With all that energy and long, curly hair down to his back that he later styled into dreads, he got the nickname “Tarzan” from his family. It’s since become his middle name in his credits as an actor in action films like Top Gun: Maverick and this summer’s Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One.\n\nShooting back-to-back projects with Tom Cruise requires every ounce of that Tarzan energy, something Davis knew from the grueling prep for Maverick, during which he withstood up to eight g’s of force and underwent intensive swim training. This time, a mere two weeks after he got the call for Mission: Impossible, Davis was on set—the “set” being a mountaintop in Norway—waiting to watch Cruise shoot a stunt involving a cliffside motorcycle BASE jump. “Tom flies over us hanging off the end of a helicopter, gets to the edge of the cliff, and just jumps off,” he says. “And that was his warmup for the actual stunt!”\n\nDavis—who spent his youth dabbling in football, basketball, baseball, track, and tae kwon do—found kindred spirits and mentors in Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie. They all share a similar can’t-stop-won’t-stop attitude. But Davis knows how to relax, too, like on a trip to Jamaica last summer. “I’m a pool guy,” he says. “And I do enjoy swimming, now that I’ve learned from Top Gun.”\n\nAt a tucked away booth at the Heimat Fitness Concept Club in Los Angeles, where Davis had just wrapped a Men's Health photoshoot sporting the summer's most versatile shorts and shirts—get the look below!—he described his wild first day on set with Cruise for Mission: Impossible, how the movies pull their intense stunts together, and why he hopes we never see the unreleased footage of the now-iconic Maverick football beach scene.\n\nBar Stars: These Gucci vintage-inspired swim shorts are made of breathable, fast-drying nylon.

Andre L. Perry\n\nMen's Health: Your father is a boxer and so is one of your brothers, but you've taken up a lot of sports and types of exercise over the years. What's been your exercise of choice to get into Mission: Impossible shape?\n\nGreg Tarzan Davis: Boxing is currently is my exercise of choice. For Mission: Impossible, I did a lot of physical training that required me to learn different techniques, so I've taken up kickboxing on top of boxing. I mean, it's Mission: Impossible—it's an action film to the biggest degree. We do all our own stunts because that's what you do with Tom Cruise, and there are sequences where my character shows a background in martial arts. Something I think is so cool about this film is that each character has their own specific fighting style or way of moving. Rebecca [Ferguson] has more more of fluid style of fighting, whereas I have more of a brute force style, and Tom has his own style, which we all saw in the amazing Mission: Impossible—Fallout bathroom fight scene. So if you go back and watch all the Mission: Impossible movies, you'll see that each character has developed their own physicality.\n\nTom Cruise is known for going hard in his movies, whether it's for stunts or fight scenes or chase sequences. Did you feel a lot of pressure to keep up?\n\nThere's no pressure necessarily. But you're always thinking, What is he going to have me do next? But he's so good at preparing you for what you're about to take on. So I've never been scared because I've been so prepared. He sets up all these training regimens in order for you to be able to do what you need to do. My training consistent of martial arts, weapons training, skydiving, drifting, motorcycle riding, and flying planes. It was like a crash course of every wild thing you can do in an action movie.\n\nChilling Out: Thorsun’s classic Americana swim shorts can dry in a Miami minute.

Andre L. Perry\n\nThis is your first Mission: Impossible movie. What was your first impression when you got on set?\n\nOkay, so, the stunts that we have in this movie are insane. The motorcycle stunt is insane. And to see it in person is really insane. I went to set every day, even when I wasn't working, because I was shadowing McQ. I want to learn from him and Tom. They've been great mentors, teaching me all the intricate details of how things work, whether it's on set or in the editing room.\n\nOn top of that, we're all always on set when there's a big stunt. So I remember on the very first day, we were in Norway, filming on top of a mountain cliff. I asked how we were going to get to set, and they said, \"Oh, a helicopter.\" So they send everybody to the top of the mountain by helicopter. It's me, Haley Atwell, Simon Pegg, Pom Klementieff, Shea Whigham. We get up to the top of this mountain, and everyone is setting up for Tom to do a BASE jump off the cliff. So I asked, \"Where's Tom?\" Then Tom flies over us hanging off the end of a helicopter, gets to the edge of the cliff, and just jumps off. And that was his warmup for the actual stunt!\n\nPool to Table: Not your dad’s chino shorts: These Vuori unlined, stretchy, loose-fitting swim trunks can handle all day at the pool and moonlight as a dressier look in the evening.

Andre L. Perry\n\nWere there any sequences that you had to hype yourself up for?\n\nMy first day of shooting was actually to shoot my big stunt. I was like, \"Damn, so this is how you ease people into the world of Mission: Impossible?\" When you're shooting stunts at these great heights, there's something that kicks in, that happens in your mind: you just don't want to fall. So you have to fight the urge to hang on for dear life. You have to look cool! You have to look like this is something you do all the time. In one particular shot, I lost my shoe and it just fell out of sight. I thought, That could have been me! Goddamn! Then I had to shoot the rest of the scene without a shoe. There was nothing we could do. The cameraman just had to try to hide my bare foot. It was a weird shot. But I couldn't stop the whole production to go get my shoe. You keep going, you get something, and you see what they can do with it. It was the same kind of thing with Maverick. You're up there in a cockpit by yourself, and you have to get the shot. You want to use every second available to you.\n\nQuad Goals: These sporty lined swim shorts from Brooks Brothers are great for swimming, running, playing pickleball—you name it. They’re made with 10 percent spandex and have a roomy thigh fit so you can really move as you kick, stretch, or squat. The five-inch inseam also shows off your summer quads.

Perry\n\nTom and director McQ have made a lot of these movies over the years and developed their own approach to creating big action movie tentpoles. What was the process of creating a Mission: Impossible movie?\n\n\n\nSo I got my first actual, full script for Mission: Impossible two weeks before I wrapped the film. Izzy, the AD, came to my trailer and she said, \"Hey, I have a gift for you!\" And she handed me this big old printed script. But during most of the filming, you get pages throughout the process. When you're shooting scenes with dialogue and you get the script for those scenes the night before, you have to adjust quickly and you have to trust McQ and Tom. But they also have to trust us. I think it's incredible that they have so much faith in their actors to handle an unorthodox process, to be able to adapt, and to make the most of the freedom you get to help create your character and contribute. And I will say that Simon and Rebecca were also great at helping usher us in to the Mission way. We would go into a scene, we would do something, and McQ would say, \"That's really good. Do more of that.\" Then the next day, he would come to you and say, \"That thing you did yesterday, we were watching dailies, and we loved it and now we're doing this new thing with your character.\" And I'd seen this in Maverick too. My part was basically a background character, but I did one thing in one scene and they said, \"Okay, let's give him more.\" So I was able to understand the process going into Mission.\n\nSpeaking of Maverick, it would be journalistic malpractice not to ask you about the beach football scene. What was it like to shoot that and try to live up to the beach volleyball scene in the original Top Gun?\n\nThat was an intense time. We killed ourselves for that beach scene because we knew how important it was, and how many people love the iconic volleyball scene from the first Top Gun. So we starved and worked out three times a day. We were angry campers—hangry campers.\n\nThen we found out two weeks after we shot the scene—after everybody had just pigged out—that we had to shoot the scene again. So then we had to go through an expedited version of preparations. It was terrible!\n\nGet the Look: ($68) by Fair Harbor; ($1,389) by Frost NYC. Andre L. Perry\n\nWell, the results speak for themselves: the scene was so popular that last Christmas, Paramount+ looped the scene into a three hour yule log-style video for the holidays. Is there any more footage that you're holding out on us?\n\nOh, there's a lot of the footage that we did not want to put out from the beach scene in Maverick—out in fear of embarrassment!\n\nWhy was it so embarrassing?\n\nThere's just one shot of all of us, oiled up, shirtless, doing the most erotic dances on the tarmac before even going to the beach. We're not even on the beach yet! It started out with us all just working out, and someone started playing some music, so we all started getting into it. And suddenly there's this raunchy Magic Mike moment happening on the tarmac of a naval base. Someone still has the footage! But we were supposed to be these hotshot pilots, so I'm pretty sure the studio just couldn't put out a lot of the content that they recorded. And I am thankful for that!\n\nThis interview has been condensed for content and clarity."

        "text": "Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part 2 is still being filmed as we speak according to the movie's director. Christopher McQuarrie was interviewed by Collider's Steve Weintraub during the movie's worldwide premiere. As for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part 2, a lot of the international locations are done. But, the biggest set piece at the heart of the movie is still left to hammer out. The creative team is already teasing the absolute scale of that one. McQuarrie also mentioned that there are some surprises waiting for fans in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part 2. Characters that didn't appear in the first installment, action sequences for the whole team, and much more. Check out what he had to say here.\n\nMcQuarrie began, \"We've shot all but one of our international locations. We've shot our big action except for the biggest set piece, the central set piece of the film, which is massive and unlike anything we've done, and, I think, unlike anything you've seen.\"\n\n\"All the interstitial stuff is shot. There are characters in the movie you don't even know about yet. And I have one—how would I call it? It's a sidebar action sequence involving the team, which we haven't shot yet, and that's first up as soon as we get back,\" he continued. \"It's involving elements that I've never worked with before. It's a big challenge, and it's a tight schedule. The plan to be wrapped for all principal photography is early next year.\"\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One Brings the Stunts\n\nIt's no secret that these big stunts have become the lifeblood of the Mission: Impossible brand. No one is driving that truck, or in this case motorcycle, harder than Tom Cruise. Comicbook.com's Brandon Davis spoke to McQuarrie about the hair-raising bike stunt in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part 1. The push to keep going bigger is keeping the director very busy.\n\n\"There's not a chicken, there's not an egg,\" McQuarrie explained. \"Sometimes we start with...like, Fallout started with the emotional story of Ethan and Julia, and the stunts were kind of put around in the periphery. The beginning of this one, I said, 'What do you want to do?' He said, 'I want to ride a motorcycle off a cliff. What do you want to do?' And I said, 'I want to wreck a train. Let's just wreck a train.' Of course, both of us at one point or another would remind the other, 'You know, this was your idea. You wanted to do this.' Tom was very fortunate in one respect becuase he got his stunt out of the way day one. I'm still shooting that train. That just took forever, and it was very, very challenging.\"\n\nChristopher McQuarrie Knows The Weight of the Mission: Impossible Brand\n\n(Photo: Paramount Pictures)\n\nWorking in these big franchises can be a little tough. McQuarrie told Total Film that the realization came through very clear working on Top Gun: Maverick. It seems like people care about these long-established characters more than ever. So, the pressure is there, but the filmmaker feels like the team can meet that expectation.\n\n\"I don't take my position for granted. I don't take the audience's participation for granted. When we were making Top Gun: Maverick, I didn't take for granted that people loved that movie or that it was a 35-year-old cultural institution. I looked at it with a very suspicious and cynical eye towards Hollywood's tendency to make it a cash grab,\" McQuarrie said. \"So, everything I do is to constantly check myself and remind myself that it does not matter what you did before, this is the one you're doing now. I'm terrified of the result of Dead Reckoning, which lives in the shadow of Fallout, which lives in the shadow of Rogue [Nation], and Ghost [Protocol], and all the other movies that came before it. I don't want to let the franchise down. I'm more frightened now than I was on my first Mission.\"\n\nHow Do We Get To Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two?\n\nTom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, which premieres in theaters on July 12th. It's the beginning of the end for the action-packed franchise, as Cruise reteams with longtime collaborator and filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie for more death-defying and breathtaking stunts. Hunt and allies Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) attempt to track down a new weapon with the power to tear the world apart. Actors Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, and Esai Morales join the cast for the latest installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise, which is set to wrap up with Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two.\n\nAre you amped to see Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One?

Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One is already in theaters, and it was released to some of the best reactions of the year for a blockbuster movie. Not only is Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One one of the best-reviewed films of the year, it's actually the highest-rated Tom Cruise film of all time, and that's saying a lot for one of the last movie stars. The film seems to have it all going for it. Stunts, action, and a hell of a plot But one of the things it doesn't have is Angela Bassett. According to a new interview with Variety, director Christopher McQuarrie revealed what Bassett's role could have been in Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One and even teased her return in Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part Two.\n\n\"It was interesting,\" McQuarrie said in a recent interview with the trade. \"She was going to be the head of the CIA. She would have been in that room with all the other heads of the intelligence community and, uh, we're not done with Angela Bassett. Angela is too fabulous. You could never ever let Angela get away. There's always a plan in the future.\"\n\nWhat happens in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One?\n\nTom Cruise is back as the iconic action hero Ethan Hunt in the seventh installment, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, which is set to make its way into theaters next week.

        "text": "Tom Cruise has done it again. And again. And once more. And it probably won’t be the last time that he risks his life to achieve the best scenes for one of his favorite series: Mission Impossible. So much so that Paramount Pictures has shared a new making-of trailer in which we see good old Tom paragliding surrounded by cameras, thus achieving one of the riskiest and most spectacular sequences in the actor’s already long career. This is how they filmed the so called “Speedflying” scene for Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning - Part 1.\n\nTom Cruise and his riskiest scenes\n\nThus, after the famous motorcycle jump off a cliff, we now see how Tom Cruise stars in a new action scene executed by himself, without doubles, without cheating or tricks. So much so, that Cruise trained for hours and hours to learn how to paraglide down an impressive mountainside, including sharp turns at full speed to end up landing in the lowest part of the valley that served as the setting for this new feat.\n\nWe’ll have to wait and see what context this new scene is situated in which the actor, instead of leaving these activities to the stuntmen, stars in the entire stunt himself, jumping from the top of a mountain without qualms. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning - Part 1 aims to become one of the most visually spectacular installments of the franchise, which is no small thing.\n\nFull screen Aston Martin's Canadian driver Lance Stroll competes in the qualifying session at the Red Bull race track in Spielberg, Austria on June 30, 2023, ahead of the Austrian Formula One Grand Prix.

        "text": "Tom Cruise has been one of the most recognizable stars in Hollywood for, literally, my entire life. The original Top Gun (1986) came out nearly 10 years before I was born (1995), so I’ve never known a Hollywood landscape without Tom Cruise playing a major part in it. But somewhere in the 2010s it felt like Cruise had entered his “just a guy” era. Movies like Jack Reacher, Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, and The Mummy all made technically decent money. But nothing that jumped off the page to say that Tom Cruise was a big box office draw anymore. Maybe after a couple decades of being a huge star, the big Cinematic Universe machine had finally passed him by. Or so we might have thought. Looking at it now, though, with the trio of Fallout, Top Gun: Maverick, and now Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part 1 in the past few years, Tom Cruise has proven that not only is he still, at age 61, a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood but he is THE force. Dead Reckoning Part 1 confirms what we’ve known. Tom Cruise has no peers today as a movie star.\n\nMission Impossible Dead Reckoning Synopsis\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Recoking Part One Official Trailer\n\nIn Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team embark on their most dangerous mission yet: To track down a terrifying new weapon that threatens all of humanity before it falls into the wrong hands. With control of the future and the fate of the world at stake, and dark forces from Ethan’s past closing in, a deadly race around the globe begins. Confronted by a mysterious, all-powerful enemy, Ethan is forced to consider that nothing can matter more than his mission – not even the lives of those he cares about most.\n\nUpping the Stakes\n\nAs the 7th film in the Mission: Impossible franchise, and following up the most successful film in the series to date, Dead Reckoning looks to heighten the stakes in every way for Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt. Obviously the fate of the world being on the line isn’t new territory for a movie like this. But Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part 1 weaves a thrilling, if a bit contrived, web of a story about a complicated AI weapon that feels especially timely given *waves hands vaguely* everything. While it’d be easy for a story about world-eating artificial intelligence to feel completely detached from real human stakes, Dead Reckoning does a great job of giving viewers plenty of characters to latch onto.\n\nHayley Atwell hangs with Tom Cruise every step of the way in Dead Reckoning\n\nA Strong Supporting Cast\n\nThe stakes are a testament to the performances as well. You already know what Tom Cruise brings to the table. But beyond that, the supporting cast members, especially series newcomers and MCU-alumnae Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff, are all well-aware of what movie they’re in and they provide the perfect amount of bad-ass sexy international criminal energy that a movie like this needs. Obviously no one is going to catch an Oscar nomination for their work here. But in order for a movie like Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning to work, there can be no weak links in the action or the dialogue that take away from how cool everything and everyone you’re seeing on screen are. And I’m happy to report that there are no weak links here.\n\nDead Reckoning‘s main villain Gabriel (Esai Morales) is equally off-putting, dangerous, and kinda hot. Gabriel is the scariest possible manifestation of the AI/Crypto bros we’ve all come to despise on Twitter. He’s a fanatic who follows the AI unflinchingly to the point it’s become his God. And as annoying as that could have been, Morales makes it work by being fascinating to watch. Morales actually does what Rami Malek was trying to do in No Time To Die with the slow-talking heavy accent thing.\n\nEsai Morales plays a fantastic villain in Gabriel\n\nTom Cruise Stands Alone\n\nUltimately, as good as the supporting cast and the plot are, that’s not why we’re here. As the great philosopher of our time Nicole Kidman said, we come to this place for MAGIC. And for the past few years, no one in Hollywood has single-handedly provided us with more movie magic than Tom Cruise.\n\nSay whatever you want to about the Church of Scientology, or jumping on Oprah’s couch, or whatever thing you might want to knock Tom Cruise for. But at the end of the day, who am I to deny this man who has consistently risked both life and limb, purely for my entertainment, his rightful due?\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One | The Biggest Stunt in Cinema History (Tom Cruise)\n\nWhether it’s jumping out of an airplane, climbing the world’s tallest building, or doing a motorcycle jump off a mountain, we know that Tom Cruise lives and breathes for this shit. I don’t know why he does it. Maybe he has a death wish. Maybe he’s had a mid-life crisis. Perhaps he’s wanted to do all of this stuff forever and he’s just now finding a way to make other people pay for it. I don’t care why. What I do care about is that every second of Tom Cruise doing cool shit on screen, and there’s a lot of that in Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part 1, feels authentic and spell-binding. At my screening, you could feel the entire theater shifting to the edge of their seats for stunts. You could hear the child-like glee and amazement of grown adults who just watched Tom Cruise do the craziest shit they’d ever seen.\n\nThere are certain things in life that elicit a communal “OHHHHHHHHHHH” reaction. If you’ve ever been in a packed gym for a basketball game where someone did something absolutely amazing, it feels like that. And getting to be a part of it in person feels incredible.\n\nThe crowd reaction is so good.\n\n\n\nNothing like a hot crowd for a basketball game. pic.twitter.com/Z2Z8yNlzAs — De’Vion Hinton (@LordDexHinton) July 8, 2023\n\nI never thought I’d feel that in a movie theater. But there’s a stunt sequence in Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part 1 that got that reaction out of my crowd at the screening I went to. Through sheer force of will and movie star badassery, Tom Cruise had my Tuesday night movie screening sounding like a basketball game.\n\nYou can keep the Keanu Reeves of the world. Brad Pitt, Leo, Matt Damon, Christian Bale, whatever MCU star you want to name. It doesn’t matter. Tom Cruise has no rivals and no equals as a movie star. He is a cinematic event unto himself. And we may never see anyone like him again.\n\nEnjoy him while you can. And do so on the biggest possible movie screen you can find. Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part 1 is yet another can’t miss moment in an already incomprehensible legacy. It’s one of them ones.\n\nGrade: A+\n\nRecommendation: IMAX, Dolby, RPX, whatever you got at your local cinema. Go to that shit.\n\nCheck out our other Pop Culture coverage here on the blog including our reviews of No Hard Feelings, Moon Garden, Beau is Afraid, and more.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @WatchWithApollo, Tik Tok @WatchWithApollo, and subscribe to our Youtube Channel Watch With Apollo for more.\n\nThanks for reading all that, and as always\n\n#SupportFlorencePugh"

        "text": "Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One may be a mouthful, but the newest addition to the 27-year-old movie franchise comes equipped with consistency and relentless energy. The two-hour and 43-minute extravaganza does not stop. Dead Reckoning is an all-out sprint (literally, this is a Tom Cruise picture, after all) to the finish line.\n\nAll the usual suspects are here. There are telephoto shots of Tom Cruise doing his best Usain Bolt impression. There are messages that self-destruct. There are our old Impossible Mission Force friends Luther Stickell and Benji Dunn, portrayed by Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg, respectively, whose familiarity allows Dead Reckoning to advance a complicated plot at a breakneck pace. With all that same, Dead Reckoning manages to be different. The film is a fresh, pulse-pounding entry into a flailing 2023 summer blockbuster season in dire need of the kind of escapism it provides.\n\nThe advertising blitz leading to the release of Dead Reckoning was vague about the film’s plot details, but without giving away the story, the subject matter is prescient. The story’s villain just a year ago may have seemed like that of a 2000s-era James Bond movie. In 2023, however, Dead Reckoning taps into the basest fears of viewers experiencing modern technological change. The narrative of the seventh Mission: Impossible film seems possible, if not probable, and while it can at times verge into silly, the actors play the scenarios so straight-faced that it’s hard as a viewer not to treat them similarly.\n\nPom Klementieff in Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning – Part One from Paramount Pictures and Skydance.\n\nThe ladies of Dead Reckoning are the most valuable players in the film. Hayley Atwell, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, and Pom Klementieff all hit the ground running and provide compelling foils, allies, and everything in between for the IMF. Klementieff, in particular, shows a side unseen in her previous entries into the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Mantis. Her quirky, stone-cold killer is a welcome addition to the group of substantial actors.\n\nThen there’s Tom Cruise, the superstar of Dead Reckoning. What can be said about Cruise that hasn’t already been said? He certainly has his detractors, but it’s challenging to find an argument against him being on the movie star Mount Rushmore. The man is here to entertain, and all of Dead Reckoning is a testament to that. Cruise runs, jumps, rides, quips, and emotes with the same conviction we’ve come to expect from his recent offerings. There is no “phone it in” for Tom Cruise, and it results in a compelling and convincing performance that elevates the film to heights (literally) that other big-budget movies don’t always reach.\n\nThere are nitpicks. The dialogue can be corny at times. The characters habitually look off into the distance and dramatically utter the movie’s plot, seemingly directly to the audience at times. The main villain, and by proxy the story in general, while modern, is a little on the nose. Those taking this thrill ride should know that Dead Reckoning is part one of two, and expectations should be tempered to match that. Every loose end does not necessarily receive a tie-up here.\n\nThese gripes, however, are minor complaints about a film that doesn’t take itself seriously enough to warrant them. The film is here to entertain, and it does, with exquisite style and substance. Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is the movie of the summer so far and earns a recommendation."

        "text": "Tom Cruise has another potential franchise-best entry on his hands with Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One. According to the latest projections, the Paramount and Skydance movie could reach $90 million here in the United States on opening weekend. The three-day weekend estimate for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One sits at $65 million. That would put the latest Ethan Hunt adventure ahead of Mission: Impossible – Fallout's $61 million opening back in 2018. That year and 2019 were absolutely banner years for the cinema on multiple fronts.\n\nMore interestingly, the success of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One creates another dimension to Cruise's partnership with Paramount. As you all are probably aware, Top Gun: Maverick earned approximately infinite dollars at the box office. A lot of theater owners are pushing for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One to be successful as well. Cruise was absolutely adamant about the importance of the theatric experience in the face of streaming a few years ago. So, that all hangs in the air as well.\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One Features Some Absolutely Harrowing Stunts\n\n(Photo: Paramount/Empire Magazine)\n\nComicBook.com's Brandon Davis talked to Hayley Atwell about working with Cruise. Her admiration for the star stems from his desire to make good with his co-stars. He goes out of his way to make them feel welcome. And that would include one particularly hairy stunt that most stars of his stature simply wouldn't sign up for!\n\n\"How did Tom Cruise manage to sit in the passenger seat first of all, handcuffed to someone else who was driving him, drifting him?\" Atwell said. \"That, to me, shows total dedication to his craft. [That's] probably the hardest thing he's ever done in Mission: Impossible. He was so generous, wanting to find moments for Grace that had real levity in the middle of the car chase sequence -- that had real comedy between them, that felt earned, that didn't feel pushed, or didn't feel like it was actually gonna take away from the stakes of it.\n\nShe added, \"Watching Tom and [Christopher McQuarrie] design this, this sequence and having me on a racetrack very early in the morning before the sun had come up with [stunt driver] Wade Eastwood in London, making sure that I was drifting competently and weaving in between cones, to make sure that I could obstacle courses, meant that by the time we got out to Rome, we knew what the shape of it was, and we knew that there was always gonna be time to ad lib.\"\n\nHow Does The Creative Team Decide on Stunts For These Movies?\n\n(Photo: Empire Magazine/Paramount Pictures)\n\nEvery big action movie now has numerous set-pieces. But, how does Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One go about choosing what makes the cut? Director Christopher McQuarrie talked to Comicbook.com about his choices with these films. He gave some insight on how they crack \"the stunt\" of any given movie in this franchise.\n\n\"There's not a chicken, there's not an egg,\" McQuarrie explained to Brandon Davis. \"Sometimes we start with...like, Fallout started with the emotional story of Ethan and Julia, and the stunts were kind of put around in the periphery. The beginning of this one, I said, 'What do you want to do?' He said, 'I want to ride a motorcycle off a cliff. What do you want to do?' And I said, 'I want to wreck a train. Let's just wreck a train.' Of course, both of us at one point or another would remind the other, 'You know, this was your idea. You wanted to do this.' Tom was very fortunate in one respect becuase he got his stunt out of the way day one. I'm still shooting that train. That just took forever, and it was very, very challenging.\"\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One Poised to Change The Game\n\nTom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, which premieres in theaters on July 12th. It's the beginning of the end for the action-packed franchise, as Cruise reteams with longtime collaborator and filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie for more death-defying and breathtaking stunts. Hunt and allies Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) attempt to track down a new weapon with the power to tear the world apart. Actors Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, and Esai Morales join the cast for the latest installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise, which is set to wrap up with Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two.\n\nAre you seeing Mission: Impossible when it releases?

Unless, that is, Tom Cruise chose to accept it.\n\nThe fearless actor has, once again, created such an incredible big screen blockbuster that audiences will simply have to pay for a ticket to see it.\n\n4 Tom Cruise's latest Mission Impossible is a blockbuster for the ages Credit: Alamy\n\nAfter the success of the superb Top Gun: Maverick, that finally got bums in cinema seats after lockdown, Cruise has hit the ground running – and jumping/flying/driving/train hopping – again with this action-packed ride.\n\nThe seventh – and without a doubt best – in the excellent MI franchise sees Ethan Hunt (Cruise) back with his Impossible Mission Force, including computer hackers Benji (Simon Pegg) and Ving (Luther Stickell), and martial art fighter Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson).\n\nThey are to embark on their most dangerous mission yet: finding a terrifying new weapon that threatens all of humanity if it falls into the wrong hands.\n\nSo far, so very Bond, right? In fact, the film starts deep below the Arctic sea, where a submarine full of sweaty Russians watch on a bleeping sonar as they are about to be attacked for a key that’s on board.\n\nIt feels like any minute James will appear with a Martini and one-liner.\n\nBut, no. This is far superior to anything Danial Craig and his crew have done in the last decade.\n\nThe gadgets are better, the storyline sleeker and the stunts... Well, my God. They are beyond anything seen on the big screen before.\n\nNot only do they take your breath away, they make you hold it until all you can produce is a wispy “whoa”.\n\n4 Cruise's death-defying stunts will take your breath away Credit: Alamy\n\nAnd it’s not only the death-defying Cruise that risks every bone in his body to avoid green screens in this all-authentic action film.\n\nHayley Atwell, who plays the pick-pocketing Grace, also throws herself into some serious stunts that see her speeding through the streets of Rome and dangling from fallen train carriages.\n\nPower-mad Alanna Mitsopolis (Vanessa Kirby) purrs her way onto screen again, as well as psychotic baddie Gabriel (Esai Morales).\n\nIn my role as film critic I have seen cars chase through the streets of Rome in Fast X and fights happening on top of a runaway train in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny in the past month. Both happen in this MI.\n\nBut they are a bit like watching a cartoon – littered with CGI and AI characters.\n\nCruise and co. put all that to shame. And for that I’d like to thank them.\n\nNow let’s wait for this film to blow up in five… four... three…\n\n4 Mission: Impossible's car chases but rival action movies to shame Credit: Alamy"

        "text": "Movie: Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One\n\nYear: 2023\n\nDirector: Christopher McQuarrie\n\nRunning time: 2h 43m\n\nLast summer, Tom Cruise was given credit for saving the theatrical experience with the widely beloved “Top Gun: Maverick.” One of our last true movie stars returns over a year later as the blockbuster experience seems to be fading with high-budget Hollywood endeavors like “The Flash” and “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” falling short of expectations. Can he be Hollywood’s savior again? I hope so because “Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One” is a ridiculously good time. Once again, director Christopher McQuarrie, Cruise, and their team have crafted a deceptively simple thriller, a film that bounces good, bad, and in-between characters off each other for 163 minutes (an admittedly audacious runtime for a film with “Part One” in the title that somehow doesn’t feel long). Some of the overcooked dialogue about the importance of this particular mission gets repetitive, but then McQuarrie and his team will reveal some stunningly conceived action sequence that makes all the spy-speak tolerable. Hollywood is currently questioning the very state of its industry. Leave it to Ethan Hunt to accept the mission.\n\nWhile this series essentially rebooted in its fourth chapter, changing tone and style significantly, this seventh film very cleverly ties back to the 1996 Brian De Palma original more than any other, almost as if it’s uniting the two halves of the franchise. It’s not an origin story, but it does have the tenor of something like the excellent “Casino Royale” in how it unpacks the very purpose of a beloved character. “Dead Reckoning Part One” is about Ethan Hunt reconciling how he got to this point in his life, and McQuarrie and co-writer Erik Jendresen narratively recall De Palma’s film repeatedly. And with its sweaty, canted close-ups, Fraser Taggart’s cinematography wants you to remember the first movie—how Ethan Hunt became an agent and the price he’s been paying from the beginning.\n\nIt’s not just visual nods. “Dead Reckoning” returns former IMF director Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny) to Ethan’s life with a new mission. Kittridge informs Hunt that there’s essentially a rogue AI in the world that superpowers are battling to control. The A.I. can be manipulated with a key split into two halves. One of those halves is about to be sold on the black market, and so Ethan and his team—including returning characters Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg)—have to not just intercept the key but discern its purpose. The key only matters if IMF can figure out where and how to use it.\n\nAfter a desert shoot-out that ushers Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) back into the series, the first major set piece in “Dead Reckoning Part One” takes place in the Dubai airport, where Hunt discovers that there are other players in this espionage chess game, including a familiar face in Gabriel (Esai Morales), a morally corrupt mercenary who is one of the reasons that Hunt is an agent in the first place. Gabriel is a chaos agent, someone who not only wants to watch the world burn but also hopes the fire inflicts as much pain as possible. In many ways, Gabriel is the inverse of Ethan, whose weakness has been his empathy and personal connections—Gabriel has none of those, and he’s basically working for the A.I., trying to get the key so no one can control it.\n\nAt the airport, Ethan also crosses paths with a pickpocket named Grace (Hayley Atwell), who gets stuck in the middle of all of this world-changing insanity, along with a few agents trying to hunt down the rogue Ethan, who are played by a wonderfully exasperated Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis. A silent assassin, memorably sketched by Pom Klementieff, is also essential to a few action scenes. And Vanessa Kirby returns as the arms dealer White Widow, and, well, if the ensemble has a weakness, it’s Kirby’s kind of lost performance. She has never quite been able to convey “power player” in these films as she should.\n\nBut that doesn’t matter because people aren’t here for the White Widow’s backstory. They want to see Tom Cruise run. The image most people associate with “Mission: Impossible” is probably that of Mr. Cruise stretching those legs and swinging those arms. He does that more than once here, but it seems like the momentum of that image was the artistic force behind this entire film. “Dead Reckoning Part One” prioritizes movement—trains, cars, and Ethan’s legs. It’s an action film that’s about speed and urgency, something that has been so lost in the era of CGI’s diminished stakes. Runaway trains will always have more inherent visceral power than waves of animated bad guys, and McQuarrie knows how to use it sparingly to make an action film that both feels modern and old-fashioned at the same time. These films don’t over-rely on CGI, ensuring that we know that it’s really Mr. Cruise jumping off that motorcycle. When punches connect, bodies fly, and cars crash into each other—we feel it instead of just passively observing it. The action here is so wonderfully choreographed that only “John Wick: Chapter 4” compares for the best in the genre this year.\n\nThere’s also something fascinating thematically here about a movie star battling AI and questioning the purpose of his job. Blockbusters have been cautionary tech tales for generations, but think about the meta aspect of a spy movie in which the world could collapse if the espionage game is overtaken by a sentient computer that stars an actor who has been at the center of controversy regarding his own deepfakes. There’s also a definite edge to the plotting here that plays into the actor’s age in that Ethan is forced to answer questions about what matters to him regarding his very unusual work/life balance, a reflection of what a performer like Cruise must face as he reaches the end of an action movie rope that’s been much longer than anyone could have even optimistically expected. Cruise may or may not intend that reading—although I suspect he does—but it adds another layer to the action.\n\nOf course, the most important thing is this: “Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One” is just incredibly fun. It feels half its length and contains enough memorable action sequences for some entire franchises. Will Cruise save the blockbuster experience again? Maybe. And he might do it again next summer too.\n\nCulled from www.rogerebert.com\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nTelegram\n\nMore\n\nMastodon\n\nEmail\n\nReddit\n\nPocket\n\n"

        "text": "“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” topped domestic box office charts while falling short of initial expectations. Tom Cruise‘s latest blockbuster collected $56.2 million between Friday and Sunday, a lackluster start for a movie that cost nearly $300 million before marketing.\n\nHeading into the weekend, Paramount and Skydance’s action-adventure was hoping to establish a new franchise record with $60 million or more. Instead, ticket sales landed behind 2018’s “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” ($61 million) and 2000’s “Mission: Impossible II” ($57.8 million), which remain as the top openings in the 27-year-old series.\n\nComparisons aren’t exact because “Dead Reckoning Part One” opened on Wednesday rather than Friday. The seventh installment has generated an estimated $80 million in its first five days of release, which is more than “Fallout” ($77.5 million) and “Mission: Impossible II” ($78.8 million) earned in their first five days in theaters. With a stellar 96% on Rotten Tomatoes and a glowing “A” CinemaScore, though, “Dead Reckoning” is likely to remain a force at the box office throughout the summer.\n\nBut right now, it’s pulling in similar numbers to Disney’s $300 million-budgeted “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” which debuted to $60 million over the traditional weekend and pulled in $84 million through the five-day Fourth of July holiday frame. “Indiana Jones 5,” which doesn’t have the benefit of great reviews or very positive audience scores, hasn’t shown endurance; ticket sales stand at $136 million domestically and $302 million worldwide.\n\nTo avoid a similar fate, “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” needs to have a box office run as long and unwieldy as the film’s title. The movie, which finds Cruise’s teflon operative Ethan Hunt defying death as he flies off a mountain on his motorcycle, scales a runaway train and maneuvers a tiny car through the bustling streets of Rome, was incredibly expensive due to COVID-related starts and stops and other pandemic-era safety measures. So there’s a chance that next summer’s sequel, “Dead Reckoning Part Two,” also directed and co-written by Christopher McQuarrie, will be less expensive.\n\nRepeat business, as well as global box office returns, will be key in saving Cruise’s latest mission. Already, the seventh “Mission: Impossible” is showing strength at the international box office with $155 million, even with its weak $25.4 million debut in China. That brings its worldwide tally to a respectable $235 million, the biggest global start for the franchise.\n\n“This [domestic] opening is roughly average for an action thriller at this point in its series,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. “The foreign markets are where action movies excel and the overseas openings are strong.”\n\n“Mission: Impossible” films tend to attract an older audience, which doesn’t always show up in force on opening weekend. With good word-of-mouth, ticket buyers could continue to find the film, as was the case with Cruise’s enduring smash “Top Gun: Maverick,” which powered to $1.4 billion last summer.\n\nIn the past, “Mission” installments have demonstrated remarkable box office longevity even with smaller opening weekends. “Fallout,” for example, collected $61 million to start and ended up setting a series record with $791 million globally. Plus, “Mission” movies tend to earn roughly 70% of overall ticket sales at the international box office. That should help offset any potential shortcomings in North America.\n\nThat’s good news because Ethan Hunt is gearing up to face the phenomenon known as “Barbenheimer.” Next weekend, the latest “Mission” will compete for attention against Christopher Nolan’s dark historical drama “Oppenheimer” and Greta Gerwig’s hot pink romp “Barbie,” both of which open on July 21. The unlikely showdown between the two very different films has become an online craze, one that has carried into the real world with tens of thousands of moviegoers booking double features of “Oppenheimer” and “Barbie.”\n\n“‘MI7’ could also benefit by being in the epicenter of that box office storm as a hugely appealing alternative to the other two films,” says senior Comscore analyst Paul Dergarabedian. “‘Cruisenheimer’ anyone?”\n\nElsewhere, the unlikely box office hit “Sound of Freedom” climbed to second place in its sophomore outing with $25 million from 3,265 theaters, up 25% from last weekend. The faith-based movie about child sex trafficking has collected a remarkable $83 million after two weeks of release. It’s a reminder in the power of religious audiences, who have turned out in force and look to propel the low-budget movie past $100 million.\n\nSony’s horror sequel “Insidious: The Red Door,” which led the box office last weekend, dropped to No. 3 with $13 million from 3,188 venues. So far, the movie has collected a strong $58 million on its $16 million budget.\n\n“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” took fourth place in its third weekend of release, adding $12 million from 3,865 venues. To date, the Harrison Ford-led tentpole has grossed $145 million in North America and $302 million globally.\n\nDisney and Pixar’s “Elemental” rounded out the top five, generating $8.7 million from 3,235 theaters in its fifth weekend on the big screen. The animated family film, which cost $200 million, has managed to stick around with $125.3 million domestically and $311.7 million worldwide. But, like “Indy 5,” the massive production budget means it has ways to go to really climb out of the red in its theatrical run.\n\nIn limited release, Searchlight’s mockumentary “Theater Camp” opened to $270,000 from six theaters in New York and Los Angeles — averaging a healthy $45,000 per location. The film, which stars Ben Platt and Molly Gordon as kooky drama instructors who attempt to keep their beloved summer camp in business, premiered at Sundance Film Festival to enthusiastic reviews. Moviegoers were also complimentary, awarding the film an “A” CinemaScore. Next weekend, “Theater Camp” will continue its slow expansion to Austin, Chicago, Boston, Denver and San Francisco, among other cities."

        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — After a globe-trotting publicity blitz by Syracuse-born star Tom Cruise, “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” launched with a franchise-best $80 million over five days, though it came in shy of industry expectations with a $56.2 million haul over the three-day weekend, according to studio estimates.\n\nThe Paramount Pictures debut was boosted by strong overseas sales of $155 million from 70 markets. But while a $235 million worldwide launch marked one of the best global openings of the year, “Dead Reckoning” couldn’t approach the high-speed velocity of last summer’s top film, “Top Gun: Maverick.”\n\n“Dead Reckoning Part One,” the seventh film in the 27-year-old series, had been forecast to better the franchise high of the previous installment, “Fallout,” which opened with $61 million domestically in 2018. Instead, it also fell short of the $57.8 million “Mission: Impossible II” debuted with in 2000.\n\nThat puts the film’s opening-weekend tally very close to the tepid launch of Disney’s “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” which opened in U.S. and Canadian theaters with $82 million over five days and $60 million over the three-day weekend. Paramount and Skydance had higher hopes for the action extravaganza of “Dead Reckoning,” which cost $290 million to make, not counting marketing expenses.\n\nThose costs were inflated, in part, by the pandemic. “Dead Reckoning,” directed by Christopher McQuarrie, was among the first major productions shut down by COVID-19. It was preparing to shoot in Italy in March 2020. When the film got back on track, McQuarrie and Cruise helped lead the industry-wide recovery back to film sets – albeit with some well-publicized friction over protocols along the way.\n\nStill, “Dead Reckoning” was hailed as a high point in the franchise. Critics (96% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and fans (an “A” CinemaScore) alike came away awed by the stunts and chases of the latest “Mission: Impossible” film. Though the coming competition of “Barbenheimer” — the much-anticipated debuts of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” — looms, “Mission: Impossible” should play well for weeks to come.\n\n“This is a global franchise. It’s going gangbusters and its going to play for a long time. Quality always wins in the end,” said Chris Aronson, distribution chief for Paramount.\n\n“Dead Reckoning,” Aronson said, met or exceeded the studio’s expectations.\n\n“In international markets, in like-for-like markets, we’re 15% ahead of ‘Fallout,’ and that’s taking China out,” added Aronson. “Domestically, we’re over 3% ahead of ‘Fallout’ for the first five days. To beat its predecessor is phenomenal, especially in this environment.”\n\nCruise, the so-called savior of movie theaters last year, traveled tirelessly to again pump life back into a summer box office that’s been sluggish. After a splashy world premiere in Rome with a red-carpet on the Spanish Steps, Cruise and McQuarrie surprised theaters in Atlanta, Miami, Toronto and Washington D.C. in the days ahead of opening.\n\n“Dead Reckoning” hit theaters at a crucial mid-summer period for Hollywood, and not just because of the SAG-AFTRA strike which began Thursday. “Mission: Impossible” launched a week before one of the biggest box-office showdowns of the year.\n\nThough “Dead Reckoning” and “Oppenheimer” have vied for some of the same IMAX screens, each film has publicly endorsed the idea that a rising tide lifts all blockbusters. Cruise and McQuarrie in early July even bought opening-weekend tickets to both “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer.” “Barbie” director Greta Gerwig and “Oppenheimer” filmmaker Christopher Nolan reciprocated with their own gestures of support.\n\nHowever that trio of films performs over the next few weeks will do a lot to determine the fate of the summer box office.\n\n“These are a crucial couple of weeks for the industry starting this weekend,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore. “I think it’s going to be a fun reinvigoration of the box office because we have had a few films underperforming. Really, the summer movie season restarts this week with ‘Mission’ leading into ‘Barbenheimer.’”\n\nNo other new wide release challenged “Mission: Impossible” over the weekend. Second place went to Angel Studios’ faith-based political thriller “Sound of Freedom” which increased 37% in its second with $27 million. Jim Caveziel stars in the child trafficking drama.\n\nLast week’s top film, “Insidious: The Red Door \" slid to third with $13 million in its second weekend. “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” is dropping quickly with $12 million its third weekend, with a domestical total so far of $145.4 million.\n\nIn limited release, the Searchlight Pictures’ mockumentary “Theater Camp” opened to $270,000 from six theaters in New York and Los Angeles.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.\n\n1. “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” $56.2 million.\n\n2. “Sound of Freedom,” $27 million.\n\n3. “Insidious: The Red Door,” $13 million.\n\n4. “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” $12 million.\n\n5. “Elemental,” $8.7 million.\n\n6. “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” $6.1 million.\n\n7. “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,” $3.4 million.\n\n8. “No Hard Feelings,” $3.3 million.\n\n9. “Joy Ride,” $2.6 million.\n\n10. “The Little Mermaid,” $2.4 million."

However, amidst the thrill, a section of Netizens noticed similarities between some shots in the trailer and Shah Rukh Khan’s upcoming film, Pathaan. Particularly, the train-set sequences drew comparisons between the two movies, leading to online discussions and contrasting opinions.\n\nTwitter users shared screenshots from both films, highlighting the resemblances they observed. Instances like Tom Cruise hanging off a cliff and the train crash scene triggered memories of Pathaan for fans. One user pointed out the irony, saying, “Few days ago, I saw the whole Twitter making fun of #Pathaan train scene just because it accidentally has a similarity with Jackie Chan cartoon. But now that #MissionImpossible also has similar action scenes, nobody will say anything.” Another user shared screenshots of matching scenes and humorously noted, “Bollywood should be proud.”\n\nA user highlighted the comparable shots but received contrasting responses. One user argued, “Train falling off a bridge with people on top was not invented by Tom Cruise or SRK… it’s been an old stunt or action sequence… that’s like saying, ‘Oh, these two songs have the same scale.'” Another user chimed in, stating, “I am sorry, what?! I thought Pathaan was an Indian copy of all Mission Impossible films? The entire train sequence is a scene-to-scene remake of a Jackie Chan animation.”\n\nAdvertisement"

The follow up, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning, Part Two, is scheduled for release next year.\n\nA last word: go see Mission: Impossible on the big screen - not just to spot Tom Cruise filming in our neck of the woods, but for a massive adrenaline rush while you do so!\n\nThe day we met Tom Cruise\n\nTOM Cruise made even more fans during his brief spell filming in North Yorkshire for Mission Impossible: 7.\n\nHe posed for photos with wellwishers and onlookers during filming of action scenes on a train at Levisham, near Pickering, back in April 2021.\n\nIt was during the pandemic, so masks were worn and social distancing observed.\n\nAmong locals lucky enough to see and meet Tom were Harriet Allen and her mum Amy, who saw him at Levisham.\n\nHarriet told The Press shortly after the meeting: \"My mum and I live in Pickering and a few months ago we heard a rumour that Tom Cruise had been spotted getting off a helicopter up the railway line.\n\nHarriet and her mum Amy meet Tom Cruise while he was filming in North Yorkshire for Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning\n\n\"We didn’t think much of it till I did a bit of Googling and things started to happen on the railway - two carriages and a strange train appeared one weekend when we were out walking.\"\n\nHarriet said: \"Last weekend my parents spotted a huge marquee up on the old trout farm site and we heard the helicopters, so last night we went up to Levisham to see what was going on!\n\n\"We kept away from the crew and sat on the moor, watching the train speed off and followed by a helicopter filming it. But then the train came back about 20 mins later, and they all got off.\n\n\"We decided to cautiously wander to the station and we saw Tom say hello to the small bunch of onlookers on his way to his trailer. Then an assistant came out of his trailer to ask who were the ones having photos. We assumed it was all pre-arranged but they came to each bubble of people, handing out masks if any one needed and organising our photos before the star himself appeared, with trademark aviators!\n\n\"He was lovely and gracious, stopping for photos with everyone and commented on how much he liked Yorkshire. A really lovely guy - he didn’t need to come and do this, we were quite taken aback.\""

Well, most spy thrillers are often a product of one's imagination, a representation of novels with heroic characters, or a rehash inspired by other spy dramas.\n\nWhile the Mission Impossible franchise could be based on a TV series, the dare-devilry action performed by the 61-year-old actor in these movies are a visual treat for all. And with Cruise performing his career's most dangerous stunt in Mission Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, the new installment has blown away the minds of the audience.\n\nHowever, Cruise isn't the only actor known for playing a fearless spy (Ethan Hunt) on the big screen. Many known actors like Matt Damon, Salman Khan, Scarlett Johansson and others have entertained the audience with their spy acts in edge-of-the-seat thrillers and parodies.

        "text": "By Jana Monji\n\nFrench actress Pom Klementieff, 37, is best known as her Guardians of the Galaxy character, Mantis, but instead of the whimsically cheerful alien, she plays an assassin working against Ethan Hunt and his team in Mission: Impossible–Dead Reckoning.\n\nEthan Hunt and his team accept the mission to find two interlocking keys. Hunt’s old friend, former M16 agent, Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) holds one and Hunt must go into the Arabian Desert near the Yemen border to retrieve it.\n\nOn horseback, he’s pursued by riders with guns for a sand-blown shootout. Faust is listed as dead but now Hunt must exchange the key for money. He hopes that the buyer will lead him to the other key and reveal what and where the keys can be used.\n\nThe exchange at the Midfield Terminal of the Abu Dhabi International Airport doesn’t go well, and Hunt is forced to team up with a pickpocket who calls herself Grace (Hayley Atwell).\n\nHunt’s team guides and helps him avoid other teams also in pursuit of the key by feeding into the surveillance system false images of Hunt on unsuspecting innocent bystanders.\n\nAnother team turns that game against Hunt. There’s an invisible man, one hidden by the Entity behind one of the teams, but there’s also a nuclear bomb in the baggage that one team member must defuse by answering riddles. Hunt’s just distracted enough to let Grace escape.\n\nHunt follows Grace to Rome and it’s there that Pom’s assassin, the silent Paris, makes her appearance. She’s a no-nonsense girl driving a big black SUV.\n\nKlementieff told Digital Spy “I wanted to be something eerie and strange and kind of like a monster, but that looked like a porcelain doll or a pantomime at first. It was inspired by the character Pierrot from the Commedia Dell’Arte. I wanted to bring something that was a bit melancholic but also a little wild that’s unleashed when I do the car chase.”\n\nThe audience soon learns that the ghost at the airport is a very real man, Gabriel (Esai Morales). Paris is also on his team.\n\nWhile Cruise’s Hunt and Atwell’s Grace share driving duties during a crazy and often humorous car chase in Rome, Klementieff’s Paris seems to relish the chaos and destruction. While Hunt and Grace make it out of Rome they will be running to and from each other and ghosts in their computer systems in Venice.\n\nParis will face Hunt–the first time in the franchise that Hunt will be fighting a woman, according to Digital Spy. That may be the reason why Hunt shows mercy, but the question must always be: Will this act of kindness hurt or help the mission?\n\nThat will be answered when a disguised Grace ends up on a train and Hunt is delayed from joining her while Gabriel and Paris are already on board. The title tells us that this fast-moving film will end with a cliffhanger and director Christopher McQuarrie gets you there with intense action scenes that while remaining serious have visual humor.\n\nMcQuarrie co-wrote the screenplay with Erik Jendresen (HBO miniseries Band of Brothers), but McQuarrie has been credited with the Mission Impossible screenplays since Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol in 2011 (with Josh Appelbaum and André Nemec). He also directed the 2015 Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation and the 2018 Mission: Impossible – Fallout.\n\nAlthough, unlike the original series which seemed more of a team mission, the film series is a Tom Cruise-centric story, his character, Ethan Hunt has friends and enemies who return from previous films.\n\nThis film’s Mission: Impossible Force includes computer technician (and Hunt’s BFF) Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames and IMF technical field agent Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg). The black market arms dealer, Alanna Mitsopolis (Vanessa Kirby), AKA the “White Widow” is the daughter of a character from the first film and was last seen in the 2018 Fallout.\n\nKlementieff’s Paris, like Kirby’s Alanna, has a certain fashion flare. Working for a man who knew Ethan before he was Ethan, Paris is part of a mysterious menacing adversarial group whose client isn’t initially revealed. Even when one knows more about that entity, there are so many questions still unanswered.\n\nWhile Klementieff may not have any lines, she is an important player during some of the action scenes, particularly the car chase. Klementieff’s Paris will be back for Part Two when so many questions will be answered.\n\n“Mission: Impossible –Dead Reckoning Part One” premiered on the Spanish Steps in Rome on 19 June 2023. Paramount released the film in theaters on 12 July 2022. “Part Two” is scheduled to be released on 28 June 2024.\n\nAsAmNews is published by the non-profit, Asian American Media Inc.

In this episode, we feature our thoughts on Mission Impossible and Almost Paradise as well as some other shows and movies that have been keeping us busy over the summer.\n\nWe kick off the show with our review of Indiana Jones and The Dial of Destiny and then move on to the new season of Almost Paradise, which dropped last weekend on Amazon’s Freevee channel. The show, which stars Christian Kane as retired DEA Agent Alex Walker is a rare blend of action and comedy and is somewhat of a throwback to TV shows that populated the networks throughout the 1980s and 90s. Jeff thinks this show is Christian Kane’s best work to date. Whereas Ian loves the blend of action and comedy.\n\nNext up Marx talks about Silo now that he has viewed most of the show and expresses some concern as to where the show might go in its second season now that one of the key mysteries has been revealed.\n\nNext up Jeff gives us his thoughts on ⁠Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One⁠ and enjoyed how the film uses A.I. as the main part of its story. He was particularly impressed with Hayley Atwell in her role as the thief Grace who gets in over her head with a certain group of IMF agents.\n\nWe round out the show by talking about Heels, which is a show about a group of professional wrestlers as they struggle to keep their franchise going. Heels stars Stephen Amell who is best known for his role of Oliver Queen in CW’s Arrow.\n\nAnd finishing off. Jeff, Marx, and Ian give their thoughts on Star Trek: Strange New Worlds episodes Charades and Lost In Translation. So tune in. Zone out and have fun while we take you through a variety of TV shows with some really bad puns and awful jokes.\n\nYou can listen to this latest episode by pushing play on the Audio Player embedded below:\n\nIf you enjoyed our reviews show, please subscribe to our feeds and follow us on Spotify and iTunes"

Thankfully, Kartik Aaryan and Kiara Advani’s SatyaPrem Ki Katha did the job of getting things back on track. Amid this, the Hollywood biggies continue to enjoy run of their own at the Indian box office, with first Fast X and now Mission: Impossible 7 turning out to be major successes. Keep reading to know more!\n\nIn a surprising trend, 2023 has witnessed no box office failure from Hollywood in India (major releases). Even though there have been limited films, none of them turned out to be a loss affair. On the other hand, there has been inconsistency with Bollywood releases. Thankfully, there are a couple of winners in quick succession, but on the whole, Hollywood releases have shown their dominance.\n\nIn 2023, except for Pathaan and The Kerala Story, there have been no big successes from Bollywood. Even Tu Jhooti Main Makkaar, despite closing its run near 150 crores, ended up being an average affair due to its cost. On the other hand, Fast X scored a century and was a huge success at the Indian box office. Now, even Mission: Impossible 7 is following the same route.\n\nMission: Impossible is now standing at 65 crores and will soon be overtaking SatyaPrem Ki Katha (75.75 crores) and Zara Hatke Zara Bachke (86 crores), which are celebrated as Bollywood’s recent successes. It clearly shows Hollywood’s dominance over Bollywood releases.\n\nStay tuned to Koimoi for more box office updates!\n\nNote: Box office numbers are based on estimates and various sources.

        "text": "Extending one of the most successful franchises in movie history, Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One follows secret agent Ethan Hunt on a quest to save the world from an AI program known as The Entity.\n\nTom Cruise is back as Hunt, accompanied by series regulars Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, and Vanessa Kirby. New to the franchise: supervillain Esai Morales and his deadly cohort Pom Klementieff.\n\nDead Reckoning unfolds on a massive scale, with scenes shot in Rome, Venice, Abu Dhabi, Tangier, Austria, and Norway, as well as various studios in the UK. COVID disrupted the project, complicating logistics for director Christopher McQuarrie and his production designer Gary Freeman.\n\nThis is the first Mission: Impossible credit for Freeman, who worked previously on films like Allied and Tomb Raider. He spoke with Below the Line by phone from England, where he is hard at work on Dead Reckoning Part Two.\n\nBelow the Line: Give us a sense of the scale of this project. When and where did your work start?\n\nGary Freeman: I started on this back in the autumn of 2019. They’d already scouted several countries. I was concentrating on the Italian locations. Venice and Rome would be tentpole sequences for the movie. We were also in Ukraine. I believe President Zelensky reached out to Tom at some point, but the situation there obviously changed.\n\nTravel, distant locations — they’re the heartbeat of these movies. We’re in Venice in autumn, 2019, and it felt like everything was simmering. Veneto was kind of the epicenter of European COVID, but nobody really understood it yet. We decided to move to Rome, but COVID was spreading like wildfire. We were about to head out to Abu Dhabi when the whole world imploded.\n\nTom and Chris wanted to keep the momentum going, so we continued to work. I planned the desert build and the train sequences and had endless Zoom meetings with Chris McQuarrie.\n\nI think we were one of the first movies to have boots back on the ground when we restarted in Venice.\n\nBelow the Line: How important is it to do practical stunts instead of using visual effects? How does it affect your work as well?\n\nFreeman: It’s all about the energy and the performance. We all know you can shoot in a CGI volume, and these artisans with amazing digital skills can pretty much do anything.\n\nBut with practical stunts you can see subtleties in performances. Take the Orient Express sequences. We shot that for real in Norway. We’re not on a green screen stage, we’re on real rolling stock going through an amazing countryside. The quality of light is different. You see light going through a cloud, you see the nuances of the performances. You’re immersed in the action.\n\nTo help get that, we built rubber tops for the railroad carriages so Tom and Esai could get decent grips for their stunts. We built lower roof sections so we could travel on real tracks in a real environment. The visual effects team could work with real imagery rather than digitally generating backgrounds.\n\nBelow the Line: What about the interior scenes in the rail cars? What did it take to be able to move them the way you did?\n\nFreeman: That was all done on huge rigs. [Special effects supervisor] Neil Corbould and his team built these amazing rigs that could tip up and spin and drop. Huge gimbal rigs that were shot on the back lot. I can’t remember how many we had because there were so many manifestations of the cars. Obviously, we had stage versions for the dialogue scenes. They were built as sets with flyable or wild walls. We placed them on gimbals that could rock and roll.\n\nThen for the stunt sequences we had metal versions, basically steel boxes that were built onto gimbal rigs depending on whether they had to tilt or drop. The special effects team built the armature or structure for the cars. We’d tell them, “We need something sticking out here and something sticking out there.” You would want all those items welded or securely fixed or boxed to the structure.\n\nWhen Tom and Hayley are dropping through the carriage and landing on those partitions between the sofas or couches? Those were structurally built and then clad in some sort of hard material, a GRP or hard foam, which we painted to look like wood.\n\nBelow the Line: What about that piano in the car? Was that an effect?\n\nFreeman: Oh no, that was a real piano that was dropped. Most movies would probably have done a CG version, but Chris wanted to drop a real piano. He wanted to see it drop away.\n\nBelow the Line: In the old days they would have used horizontal sets and just turned the cameras perpendicular to them, right?\n\nFreeman: Absolutely. But then on a flip side, we referred a lot to The Train, the John Frankenheimer film where Burt Lancaster did his own stunts. That’s the film where they scuttled real trains. The power of that movie when you see real 70-, 80-, 100-ton steam locomotives smashing and crashing—you almost feel the weight of them. Or Buster Keaton’s The General. That’s the way Tom and Chris roll, they want to acknowledge those classic movies where they did it for real. That’s why the energy comes across. You as a viewer feel that it’s real.\n\nIt makes my life a nightmare because it’s so much easier to do it digitally on a green screen and have visual effects add texture. I don’t think that ever works. It doesn’t look as good.\n\nBelow the Line: What about the sequence in Rome where cars are crashing down the Spanish Steps? I noticed in the credits a “do not try this yourself” disclaimer.\n\nFreeman: I don’t know if you’ve been to the Spanish Steps but they’re vast. The idea was to send our version of a military special forces armored truck probably weighing about five tons down them. Chris wanted it to be this sort of Terminator-style unstoppable machine that would break through walls and crash down.\n\nChris is not a previs kind of person because he doesn’t want to be boxed in, but that sequence was so specific that it was very heavily prevised. We always try to give Chris options to swing left or right, but we had to be a bit more surgical in that build. That was something we worked on during COVID. I had digital models we used to spin around, examine angles, to give Chris as much as we could within the parameters we had.\n\nWe split the sequence into three parts. Parts one and three we shot in Rome. So everything at the top of the stairs and everything at the bottom was all Rome.\n\nWe built the steps in between ourselves on the back lot. It was a hugely expensive build because of the detail and also the reinforcement for the armored truck. A lot of structural engineering to work out. We massaged it a bit, used smoke and mirrors to provide an overlap between the three pieces. Then visual effects came in and did their magic and just blended the worlds perfectly together.\n\nBelow the Line: Are you working on Part Two?\n\nFreeman: I am. I’m at my desk going through the locations, trying to get a package together for our director. A lot on, but it’s all good. It’s all good.\n\nBelow the Line: Does Ethan Hunt save the world?\n\nFreeman: I can’t say anything except that the next one’s going to be even bigger.\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is now playing in theaters."

        "text": "The latest film releases include “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,” “Final Cut,” “Black Ice,” and “Theater Camp.” KCRW gets reviews from William Bibbiani, film critic and co-host of the podcasts Canceled Too Soon and Critically Acclaimed; and Alison Willmore, film critic for New York Magazine and Vulture.\n\n“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One”\n\nThis is the seventh installment in the 27-year-old franchise starring Tom Cruise, now age 61, who’s still doing his own stunts. Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Vanessa Kirby and Rebecca Ferguson also star as members of a secret U.S. spy team led by Cruise’s Ethan Hunt. This time, they’re fighting artificial intelligence.\n\nBibbiani: “The plot is just an excuse to travel the world and do car chases and jump onto moving trains. … There's nothing particularly wrong with that. Despite being very entertaining by being very globetrotting, despite having fantastic action sequences, we've reached the point where these movies no longer actually feel like ‘Mission Impossible.’ This is just ‘James Bond.’ But whereas the modern ‘James Bond’ movies are super depressing and want you to really think about how much it would stink to be James Bond, the ‘Mission Impossible’ movies are like: What if ‘James Bond’ — but fun?”\n\nWillmore: “In ‘Top Gun: Maverick,’ Tom Cruise was showing off against the drone plane, right? He was making the case that you still need human pilots, by which he was basically saying, ‘You still need movie stars like me.’ And in this case, he's facing down AI. So he's really making a point in terms of fighting on behalf of analog movies.”\n\n“Final Cut”\n\nThis French zombie horror/comedy is a remake of the 2017 Japanese cult hit “One Cut of the Dead.”\n\nWillmore: “The movie is essentially them showing you how this disparate group of actors and crew members come together … to make the movie that you've already watched. … This film becomes a little bit more about the idea of authenticity and making quality work, even if it's not highbrow. And I don't think that works quite as well. I would say if you can find the Japanese film, it is the one to watch.”\n\nBibbiani: “The remake is too slick. And I think it is weirdly apologetic about the kind of movie that the characters are making. When you watch the zombie movie that they're making, it is way more-in-your-face about how inept it is, whereas in the original ‘One Cut of the Dead,’ it's actually fun and freewheeling and it feels more real. Here, the film is slightly apologetic about itself, and I really think that undermines the wholesome, everything-is-wonderful-about-filmmaking kind of vibe it’s trying to create. If you only ever see the remake, it will probably be fine and be okay. But ‘One Cut of the Dead’ is literally on Shudder right now and you don't have to pay extra for it.”\n\n“Black Ice”\n\nThis documentary exposes racism – past and present – in Canadian and American hockey. Executive produced by Drake and LeBron James, the film won the People's Choice Award for Documentaries when it premiered last year at the Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nBibbiani: “It focuses on the current aspects of the industry where, sadly, there aren't a lot of players of color, and the ones that are playing professional hockey are often denied meaningful opportunities. They're treated with outright racism, not just by fans, but also by their coaches, other teams. But there's also another aspect of it where they … discover a history of a Black hockey team from over 100 years ago, who were directly responsible for helping the sport evolve into its current form. … To see just how important that is and how swept under the rug it was, is both illuminating and, obviously, incredibly shameful.”\n\nWillmore: “The film is a sidelong look at race in Canada. … One of the interviewees, who's an academic, talks about how because Canada was set up as the end of the Underground Railroad … the place where you would go to get away from America and racism and anti-Blackness — that Canada has historically been bad at talking about racism within it because it doesn't fit with the Canadian national story and identity. And there's a lot of denial or looking away, and I felt like that … was so interesting that I almost wanted more to be explored on that.”\n\n“Theater Camp”\n\nThis largely improvised mockumentary stars Ben Platt and Molly Gordon. It revolves around a sleepaway camp in upstate New York and is based on an 18-minute short film that Gordon, Platt, Noah Galvin, and Nick Lieberman uploaded to YouTube a month or so into the COVID pandemic.\n\nWillmore: “It is really a celebration of the idea of theater camp as the sanctuary and haven for all of these young kids. … Most of the male attendees seem to be gay. Most of the girls are … big personalities. And it just is so affectionate about those kids and about the adults, most of whom are … former attendees … and are now eccentric teachers.\n\n… And I think at a moment where we're seeing actors and writers fighting back against large corporations, the underlying story about the scrappy theater camp trying to fight off acquisition from a banker … that has extra resonance.”\n\nBibbiani: “If this is the soothing balm you're looking for right now, this late 90s, Sundance comedy kind of thing, like ‘Wet Hot American Summer’ but not quite as funny, ‘Waiting for Guffman’ but not quite as mean spirited, this will do you right.”"

        "text": "The Mission: Impossible franchise has always found new ways to surprise us when it comes to the practical stunts Tom Cruise will perform, but the announcement of the most recent project also surprised fans when it was announced that the next Mission: Impossible story would be divided in half, requiring two movies to complete. While one has to assume that the studio had little problem greenlighting even more Mission: Impossible, director Christopher McQuarrie says it was the story, not the box office that required Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning to be two movies.\n\nMission: Impossible movies have always been showcases for incredible action. But especially in the time that Christopher McQuarrie has been at the helm, they certainly haven’t skimped on the story either. And because Ethan Hunt works with a team, these are movies with a lot of characters. Speaking with Collider, McQuarrie says that it was ultimately the characters that drove the idea of breaking Dead Reckoning in two because he simply needed more time to create the characters and give them emotional stories. He explained…\n\nWell, we knew with Fallout. Fallout really grew because of all the character and emotion we were putting into the story, all the things that we had discovered in Rogue Nation that was so unexpected. I knew I wanted to expand the cast, and I knew I wanted to give each one of those characters more to do, so I knew the movie was going to be bigger and longer than Fallout. And at which point I said, 'Why are we fighting this? Why are we going to try to jam this into two hours? Let's just break it in half and make it two movies.' That really was the rationale behind it being a two-part movie. It just it wasn't just that the story was bigger but that we wanted more emotion in the movie.\n\nThere certainly are a lot of characters in the Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One cast. In addition to Tom Cruise and his regular team (including Simon Pegg and Ving Raimes), we see the return of characters we haven’t seen since the first entry in the franchise, as well as several new characters who clearly have stories to tell. One can only imagine how difficult it would be to give all of them enough to do, in a way that would be emotionally satisfying, if they tried to cram it all into a single film.\n\nDead Reckoning Part One is already a nearly three-hour movie, so a plot that moved twice as fast would have so much story to cover that it’s hard to imagine we’d get to know the characters at all. McQuarrie has said that he specifically wanted to the new movies to have less plot in them because that let the action tell more of the story, and clearly, it also gave us more time with the various characters.\n\nWhat will happen to our heroes in Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part Two is anybody's guess right now. However, with so much groundwork already done to introduce characters and plot ideas, one can imagine it will hit the ground running, and with another two or three hours of story to tell, it certainly will have the ability to come to a very emotionally satisfying conclusion."

        "text": "Mission: Impossible star Henry Czerny has shed some light on his nearly three-decade long absence from the franchise.\n\nThe Canadian actor, 64, played IMF boss Eugene Kittridge in the original Mission: Impossible film in 1996, but did not appear again until Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, which was released in cinemas this week.\n\nSpeaking to Uproxx, Czerny, who is also known for his role in the spy thriller Clear and Present Danger, revealed that he had once been involved in a dispute over his character.\n\nAhead of filming Mission: Impossible, he took it upon himself to research the role, spending a day and a half with people at the CIA.\n\n“Because they want people to know what they do as well, within reason, of course,” Czerny said. “So, I did all kinds of homework there. And then I had the script with me, and I didn’t try to show them the script, but I knew the questions that I wanted to ask them about it.\n\n“And so I went to the UK with all these answers – all these suggestions about what should be done perhaps with this script. And, of course, that was not met in the way I expected it to be met. It was, ‘Thank you very much, but please keep that to yourself. Great backstory for you. I love that you did that for you.’ Very Mission: Impossible.”\n\nThe actor explained that he was “a bit s***-grinned” over their response because he had “gone through the effort”.\n\nHe continued: “So, after Mission: Impossible, the first month, I had a lunch with Paula Wagner, who was, at that time, Tom [Cruise]’s producing partner. And I let her know all the things they didn’t do with Kittridge, and what they should be doing with Kittridge in the future, if they had options.\n\nHenry Czerny as Kittridge in ‘Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One’ (Paramount)\n\n“And she was very polite, very nice, paid for the lunch. And that’s the last I saw of Mission: Impossible. I burned that bridge.”\n\nCzerny added that they may have been planning to write out his character anyway. “But I certainly didn’t do myself any favours as a young actor telling Paula Wagner what she missed in this supporting character,” he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe actor also claims that Christopher McQuarrie, Dead Reckoning’s director, had wanted to bring back Kittridge in an earlier instalment, “but it just wasn’t right apparently, or whatever”.\n\nHe claimed that McQuarrie was “more open” to his own input on the character.\n\n“Absolutely,” he said. “He’s more open to what the actor wants to bring, given the genre, given the tone of the scene, given the trajectory of the story. Yes. All within that, thank you very much. But bring it and we’ll see. We’ll see.”\n\nDead Reckoning is out in cinemas now."

        "text": "Last summer, when “Top Gun: Maverick” was making roughly all the money printed in the United States during that fiscal quarter, I read a number of articles (many publications jumped on the trend at once) calling Tom Cruise various iterations of “The Last Movie Star.” The moniker is obviously an exaggeration – Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt haven’t exactly been left in the dust in Hollywood – but it’s understandable where it comes from. It may take a few beats to remember that the “Avatar” movies star Sam Worthington or that Tom Holland is the most recent (live-action) version of Spider-Man, but there is no such confusion with a Tom Cruise movie. I bet most people, when discussing the “Mission: Impossible” movies, say “Tom Cruise” instead of his character’s name, Ethan Hunt. For that matter, I wouldn’t be surprised if people say “Tom Cruise” instead of “Jerry Maguire” when discussing the film named after the character.\n\nAll of this is to say that Tom Cruise has an undeniable screen presence and charisma. He certainly has the straight-up talent to justify this popularity, but his blockbuster appeal is about more than that. He clearly believes that if he’s going to be at the top of the industry, he should push himself harder than the rest of the industry. That’s why he insists on undertaking difficult tasks like long sequences of running and dangerous stunts involving planes and motorcycles. This kind of dedication is why “Mission: Impossible” is a respectable franchise unto itself and not the James Bond knockoff that it would be otherwise.\n\nThe new installment sees Hunt racing around the globe to stop The Entity, a computer program that has seemingly become sentient and bent on world domination. Whoever can access The Entity first, whether it’s a government or an individual, can basically control the world. Hunt is initially sanctioned by the U.S. government, represented by Impossible Mission Force leader Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny), but he soon realizes that nobody should be allowed to have that much power, so he goes on a rogue mission to destroy The Entity.\n\nHunt is aided by faithful teammates Luther (Ving Rhames), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson). Complicating matters are money-driven duplicitous characters like high-class pickpocket Grace (Hayley Atwell) and black-market arms dealer Alanna (Vanessa Kirby). Full-on villains include assassin Gabriel (Esai Morales) and his henchwoman Paris (Pom Klementieff, gleefully maniacal in a role that frankly doesn’t call for it), who are apparently representing The Entity itself, and no, I’m not sure how that business relationship works.\n\nThe mission involves gaining possession of two halves of a key and then figuring out what exactly the key opens. It also involves an elaborate series of druggings, pickpocketings, thievery, bomb scares, knife fights, shootouts, car chases, crosses and double-crosses, and a ton of antics with a runaway train. Oh, and those super-realistic masks that this series loves come into play. This movie really hopes you like Vanessa Kirby, because you’re getting a double dose of her here (no complaints from me).\n\nI spent most of this movie having a hard time deciding if it was worth recommending. Cruise and his team are their usual delightful selves, but it seems like this movie’s been done several times before. The villains are more memorable than some of the others in this series, but their motivations are questionable. The action is mostly pretty exciting, but the stakes are affected by the “Part One” in the film’s title, which tells me that nothing too conclusive is going to happen here. At the last minute, the film pulled out an effective action sequence with a train that finally earned it my endorsement. I reckon you’ll have a good time with the seventh “Mission: Impossible”\n\nGrade: B-\n\n“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action, some language, and suggestive material. Its running time is 163 minutes.\n\nContact Bob Garver at rrg251@nyu.edu.\n\nfiled under:"

        "text": "Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning releases tomorrow (13 July) and if you’re a big Mission: Impossible fan, you’ll want to catch it as soon as it hits the screen. Preferably in IMAX because in a week’s time, you won’t be able to.\n\nWhy? Well, you can blame it on the release of Christopher Nolan’s highly anticipated Oppenheimer.\n\nBoth movies release in mid-July with Mission: Impossible releasing on 13 July and Oppenheimer on 20 July. So when the latter drops into theatres, it will take up all IMAX screens in the US for three weeks, leaving Cruise’s spy-action franchise with only a week in IMAX after opening.\n\nCruise was understandably unhappy (via Puck News) about the news but IMAX CEO Rich Gelfond has stepped forward with a solution that he thinks will appease the A-lister. Speaking with Variety, Gelfond suggests bringing back Mission: Impossible to IMAX once Oppenheimer finishes its run.\n\n“I feel sad in a way we can’t accommodate all of them. I know Mission: Impossible is going to be a really big movie,” said Gelfond.\n\n“Nolan has a special place in IMAX’s heart because he uses our cameras and promotes us. It’s not a matter of us saying which we can make more money on. I would hope after Oppenheimer’s’ run, we can bring back Mission.”\n\nThat said, there’s still no confirmation from either party on whether the movie will return to IMAX so the best thing for fans to do is to rush to theatres when they can. Doesn’t seem like that much of an impossible mission anyways."

        "text": "MI goes AI in this seventh outing for the TV-series-turned-action-cinema-franchise, a genuinely breathtaking romp that tops the previous Christopher McQuarrie-directed episodes (2015’s Rogue Nation, 2018’s Fallout) for sheer nailbiting spectacle and pulse-racing tension. The zeitgeisty plot may have holes through which you could drive the Orient Express, but for pure adrenaline rush entertainment this will leave you exhilarated and eager for more.\n\nThree decades ago, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) sold his soul to the IMF (“no, the other IMF – the Impossible Mission Force”), a covert organisation whose oath demands that its members “live and die in the shadows for those we hold close and those we never meet”. Since then, Hunt has saved the world more than once (his last mission involved neutralising nuclear bombs). But now he’s up against everyone’s favourite enemy de nos jours – a fiendish artificial intelligence known as “the Entity”, a name that will sound sillier every time it is spoken out loud (and it is spoken out loud a lot).\n\nIt’s hardly a new idea. Jack Paglen’s script for 2014’s 70s-influenced Transcendence dramatised the “singularity” (the point at which technology out-thinks humankind) a decade ago, paving the way for MI7’s sentient viral intelligence (“this thing has a mind of its own?!”), which is “everywhere and nowhere… godless, stateless, amoral”, controlling and manipulating information so that “truth as we know it is in peril”.\n\nThe wise-cracking interaction between Cruise and Atwell has a nice, old-school screwball flavour\n\nSomehow, this very modern threat has a very old-fashioned key – a weird, crucifix-shaped dongle that (like Archimedes’s Antikythera in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny) has been split into two pieces that must be reunited to unlock its secrets. “Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to bring us the key,” declares the familiar self-destructing tape, the IMF having apparently shunned new-fangled voicemail or encrypted WhatsApp messages. Later, they will retreat to the safety of an offline analogue room – the one place the Entity can’t get to them.\n\nWarring forces wish to own the Entity, to control and weaponise it. Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) apparently holds part of the puzzle – which puts a price on her head, because “the fate of the world depends on finding whatever it unlocks” – thus sending Hunt off in globetrotting pursuit. The pre-credits sequence alone takes us from a submarine in the Bering Strait to a horseback chase through the desert, en route to a sandstorm shootout with brief stopovers in Amsterdam and elsewhere. We also get an early reminder that we’re back in a world in which rubbery masks are realistic enough to get Jason Statham believing in the Face/Off machine again.\n\nThere’s plenty of caperish comedy afoot, particularly after Hunt teams up with Hayley Atwell’s light-fingered Grace. A handcuffed car-chase featuring a Fiat 500 careening down Rome’s Spanish Steps recalls the Mini-fuelled fun of The Italian Job (with a cheeky nod towards Battleship Potemkin), while the wisecracking interaction between Cruise and Atwell has a nice, old-school screwball flavour.\n\n‘Old-school’: Hayley Atwell and Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One. Alamy\n\nElsewhere, the join-the-dots plot includes a James Bond-style mission to a lavish party where a scene-stealingly cracked Vanessa Kirby warns that “truth is vanishing – war is coming”, a prologue to a Don’t Look Now-style chase through the alleyways of Venice. Esai Morales, who proved so chilling in Ozark, nails another villainous role as Gabriel, a “dark messiah” who is “the Entity’s chosen messenger”. As for Cruise, he may still have the physical fitness of a less-than-40-year-old, but he’s also developed a Richard Gere-style blinky squint of late, which adds a touch of melancholy maturity to his otherwise boyish charm.\n\nThe action is impressively gender neutral, with men and women killing and dying with equal relish (plaudits to Pom Klementieff, whose relentless – and largely silent – assassin, Paris, could give Grace Jones in A View to a Kill a run for her money). It all builds to a frankly jaw-dropping train-bound finale in which the heavily trailered sight of the real Tom Cruise really driving a real motorbike off a real mountaintop is only an appetiser for what is to come – one of the most audaciously extended action set pieces I have ever seen, which left my nails not so much bitten as gnawed to the bone. The fact that this is “only the beginning” is cause for celebration. Roll on Dead Reckoning Part Two."

        "text": "Photo courtesy Paramount Pictures and Skydance\n\nThis week’s report takes an early look at possible box office trajectories for the seventh installment of the Mission: Impossible film franchise, alongside tracking updates for other upcoming releases.\n\nUpdates for No Hard Feelings; Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny; and Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken, plus other forecast updates, are in the table below.\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nJuly 11, 2023 (WIDE)\n\n3-Day Opening Weekend Range: $65M-$80M\n\nDomestic Total Range: $250M-$320M\n\nPROS:\n\nSelling points for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One include not only the critical and commercial success of its 2018 predecessor, Mission: Impossible – Fallout, but the enormous goodwill earned by star Tom Cruise from last year’s Top Gun: Maverick. These two factors combine for a potentially significant wave of momentum heading into Dead Reckoning Part One‘s release, as audiences look forward to Cruise’s continuation of the long-running action franchise and its marquee real-life stunts.\n\nDead Reckoning‘s first day of pre-sales in sampled North American markets registered 8 percent above those of John Wick: Chapter 4 and just 15 percent behind Fast X. With the Mission: Impossible franchise typically being less frontloaded than the Fast and Furious films—and with the fact that several other high-profile films are competing for pre-sales dollars—that’s a very encouraging early sign.\n\nPremium formats should be a strong component of the Mission: Impossible franchise’s box office once again. This is particularly true of Imax, which featured a special making-of sequence for Dead Reckoning running in front of Maverick as an early marketing piece last year.\n\nMission: Impossible films have historically played longer than moreyouth-driven franchises, positioning this sequel to enjoy a leggy run through the back half of summer.\n\nSocial media sentiment has been consistently enthusiastic with the release of each trailer and featurette. Christopher McQuarrie, director of this entry and the previous two, has played a significant role in helping drum up buzz by posting various behind-the-scenes tidbits and announcements over the past few years.\n\nDead Reckoning‘s recent push up from a Friday to Wednesday release, with various preview dates also in play, helps give the film some extra time in theaters—and on premium screens—before Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer opens the following week.\n\nCONS:\n\nWith Oppenheimer slated to release nine days after Dead Reckoning, commanding most of the Imax and premium footprint for several weeks, crossover competition for both premium screens and the adult male audience will be notable. Fallout drew a 55 percent male and 59 percent age 35-plus opening weekend demographic share in 2018, while Nolan’s Dunkirk pulled a 60 percent male lead with 76 percent over the age of 25.\n\nOn a similar note, if Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny—out less than two weeks before Dead Reckoning‘s Wednesday opening—were to draw healthy word of mouth, its chase weeks at the box office could be a strong player for some of Dead Reckoning‘s target audience.\n\nWith the move to a Wednesday release, plus several instances of early access shows and previews, forecast models will be more volatile than when the film was slated for a traditional Friday opening.\n\nAs the first of what’s presumed to be the two-part finale of Cruise’s tenure with the franchise, it remains to be seen if word of mouth will be as strong as has it been for the last few entries. A cliffhanger ending, if that comes to pass, for a 163-minute movie could be a blow to the series’ typical crowd-pleasing nature, depending on the tone of the film’s denouement.\n\nLong Range Box Office Forecast & 2023’s Upcoming Calendar\n\n(as of 6/16/23)\n\nRelease Date Title 3-Day (FSS) Opening Low/High Range Pinpoint % Chg from Last Week Domestic Total Low/High Range Pinpoint % Chg from Last Week Distributor 6/23/2023 Asteroid City (Expansion) Focus Features 6/23/2023 No Hard Feelings $10,000,000 – $15,000,000 -13% $32,500,000 – $52,000,000 -13% Sony Pictures 6/23/2023 Past Lives (Wide Expansion) A24 6/30/2023 Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny $68,000,000 – $102,000,000 $211,000,000 – $325,000,000 Disney / Lucasfilm 6/30/2023 Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken $13,000,000 – $18,000,000 -12% $38,000,000 – $66,000,000 -12% Universal / DreamWorks Animation 7/7/2023 Insidious: The Red Door $25,000,000 – $33,000,000 $56,000,000 – $76,000,000 Sony Pictures / Screen Gems 7/7/2023 Joy Ride $12,000,000 – $17,000,000 $40,000,000 – $64,000,000 Lionsgate 7/12/2023 Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One $65,000,000 – $80,000,000 $250,000,000 – $320,000,000 Paramount Pictures\n\nUnless otherwise noted, all figures above represent best and worst case scenarios for how each respective film is currently tracking based on existing market conditions and projected model fluctuation at the time of this report’s publication date.

For the Hollywood star, there was no time to waste.\n\nIn Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One, Cruise would be seen doing several high-octane stunts, one of which includes riding a motorbike off a cliff and base jumping. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Cruise was asked why he chose to begin the film with the hair-raising stunt.\n\n“Well, that way we’d know either we are going to continue with the film or not! ‘Let’s know on day one what is going to happen, do we all continue or is it a major rewrite,” Cruise quipped. The Hollywood star got into the specifics of the scene and said it was crucial he shot the stunt on the first day of filming as he didn’t want to put that aside and shoot other things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“But preparing for something like that was years (of experience). I had been riding motorcycles since I was a little kid, raced cars and spent a lot of time with aerobatics, airplanes, helicopters, parachutes. But to figure out something like that… It is our understanding of story, understanding of camera, how to do something like that, it all kind of came in that moment. I had trained f0r it, you have to be razor sharp when you do something like that.\n\nAlso read | The eyes of Cillian Murphy\n\n“It was very important as we were prepping the film that the stunt actually was the first thing. Because I don’t want to drop that and shoot other things, and have my mind somewhere else. Everyone was prepped. You don’t want to be waking up in the middle of the night thinking, ‘I still have that left to do,'” he added.\n\nChristopher McQuarrie, who previously helmed Rogue Nation and Fallout, has directed Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, ready to hit screens on July 12. He has also directed the sequel, which will release in 2024."

        "text": "Image courtesy: Paramount Pictures\n\nAfter 27 years and counting, Paramount’s Mission: Impossible action franchise has far surpassed CBS’s original 1966-73 television show in public fame.\n\nThe stunts rank among the most iconic in modern movie history: Tom Cruise’s protagonist Ethan Hunt dangling by wires in the first film, scaling the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in the fourth, hanging onto the side of an airplane several thousand feet in the air for the fifth, skydiving in a “HALO jump” [high-altitude low-open parachute] in the sixth.\n\nBefore Wednesday’s release of seventh installment Dead Reckoning – Part One, here’s a recap of the financials for the six prior films.\n\nMission: Impossible (1996)\n\nRelease Date: Wednesday, May 22, 1996\n\nDomestic Opening Weekend: $45.4M\n\nDomestic Total / Market Share: $180.9M (39%)\n\nOverseas Total / Market Share: $276.7M (61%)\n\nGlobal Total: $457.6M\n\nDomestic Franchise Rank: #5\n\nGlobal Franchise Rank: #5\n\nDomestic 1996 Rank: #3\n\nGlobal 1996 Rank: #3\n\nBased on the hit television series, this opening installment directed by Brian DePalma set the template with many now-iconic components of the franchise: the pull-off facial disguises, the catchphrase “This tape will self-destruct in five seconds,” Ving Rhames as tech genius assistant Luther.\n\nAt the box office, the film came in third place for the year in both the domestic and global rankings, in both cases behind Independence Day and Twister.\n\nMission: Impossible II (2000)\n\nRelease Date: Wednesday, May 24, 2000\n\nDomestic Opening Weekend: $57.8M\n\nDomestic Total / Market Share: $215.4M (39%)\n\nOverseas Total / Market Share: $334.1M (61%)\n\nGlobal Total: $549.5M\n\nDomestic Franchise Rank: #2\n\nGlobal Franchise Rank: #4\n\nDomestic 2000 Rank: #3\n\nGlobal 2000 Rank: #1\n\nBefore the likes of Top Gun: Maverick and Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, this marked the first sequel of Cruise’s career. Clearly he made the right decision, as the follow-up ranked as the top film globally of the entire year, the only Mission installment to achieve the feat. Domestically it ranked third, behind How the Grinch Stole Christmas and Cast Away.\n\nCostarring Anthony Hopkins as the mission commander, John Woo (Face/Off) directed the project. Cruise even insisted that the production use a real knife during a climactic fight scene, rather than a prop.\n\nMission: Impossible III (2006)\n\nRelease Date: Friday, May 5, 2006\n\nDomestic Opening Weekend: $47.7M\n\nDomestic Total / Market Share: $133.5M (33%)\n\nOverseas Total / Market Share: $265.8M (67%)\n\nGlobal Total: $399.3M\n\nDomestic Franchise Rank: #6\n\nGlobal Franchise Rank: #6\n\nDomestic 2006 Rank: #14\n\nGlobal 2006 Rank: #8\n\nJ.J. Abrams made his feature film directorial debut, previously serving as executive producer for ABC’s television shows Alias and Lost, though he would go on to helm two Star Wars and two Star Trek movies. This third Mission installment also costarred Philip Seymour Hoffman as the franchise’s most memorable villain, Laurence Fishburne as the agency director and Simon Pegg as tech expert Benji Tunn, who would appear in every subsequent installment.\n\nMission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol (2011)\n\nRelease Date: Friday, December 16, 2011\n\nDomestic Opening Weekend: $12.7M in limited release, $29.5M wide\n\nDomestic Total / Market Share: $209.3M (30%)\n\nOverseas Total / Market Share: $485.3M (70%)\n\nGlobal Total: $694.7M\n\nDomestic Franchise Rank: #3\n\nGlobal Franchise Rank: #2\n\nDomestic 2011 Rank: #7\n\nGlobal 2011 Rank: #5\n\nThe series returned with a December release date, marking the only installment to shun a summer debut. It also marked the only installment not to debut wide, starting in a limited 465 theaters before expanding wide on its sophomore frame.\n\nAs a result, it’s the only franchise installment not to debut atop the weekend box office. In fact, it debuted in third, behind both Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows and Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked. Yet with strong legs, it finished above both Shadows and Chipwrecked in the end.\n\nBrad Bird made his live-action directorial debut, after previously directing Pixar’s animated The Incredibles and Ratatouille. Jeremy Renner costarred as an intelligence agent.\n\nMission: Impossible — Rogue Nation (2015)\n\nRelease Date: Friday, July 31, 2015\n\nDomestic Opening Weekend: $55.5M\n\nDomestic Total / Market Share: $195.0M (28%)\n\nOverseas Total / Market Share: $493.8M (72%)\n\nGlobal Total: $688.8M\n\nDomestic Franchise Rank: #4\n\nGlobal Franchise Rank: #3\n\nDomestic 2015 Rank: #11\n\nGlobal 2015 Rank: #8\n\nReturning to a summer release date once again, this installment starts with Ethan Hunt and his team disbanded as a government espionage agency. Christopher McQuarrie directed, after previously directing Cruise in 2012’s Jack Reacher, and has stayed with the Mission franchise ever since. Alec Baldwin also costarred as the director of the CIA.\n\nMission: Impossible — Fallout (2018)\n\nRelease Date: Friday, July 27, 2018\n\nDomestic Opening Weekend: $61.2M\n\nDomestic Total / Market Share: $220.1M (28%)\n\nOverseas Total / Market Share: $566.4M (72%)\n\nGlobal Total: $786.6M\n\nDomestic Franchise Rank: #1\n\nGlobal Franchise Rank: #1\n\nDomestic 2018 Rank: #8\n\nGlobal 2018 Rank: also #8\n\nOften cited as the best installment to date, the financials certainly reflected that view, ranking as the top film to date both domestically and globally. Costarring Henry Cavill, Vanessa Kirby, and Angela Bassett, this installment finished the year in eighth place both domestically and globally.\n\nMission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)\n\nWith a trailer playing in cinemas for a full year and two and months, ever since May 2022’s Maverick, hype has been building around this seventh installment for a long time.\n\nBoxoffice PRO‘s most recent forecast projects it will earn the franchise’s highest opening weekend to date. Whether it earns the franchise’s highest final total depends on word of mouth, but early reviews are positive, suggesting the odds are good.\n\nA direct sequel and eighth overall installment, Dead Reckoning Part Two, is slated for release on June 28, 2024."

        "text": "Diverse content, driving revenue through premium formats, streamers on the big screen, and the Cineworld succession plan dominated conversations between distributors and exhibitors in Barcelona attending CineEurope, the annual trade convention for cinema operators which ran June 19-22.\n\nTheatrical is key to studio strategy\n\nHow do you make a crowdpleaser without a crowd? Variants of that question were posed repeatedly during the four days of this year’s CineEurope event – the annual get-together for European cinema operators in Barcelona, which wraps today with a screening of Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny, followed by an awards ceremony. Disney, Universal, Sony, Warner Bros and Paramount all delivered slick slate presentations trumpeting upcoming titles, and consistently pushing the message of “something for everyone”, a wide offering “across multiple genres”, “major IP and original stories” and “films that demand to be seen on the big screen”.\n\nThe theatrical window may have reduced significantly since before the pandemic, but studios sought to banish memories of their 2020 pivot to digital and streaming releases, reminding attendees that their films will be released “exclusively in theatres” – a necessary message in the case of a film such as Universal’s Trolls Band Together (Trolls World Tour premiered on premium video on demand).\n\nTentpole king Disney pushed the diversity message, stating that its 17 releases for the next 12 months spanned all seven of its studio brands: Marvel, Lucasfilm, Pixar, Disney (live action), Disney Animation, 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures.\n\nThe need for more diverse content was discussed on day one at CineEurope on the senior executive panel. Andrew Cripps, president of international distribution at Warner Bros Pictures International, stated that “We’re still producing fewer movies, we’re still catching up. We don’t have the same quality of diversity we had pre-pandemic.” He added that he has also observed a phenomenon of “haves and have-nots”, explaining, “Movies that are doing well are doing as well as they ever did, but movies that are not performing are doing worse than ever.”\n\nNiels Swinkels, EVP and MD of international distribution at Universal Pictures, had a positive story of volume and diversity to tell at his own studio and its Focus Features division, but added, “There’s no question that we need more flow of that product [appealing to specialised and older audiences].”\n\nTalent is key\n\nWhile studio executives and distribution bosses led the slate presentations on stage at Barcelona’s international convention centre (CCIB), the companies as much as possible sought to foreground filmmaker talent, with content introduced via filmed pieces from creators. Universal did this most impactfully by beginning its presentation with messages from Steven Spielberg and a host of others, including Christopher Nolan, Jordan Peele, Jason Blum, Chris Meledandri, Jon M Chu, Wes Anderson, Alexander Payne, James Wan, Elizabeth Banks, the Daniels, Louis Leterrier, and Phil Lord and Chris Miller.\n\nFilm technology companies got in on the act, with sponsorship reels co-opting filmmakers enthusing why a particular format is the best way to see and hear their own films. Initially impactful, the tactic became subject to diminishing returns, as the hyperbole lost efficacy through repetition.\n\nBeing in the room where it happens\n\nWhat’s better than filmed talent introductions? Bringing talent to the room, of course – and this year, more studios made the effort to bring stars to Barcelona, recalling pre-pandemic times. No Tom Cruise this year, despite some anticipation given that Paramount played the whole of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, and in recent years Cruise has become essentially the poster boy of CineEurope. But Warner Bros offered its own TC: Timothee Chalamet, who was joined by Zendaya to talk about Denis Villeneuve’s Dune: Part Two, and then returned to tell the exhibitors about Paul King’s Wonka, alongside producer David Heyman.\n\nZendaya likewise performed double duties, introducing Luca Guadagnino’s tennis-star love-triangle drama Challengers, in which she stars alongside Mike Faist and Josh O’Connor, and produces with Guadagnino and Amy Pascal. For Sony, Aaron Taylor-Johnson introduced the trailer for Kraven The Hunter, where the emphasis was on the fact this is “definitely R-rated” and a change of pace from Sony’s previous Marvel films.\n\nDisney closed its presentation with a live performance of a song from Wish – the new film for the holiday season from Disney Animation, with a voice cast including Ariane DeBose and Chris Pine. Danielle Fiamanya from the Frozen stage musical performed newly composed song ‘This Wish’.\n\nDon’t forget the little guys\n\nSlate presentations from the big five studios were complemented by a presentation from Lionsgate spotlighting its prequel Hunger Games: The Ballad Of Songbirds And Snakes; as well as slates from Studiocanal, Mubi and Creative Europe/Unifrance. Studiocanal got in on the talent act, beginning with a filmed piece with Olivia Colman and Jessie Buckley, stars of its upcoming Wicked Little Letters, and then bringing Colman to the stage. The session ended with director Sam Taylor-Johnson and producer Alison Owen introducing footage from their Amy Winehouse biopic, Back To Black.\n\nSpeaking of little guys, Warner Bros revealed a key scene from Wonka, introducing Hugh Grant as the first Oompa-Loompa Timothee Chalamet’s aspiring chocolatier ever meets – and staying true to Roald Dahl’s text that the character be “knee high”.\n\nThe Apple beauty contest\n\nApple is releasing three films theatrically via studios over the next nine months: Martin Scorsese’s Killers Of The Flower Moon via Paramount; Ridley Scott’s Napoleon via Sony; and Matthew Vaughn’s Argylle via Universal. The studios are presumably under no illusion that they are competing to deliver the most effective partnership with Apple. These titles were seamlessly and prominently incorporated into the studios’ presentations.\n\nComedy cuts through\n\nFour days of back-to-back panels and slate presentations – studios correctly surmised that the gathered assembly of cinema exhibitors needed a laugh along the way. Warner Bros executives Cripps and Danielle Bekas gamely acted in a cute clip in Barbie’s pink convertible driving to the airport to get to CineEurope (Warner Bros showed the first 20 minutes of Barbie in its slate presentation), but really there is no point in trying to compete with Mark Viane, Paramount Pictures International president, who this year was shown accepting an impossible mission to bring his studio presentation to CineEurope, outfoxing an array of known subversives and devious operators (a rogue’s gallery including leaders of CineEurope presenting partner the International Union of Cinemas, and organisers Bob and Andrew Sunshine). Born showman Viane, bewigged as Tom Cruise, spoofed various memorable stunts from the Ethan Hunt oeuvre, and then entered the stage dragging a parachute in his wake.\n\nParty gossip\n\nHours of social interaction among the thousands of attendees gave plenty of opportunity for discussing the footage presented by studios. We are embargoed from detailing or reviewing the content (and sought studio permission even to mention the clips shown), but attendees were buzzed about titles including Universal’s Oppenheimer, Sony’s Gran Turismo (with extensive footage shown), Warner Bros’ Wonka, Paramount’s Bob Marley: One Love and Disney’s The Creator.\n\nBets were taken on the likely global box office for Paramount’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One. The studio will be looking for a “Top Gun: Maverick effect”, adding a halo to the box office, and pushing it beyond the $755m achieved globally by 2018’s Mission: Impossible – Fallout. Dead Reckoning would have a long way to go, though, to match the near $1.5bn of Top Gun: Maverick.\n\nIndustry gossip topics also included the likely succession plan at the insolvent Cineworld Group, as well as, for UK attendees, what exiting Curzon CEO Philip Knatchbull will likely do next.\n\nAt the well-attended party for Vista Group on Tuesday night, two UK attendees came up with the same three candidates as possible successors to CEO Mooky Griedinger, presumably from the same source, which may or may not have any validity. Take it with a pinch of salt, but: John Fithian, who has just stepped down as CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO); an unnamed “former CEO” of Regal Entertainment Group, the US exhibitor acquired by Cineworld in 2017 (Amy Miles was Regal CEO at the time); and, intriguingly, Tim Richards, founder and CEO of Vue Entertainment.\n\nPremium is king\n\nWhile there is a plentiful array of premium formats, technologies and experiences for cinemas to invest in, it’s been hard to predict which, if any, would prove the definitive winner for audiences. But exhibitors still biding their time to see which investment choice to make might consider the consensus that is emerging: premium is king, across multiple formats.\n\nComscore’s Lucy Jones, in her box office presentation on day one, showed how it’s premium ticket prices that are saving the day for box office (at least, relative to admissions), as audiences choose premium experiences, especially for tentpole blockbusters. Jones cited the case of Germany, where the average ticket price in 2022 was €10.09 (up from €8.68 for the pre-pandemic average of 2017-2019), but for Avatar: The Way Of Water the average ticket price was €13, “because everybody was choosing the kind of premium seating, the big screen, the excellent sound, the VIP package”.\n\nJones added that during the pandemic, with venues ordered closed, “a lot of cinemas took the opportunity to do innovation, improving the experience for the customer, which has enabled them to put up the prices, and the customers are very happy to still come”.\n\nBridging the skills gap\n\nThe challenge of recruiting, developing and retaining staff is real and present for many cinema operators, as was highlighted in a panel session announcing UNIC’s new People Programme. The board’s chair Dee Vassilli, chief people officer at Vue International, participated in the session with Phil Clapp, wearing his hat as president of UNIC and the programme’s deputy chair. Clapp highlighted the issue of the rise in antisocial behaviour, which has been witnessed in cinemas (and other out-of-home entertainment venues) since the pandemic, and creating challenges for staff, which in cinemas’ cases can often be young, relatively inexperienced, and ill-equipped to deal with it.\n\nThe specific challenge of recruiting tech-savvy cinema projection staff was highlighted in a session titled Behind the Screens: Bridging Staff Shortages and Skills Gaps in Cinema.\n\nDon’t recycle – reuse instead\n\nReusable is coming to cinemas, whether operators like it or not, as a result of EU or national government directives, consumer demand, and expectation from cinema staff. This year’s Coca-Cola Sustainability Seminar, chaired by the busy and often seen (on panels) Nick Gault, the brand’s away from home customers director, looked at how reusable cups will be offered, either as an alternative, or the only solution, for dispensing cold beverages in cinemas.\n\nNew research presented by Coca-Cola showed that a reusable cup only needs to be used seven times before earning back its cost, even when factoring in washing and collection costs, and that number – seven times – is the same when considering environmental impact and sustainability.\n\nA major challenge for the reuse model is that, unlike glassware, plastic cups do not emerge from dishwashers hot, and so water does not naturally evaporate – extending dry times, and creating operational inefficiencies. Andreas Hufer from Germany’s Kinopolis, which was among the first to convert to reuse, revealed that there are now two German manufacturers making washer-driers specifically for venues using plastic cups.\n\nThis year, CineEurope itself switched to 100% reusable cups when dispensing cold drinks to delegates, and it was notable that these cups contained around 350ml of drink – a portion size seldom offered by actual multiplex venues, at least from Screen’s own experience.\n\nA question to the panel from Screen International at the Sustainability Seminar about beverage portion size and pricing, which currently typically incentivises customers to upsize – hardly a win for sustainability and health goals – provoked a lively response and further conversations during the convention.\n\nOne UK exhibitor told us that a small cup size, priced cheaply, would cut average customer spend on food and beverage (F&B), which is revenue that UK multiplexes simply cannot afford to lose in the current economic climate. The challenge for cinemas is to offer food and beverages that will attract a high customer spend, and retain a high margin of profitability, without incentivising giant portion sizes.\n\nThe elephant in the room\n\nThe studios were happy to trumpet a full complement of releases in their 2023 and 2024 release schedules, but there is a significant threat to future flow of product that did not receive any mention in the main auditorium. However, Tim Richards, founder and CEO of Vue International did place the topic on the agenda when asked at the senior executive panel what would make a successful year. “Solving the writers’ strike” was his pithy reply."

        "text": "Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One might be another blockbuster for Tom Cruise after last year’s Top Gun: Maverick, as per box office projections. The Hollywood Reporter, citing polling estimates, stated that the spy actioner might pocket an impressive $90 million after its initial five-day run at the domestic commercial window.\n\nThe five-day release is because Dead Reckoning Part One will hit theaters on Wednesday, July 12. The collection has been calculated until Sunday, July 16, which is admittedly a terrific start for the much-awaited tentpole.\n\nHowever, the numbers elicited mixed reactions on Twitter. As soon as Discussing Film disclosed the earnings, one of the users remarked that Barbie and Oppenheimer \"are going to sweep\" upon their release.\n\nFan reacting to box office news shared by DF. (Photo via Twitter/Sportskeeda)\n\nNotably, Barbie and Oppenheimer are opening on July 21, a week after Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One. And as per a recent report, Oppenheimer’s wide IMAX capture has Cruise all riled up.\n\nThe Puck report stated that while Dead Reckoning Part One will enjoy an IMAX release for the first week, it will lose it all when Oppenheimer hits theaters. The Christopher Nolan directorial will apparently be shown on all IMAX screens across the US due to an exclusive deal, which has reportedly angered Cruise.\n\nBox office opening numbers for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One leave netizens divided\n\nIn its piece, The Hollywood Reporter said that Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One will collect a solid $65 million or probably more over the three-day weekend and reach a minimum of $90 million at the end of five days of its premiere.\n\nThis will even top 2018’s Mission: Impossible — Fallout, which boasts the titular franchise’s highest opener at $61.2 million (not adjusted for inflation). The Christopher McQuarrie directorial is the seventh installment of the series and is expected to be the best performer of all.\n\nHowever, it seems the projected opening score has left netizens divided. While many vociferously supported Tom Cruise and the movie, several voiced doubts after the popular cultural portal Discussing Film tweeted the statistic.\n\nFans reacting to box office news shared by DF.

This is a smart strategic move given that the Asian country is the world’s second-biggest theatrical commercial market and that the team will save on promotional and marketing budgets.\n\nCruise’s Top Gun: Maverick wasn’t released there on political grounds, so Dead Reckoning might just compensate for the hunger of his fans in that country.\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One hits theaters on July 12."

        "text": "Pick your poison, action-franchise edition circa 2023: balletically choreographed carnage; cars, kin and Coronas; or Tom Cruise constantly one-upping himself in the megastar stunts stakes. Hollywood loves them all. Cinemas keep welcoming them all. So, after John Wick: Chapter 4 and Fast X comes Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One to deliver the kind of movie spectacle that always looks best on the biggest and brightest of silver screens. And, as its lead actor's gleaming teeth do, the seventh instalment in the TV-to-film spy series shines. Like Cruise himself, it's committed to giving audiences what they want to see, but never merely exactly what they've already seen. This saga hasn't always chosen to accept that mission, but it's been having a better time of it since 2011's Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, including when writer/director Christopher McQuarrie jumped behind the lens with 2015's Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation.\n\nMcQuarrie and Cruise have history; McQuarrie first helmed Cruise in 2012's Jack Reacher, and also penned or co-penned the screenplays for the Cruise-starring Valkyrie, Edge of Tomorrow, The Mummy and Top Gun: Maverick before and during their Mission: Impossible collaboration. Prior to that, however — the year before Mission: Impossible was reborn as a movie, in fact — the filmmaker won an Oscar for writing The Usual Suspects. Take the puzzle-like trickery of that mid-90s big-reveal mystery, combine it with Cruise's determination to score the first Academy Award for Best Stunts if and when it's ever introduced (or die trying), and it's plain to see why they make an ace Mission: Impossible pair. With both 2018's Mission: Impossible – Fallout and now Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One in particular, they ensure that a franchise based on a half-century-old formula courtesy of Mission: Impossible's television days still feels fresh and thrilling.\n\nRubber masks so realistic that anyone on-screen could rip off their face to reveal Cruise's Ethan Hunt? Of course they're present and accounted for. Espionage antics that involve saving the world while traversing much of it? Tick that off ASAP. The saga's main Impossible Missions Force operative doing whatever it takes, including sprinting everywhere and relentlessly exasperating his higher-ups? Check. A trusty crew faithfully aiding the always-maverick Hunt, plus slippery adversaries to endeavour to outsmart? Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One gives them a hefty thumbs up as well. Shady forces with globe-destroying aims, being able to trust oh-so-few folks, wreaking slickly staged havoc, those jaw-dropping stunts, top-notch actors: Cruise and McQuarrie, the latter co-writing with Erik Jendresen (Ithaca), feel the need to feed it all into the flick, too. They're also rather fond of nodding to and reworking the franchise's greatest hits. Happily playing with recognisable pieces while eagerly, cleverly and satisfyingly building upon them isn't the easiest of skills, but it's firmly in this team's arsenal.\n\nWhen Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation labelled Hunt \"the living manifestation of destiny\", it wasn't the series' finest piece of dialogue. There's a sense of humour about hearing him called \"a mind-reading, shape-shifting incarnation of chaos\" in Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One, though. That description could also be directed at Hunt, Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames, Legacy) and Benji Dunn's (Simon Pegg, The Boys) latest timely enemy: The Entity, an artificial intelligence that's literally killer. Unlike in The Terminator flicks, this AI is content without mechanical bodies to control. Whether in Russian submarines, Abu Dhabi's airport or on careening trains, it does a commanding job of bending both computer programs and people to its will. The aim: to secure that power, a quest that Hunt is on a mission to thwart.\n\nReturning from the OG 1996 movie, IMF head Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny, Scream VI) initially gives Hunt and company their orders — and once this troupe has been set in motion, little can stop it. So, when the crew punches its \"get disavowed by the government again\" card, they still stick to the task of tracking down the two-part key that The Entity wants. Terrorist Gabriel (Esai Morales, How to Get Away with Murder) and assassin Paris (Pom Klementieff, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) are on the AI's side. Jasper Briggs (Shea Whigham, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse) is among the US operatives trying to bring in Hunt. Back from the last instalment, arms dealer White Widow (Vanessa Kirby, The Son) has her own plan, while ex-MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson, Silo) appears in her third flick in a row to again link in with the usual team. Then there's pickpocket Grace (Hayley Atwell, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness), a newcomer who is accustomed to flying solo.\n\nAtwell and Klementieff are scene-stealing additions to the cast, and the always-great Ferguson has been a standout since Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation. Still, as has been teased, talked about and splashed across Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One's poster, Cruise is the one actually physically soaring. What would a Mission: Impossible movie be without flaunting its riskiest stunt, as performed by its stratospheric name himself, as audience bait? Not a McQuarrie-era chapter, that's for sure. When the scene arrives, getting Cruise riding a motorcycle off a towering cliff in an effort to land aboard the hurtling Orient Express, it is indeed breathtaking — and a gripping, nerve-shredding sight to behold. It isn't alone, though, thanks to a tense underwater opening, cat-and-mouse airport antics, Arabian desert horse chases, Fiat-driving Italian Job-style Rome romps and the high-stakes hijinks on Agatha Christie's favourite locomotive itself. Cinematographer Fraser Taggart (Robot Overlords) and editor Eddie Hamilton (back from the last two movies), plus the entire stunt team, help shoot, splice and execute these setpieces rivetingly. Repeatedly besting past Mission: Impossible action triumphs? Mission: accomplished.\n\nTwenty-seven years, notching up three pictures now with McQuarrie at the helm, and with Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part Two obviously on the way (arrival: June 2024), there's a well-oiled air to Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One. That said, to run so smoothly requires care, aka someone doing the oiling, which is why there's rarely a well-worn moment or element be seen. Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One covers some ground that John Wick: Chapter 4 and Fast X already have in 2023 (and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny as well). It eagerly nods to its own past. And it knows that Cruise could just cruise-control his way through, as could his co-stars, if they wanted. Its biggest feat? Lifting everything that it does, and that a Mission: Impossible flick must, again and again so that seeming routine proves, yes, impossible. There's no self-destruction here — just devotion to an intense and entertaining action extravaganza."

        "text": "“Mission: Impossible 7” Director Christopher McQuarrie Reveals He Considered De-Aging Tom Cruise for a Scene\n\nWhile you might consider Tom Cruise essentially ageless, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One co-writer/director Christopher McQuarrie admits he considered de-aging the ageless superstar for a scene.\n\nMcQuarrie was talking to Total Film about the seventh installment in the venerable franchise and revealed that he had a certain sequence in mind that would have required a younger version of Cruise’s Ethan Hunt.\n\n“Originally, there had been a whole sequence at the beginning of the movie that was going to take place in 1989,” McQuarrie said. “We talked about it as a cold open, we talked about it as flashbacks in the movie, we looked at de-aging.”\n\nThe reason that McQuarrie ultimately decided against it was that despite the technology’s vast improvement, there was one thing he couldn’t shake about it.\n\n“One of the big things about [the de-aging] I was looking at while researching, I kept saying, ‘Boy, this de-aging is really good,’ or, ‘This de-aging is not so good.’ Never did I find myself actually following the story.”\n\nThen, when McQuarrie actually went through the process of testing the de-aging technology out on his longtime collaborator, he found himself too mesmerized by it. “I was so distracted by how an actor that I had known for however long was now suddenly this young person.,” he told Total Film.\n\nWe just saw a younger Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny after VFX artists de-aged Indy by nearly 40 years for the opening sequence. Ford’s not alone. Brad Pitt did it. Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro did it. Samuel Jackson and Will Smith did it, too.\n\nSo, while there will be no younger Cruise in Dead Reckoning Part One, the research process opened the doors for a potential peak at a younger Cruise on a future project, McQuarrie said.\n\n“In researching that [technology], I cracked the code – I think – on how best to approach it,” McQuarrie told Total Film. “By then, we had kind of moved away from it. We may still play with it. We never say never.”\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is in theaters now.\n\nFor more on Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, check out these stories:\n\n“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” Reviews: Cruise & Co.

        "text": "Christopher McQuarrie says he briefly considered casting a major actress for what would have been a small role in the latest Mission: Impossible movie.\n\nAs Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One filmmaker McQuarrie, 54, appeared on Empire magazine's Spoiler Special Film podcast recently, the director recalled that as the production considered de-aging Tom Cruise for a flashback sequence in the new movie, he briefly wondered whether he could book Julia Roberts to act alongside the actor.\n\n\"I said, 'OK, if I were doing this sequence, it would be Tom in, say, 1989,' \" McQuarrie recalled on the podcast, noting that he believed the late Tony Scott (True Romance) would have been a good pick to direct a late '80s Mission: Impossible movie.\n\n\"We looked at Days of Thunder and we looked at the style of it, and we started thinking what would it look like if Tony Scott had shot this, and who would it have been?\" the director continued, according to a /Film transcription of the podcast appearance. \"I looked back at who was the ingenue, who was the breakout star in 1989? And right around then was Mystic Pizza. And I was like, 'Oh my God. Julia Roberts, a then-pre-Pretty Woman Julia Roberts, as this young woman.' \"\n\nMcQuarrie continued to note that he decided he only would want to de-age Cruise for the flashback if he could \"somehow convince Julia Roberts to come in and be this small role at the beginning of this story.\"\n\nFlixPix/Alamy\n\nAs McQuarrie considered his options, though, he decided seeking out digital de-aging — and the fees the production would incur from casting an A-list star like Roberts — were not worth what he envisioned for the scene.\n\n\"As you're conceptually going through it, you're like, 'Now all anybody's going to be doing is thinking about the de-aging of Julia Roberts, and Esai [Morales], and Tom, and Henry Czerny,' \" the director said. \"And then I got the bill for de-aging those people before their salaries were even factored into it.\"\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n\"And if you put two of them in a shot together, or three of them in a shot together, it would have been as expensive as the train by the time we were done,\" he added.\n\n\n\nRather than spend time and money on de-aging all the actors involved, the latest Mission: Impossible movie kept the flashback sequence simple and avoided showing the faces of 61-year-old Cruise or 60-year-old Morales, who plays a villain named Gabriel. Mariela Garriga plays Marie in those flashbacks; she's expected to return in the role for the film's forthcoming sequel Dead Reckoning Part Two.\n\n\n\nTIZIANA FABI/AFP via Getty\n\nWhile the new film did not include any digital de-aging of its principal star, Cruise did perform what McQuarrie once called \"by far the most dangerous stunt we've ever done\" with his now-famous motorbike jump off a cliff for the movie.\n\n\n\nAside from Cruise, Morales and Garriga, the latest entry in Cruise's decades-long action series also stars Hayley Atwell, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, Pom Klementieff, Ving Rhames, Henry Czerny, Shea Whigham, Greg Tarzan Davis, Charles Parnell, Frederick Schmidt, Cary Elwes, Mark Gatiss, Indira Varma and Rob Delaney.\n\n\n\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is in theaters now.\n\n"

Barbie earned another $21.2 million on Thursday for *** domestic total of $258.2 million. The movie will leap past $300 million at the domestic box office on Friday. Barbie and Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer fueled the fifth biggest week of all time at the domestic box office with revenue for all films clocking in at an estimated $500 million. According to comscore the four top grossing weeks were led by the likes of Avengers end game Star Wars.

I'm Tiffany Taylor.\n\nAdvertisement The 'Barbie' bonanza continues at the box office, 'Oppenheimer' holds the No. 2 spot Share Copy Link Copy\n\nA week later, the \"Barbenheimer\" boom has not abated.Seven days after Greta Gerwig's \"Barbie\" and Christopher Nolan's \"Oppenheimer\" conspired to set box office records, the two films held unusually strongly in theaters. \"Barbie\" took in a massive $93 million in its second weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. \"Oppenheimer\" stayed in second with a robust $46.2 million. Sales for the two movies dipped 43% and 44%, respectably — well shy of the usual week-two drops.\"Barbenheimer\" has proven to be not a one-weekend phenomenon but an ongoing box-office bonanza. The two movies combined have already surpassed $1 billion in worldwide ticket sales. Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore, call it \"a touchstone moment for movies, moviegoers and movie theaters.\"\"Having two movies from rival studios linked in this way and both boosting each other's fortunes — both box-office wise and it terms of their profile — I don't know if there's a comp for this in the annals of box-office history,\" said Dergarabedian. \"There's really no comparison for this.\"Following its year-best $162 million opening, the pink-infused pop sensation of \"Barbie\" saw remarkably sustained business through the week and into the weekend. The film outpaced Nolan's \"The Dark Knight\" to have the best first 11 days in theaters of any Warner Bros. release ever.\"Barbie\" has rapidly accumulated $351.4 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters, a rate that will soon make it the biggest box-office hit of the summer. Every day it's played, \"Barbie\" has made at least $20 million.And the \"Barbie\" effect isn't just in North America. The film made $122.2 million internationally over the weekend. Its global tally has reached $775 million. It's the kind of business that astounds even veteran studio executives.\"That's a crazy number,\" said Jeff Goldstein, distribution chief for Warner Bros. \"There's just a built-in audience that wants to be part of the zeitgeist of the moment. Wherever you go, people are wearing pink. Pink is taking over the world.\"Amid the frenzy, \"Barbie\" is already attracting a lot of repeat moviegoers. Goldstein estimates that 12% of sales are people going back with friends or family to see it again.For a movie industry that has be trying to regain its pre-pandemic footing — and that now finds itself largely shuttered due to actors and screenwriters strikes — the sensations of \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" have showed what's possible when everything lines up just right.\"Post-pandemic, there's no ceiling and there's no floor,\" said Goldstein. \"The movies that miss, really miss big time and the movies that work really work big time.\"Universal Pictures' \"Oppenheimer,\" meanwhile, is performing more like a superhero movie than a three-hour film about scientists talking.Nolan's drama starring Cillian Murphy as atomic bomb physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer has accrued $174.1 million domestically thus far. With an additional $72.4 million in international cinemas, \"Oppenheimer\" has already surpassed $400 million globally.Showings in IMAX have typically been sold out. \"Oppenheimer\" has made $80 million worldwide on IMAX. The large-format exhibitor said Sunday that it will extend the film's run through Aug. 13.The week's top new release, Walt Disney Co.'s \"Haunted Mansion,\" an adaptation of the Disney theme park attraction, was easily overshadowed by the \"Barbenheimer\" blitz. The film, which cost about $150 million, debuted with $24 million domestically and $9 million in overseas sales. \"Haunted Mansion,\" directed by Justin Simien (\"Dear White People,\" \"Bad Hair\") and starring an ensemble of LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish, Owen Wilson, Danny DeVito and Rosario Dawson, struggled to overcome mediocre reviews.\"Talk to Me,\" the A24 supernatural horror film, fared better. It debuted with $10 million. The film, directed by Australian filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou and starring Sophie Wilde, was a midnight premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January and received terrific reviews from critics (95% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes). It was made for a modest $4.5 million.While theaters being flush with moviegoers has been a huge boon to the film industry, it's been tougher sledding for Tom Cruise, the so-called savior of the movies last summer with \"Top Gun: Maverick.\" \"Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part I,\" which debuted the week before the arrival of \"Barbenheimer,\" grossed $10.7 million in its third weekend. The film starring Cruise and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, has grossed $139.2 million domestically and $309.3 million oveseas.Instead, the sleeper hit \"Sound of Freedom\" has been the best performing non-\"Barbenheimer\" release in theaters. The Angel Studios' release, which is counting crowdfunding pay-it-forward sales in its box office totals, made $12.4 million in its fourth weekend, bringing its haul thus far to nearly $150 million.Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.

        "text": "The very online showdown between Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” all started with a date: July 21.\n\nIt’s not uncommon for studios to counterprogram films in different genres on a big weekend, but the stark differences between an intense, serious-minded picture about the man who oversaw the development of the atomic bomb and a lighthearted, candy-colored anthropomorphizing of a childhood doll quickly became the stuff of viral fodder.\n\nThere’s even some disagreement over whether it’s “Barbieheimer” or “Barbenheimer” or “Boppenheimer” or yet another tortured portmanteau — a phenomenon on which the AP Stylebook has yet to offer guidance, but for the purposes of this article will be “Barbenheimer.”\n\nIt didn’t hurt that both Nolan and Gerwig have very passionate and very online fandoms eager to join in. Never mind that many of those fans overlap — the memes, allegiances, and T-shirts were just too fun.\n\nBoth movies often trend on social media when the other releases a new asset — a trailer, a picture, an interview. On one level, it’s a marketing department’s dream. Awareness could not be higher, the conversation couldn’t be louder, and neither film even has official reviews out yet.\n\n“’Barbenheimer’ is a marketing gift borne out of social media and I think it’s benefiting both films,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for analytics firm Comscore. “You’re certainly aware of both movies in a more profound and compelling way than I think might have otherwise happened had they been released on different weekends.”\n\nAMC Theaters reported that 20,000 of its AMC Stubs members had purchased tickets for a double feature. If you’re counting, that’s 294 minutes of moviewatching. Even Margot Robbie — Barbie herself — and Tom Cruise, the star of another summer blockbuster, have started plotting the ideal “Barbenheimer” day.\n\n“It’s a perfect double bill,” said Robbie at her movie’s London premiere Wednesday. “I think actually start your day with ‘Barbie,’ then go straight into ‘Oppenheimer’ and then a ‘Barbie’ chaser.”\n\nCruise — whose “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” opened a little over a week before the “Barbenheimer” showdown — said at his premiere he’d plan to see both on their opening day, likely starting with “Oppenheimer,” which seems to be the internet’s preferred viewing order as well.\n\n“Barbie” actor Issa Rae thinks there’s a reason for that.\n\n“I think that there’s a very specific order that if you see them in. If you see ‘Oppenheimer’ last then you might be a bit of a psychopath,” she diagnosed at the London premiere.\n\nThe showdown has made armchair marketing experts out of everyone, quick to scrutinize every move by Warner Bros. and Universal — as though it’s possible to compare two extraordinarily different campaigns.\n\nOne has infinite opportunities for very pink, sparkly photo opportunities, whimsical brand partnerships for seemingly everything from underwear to pool floats, large-scale fan events with autograph signings and pop stars like Billie Eilish posting about the soundtrack. In other words, the “Barbie” campaign can go nuclear.\n\n“Oppenheimer” has the bomb, the alluring mystery and the big screen hook, but it’s not the kind of movie that lends itself to, say, a frozen yogurt collaboration.\n\nIs the competition real, though, or just a meme? Some in Hollywood wondered if Warner Bros. plopped “Barbie” on the weekend as a slight to Nolan, who had opened many films for the studio in that corridor including “Inception” and “Dunkirk.” He left Warner Bros. amid its controversial decision to send a year’s worth of movies to streaming and made “Oppenheimer” with Universal instead. But a pointed box office war doesn’t exactly make sense for a studio that has talked recently about wanting to lure Nolan back.\n\nThere is an unspoken code of conduct: Never badmouth another studio’s film, publicly at least. This is partly decorum, especially when it comes to “box office showdowns” which all will say are a creation of the press and sideline spectators. But it’s also rooted in some truth: The conventional thinking is that having eyes on one movie is good for other movies — you see their posters and trailers and on some level everyone benefits.\n\nAnd social media has allowed movie stars to get in on the game, too. Following reports that Cruise was irked the latest “Mission: Impossible” was going to lose its IMAX screens to “Oppenheimer” after only a week, Cruise posted photos of himself and director Christopher McQuarrie standing in front of posters for “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” holding tickets for each.\n\n“This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters. These are just a few that we can’t wait to see on the big screen,” Cruise’s Instagram caption read.\n\nThe official accounts for “Indiana Jones,” “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” responded with supportive notes. Gerwig and Robbie even followed with a similar photo series a few days later, which the official “Oppenheimer” Instagram account reposted in its stories. Charged with playing Oppenheimer, Cillian Murphy told the AP at his movie’s London premiere that “of course” he’d be seeing “Barbie.” The sporting cross-promotion between four studios — Universal, Warner Bros., Disney and Paramount — is something the film business has not quite seen before.\n\n“Not only is Tom Cruise the biggest box office star in the world, but he’s also an incredible ambassador for the movie theater, for the movie theater experience and boosting other movies,” Dergarabedian said. “And that collegial atmosphere within the framework of what is seen as the very competitive box office derby is kind of a nice thing.”\n\nStill, everyone likes a No. 1 debut, and both “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” reportedly carry $100 million production price tags (not including the millions spent on marketing). As far as box office tracking goes, “Barbie” has it in the bag with forecasts showing that it could open above $90 million in North America. “Oppenheimer” meanwhile is tracking in the $40 million range. Then there’s the wild card of “Mission: Impossible 7’s” second weekend, which could snag second place.\n\nStill even with a second- or third-place start, “Oppenheimer” could be destined for a long, steady, profitable run into awards season. Adult audiences for R-rated movies are not often the ones who pack theaters the first weekend.\n\nBack in 2008, in the midst of the recession, Warner Bros. and Universal faced off on the same July weekend with another Nolan film that went up against a lighthearted confection: “The Dark Knight” and “Mamma Mia!” — both of which went on to be enormously profitable (though Nolan did win the first weekend).\n\nThe bigger worry is that what’s been heralded as Hollywood’s post-pandemic comeback summer has had more ups and downs than anyone might have hoped. That’s putting quite a bit of pressure on “Barbenheimer” to overperform and boost the lagging summer box office, which pales in comparison to the bigger issues facing the industry as actors join the writers on strike.\n\nBut with just over a week to go, it’s still a source of amusement. Even “Barbie” co-star Will Ferrell threw the gauntlet in his winking way at the London premiere.\n\n“I think the world maybe wants to see ‘Barbie’ a little bit more right now,” Ferrell said. “Just saying!”\n\n___\n\nAP journalist Sian Watson contributed from London."

        "text": "Hollywood megastar Tom Cruise has done it again with his new film \"Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,\" which is filled with daring stunts, breathtaking action scenes, and his endless charisma. The film ignited wows from the audience at the China premiere in Beijing on Tuesday.\n\nActor Tom Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie pose on the set of \"Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One.\" [Photo courtesy of Paramount Pictures]\n\n\"We are constantly trying to build on every movie to bring you an absolutely unrivaled experience. Director Christopher McQuarrie and I have approached 'Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning' with that same commitment to practical filmmaking,\" Cruise said via a pre-recorded video before emphasizing how much he missed all his Chinese friends and fans.\n\nCruise visited China in 2018 to promote \"Mission: Impossible – Fallout.\" However, the COVID-19 pandemic and its lingering aftermath have nearly halted overseas promotional tours to China by foreign cast and crew. Despite these challenges, Chinese movie fans have eagerly followed the progress of the new installment of the popular action franchise. The critically acclaimed film is now set for release in Chinese theaters in various formats, including IMAX, on July 14.\n\nOver the course of its six installments and 27 years, the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise has gained popularity in China and holds significant relevance. The second installment was directed by Chinese director John Woo, while the third film, helmed by J.J. Abrams, was shot in Shanghai and the ancient water town of Xitang in Zhejiang province. China has imported nearly all of the \"Mission: Impossible\" installments, grossing a total of 2.9 billion yuan in the country. \"Fallout\" so far stands as the highest-grossing film in the franchise in China, earning 1.25 billion yuan.\n\n\"Dead Reckoning Part One,\" starring Cruise, Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Esai Morales, and Vanessa Kirby, is one of the most expensive films ever made and the most expensive in the franchise with an estimated budget of $291 million. It is also the longest in terms of runtime, spanning 156 minutes.\n\nA thrilling scene in \"Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One\" where characters fight for survival in a train wreck that dangles from a broken bridge. [Photo courtesy of Paramount Pictures]\n\nThis opening chapter in that two-movie arc sees Ethan Hunt and his IMF team on their most dangerous mission yet: trying to save the world from a mysterious, all-powerful artificial intelligence villain with the power to control the way humanity perceives reality. \"The stakes in this story are as global as global stakes get,\" said McQuarrie, also noting the key to crafting an engaging story is by tapping into the audience's emotions, which \"makes that action worth doing.\"\n\nThe most stunning stunts in the film include Cruise fighting on a moving train, engaging in a car chase on the streets of Rome, and, in particular, riding off a cliff on a motorbike. These stunts were performed during real takes, by Cruise himself, emphasizing practical filmmaking rather than relying on computer-generated visual effects.\n\nFor the motorbike scene, Cruise rode a motorbike off a purpose-built ramp on the side of a mountain in Norway, a vertiginous rock face situated approximately 1,200 meters above sea level – all on the first day of principal shooting on Sept. 6, 2020. He then descended 4,000 feet into the ravine below before opening his parachute at a mere 500 feet from the ground. While the director and a small crew breathed a collective sigh of relief after the first successful run, Cruise picked himself up and repeated the stunt seven more times, ensuring the footage was perfect.\n\nA photo captures the moment when Tom Cruise rides a motorbike off a cliff on a mountain in Norway. [Photo courtesy of Paramount Pictures]\n\nThe stunt was undeniably the most dangerous of Cruise's career, which is quite a statement considering his previous jaw-dropping endeavors in the \"Mission: Impossible\" films. Those include swinging around the exterior of the world's tallest building, Dubai's Burj Khalifa, in \"Ghost Protocol,\" hanging onto the side of an Airbus A400M mid-flight in \"Rogue Nation,\" and launching himself out of a Boeing C-17 Globemaster III from 25,000 feet, executing a high altitude low opening (HALO) jump on film for the first time ever in \"Fallout.\" This time, after a year of rehearsals in the U.K. during pre-production, Cruise had completed over 500 skydives and 13,000 motocross jumps in preparation.\n\n\"Every time I went off the ramp, it was dangerous. It was risking my life. And we wanted to keep that to a minimum,\" Cruise had previously said. \"We have a saying on 'Mission: Impossible' movies: 'Don't be safe. Be competent.'\"\n\nAn IMAX poster for \"Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One.\" [Photo courtesy of IMAX China]\n\n\"Dead Reckoning Part One\" also marks a significant milestone for the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise. \"This is the first time we've ever split a 'Mission: Impossible' story over two movies. It's something we've never attempted before because of the complexity of these stories. The scale of these two movies is epic in every sense,\" said Cruise. The second installment of \"Dead Reckoning\" is scheduled for June 2024.\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "Mission: Impossibleis a franchise that runs high on expectations not only from audiences but from the man at the helm of the entire series: Tom Cruise.\n\nUnlike franchises likeFast & Furious orJurassic World, the Mission: Impossible films have stayed relatively the same, providing excellent action scenes, beautiful locations, and melancholy character development that leaves Cruise's Ethan Hunt more and more haunted. This consistency is largely credited to writer/director Christopher McQuarrie, who has written and directed the last four Mission: Impossible films.\n\nHowever, McQuarrie wasn't always there to lead the way for Hunt and the Impossible Mission Force. Brain de Palma, the American auteur who mentored Wes Anderson, kicked off the franchise with a gaudy, hyper-stylized, and tension-filled film based on the original TV series. Robert Towne, who wrote Roman Polanski's Chinatown, tossed the original series to the side for a new story that drew in old and new audiences to the cinema. It was a hit, and a sequel was immediately ordered.\n\nWhile John Woo's film is largely forgotten and deemed the weakest entry in the franchise, ScreenRant discovered that Oliver Stone's rejected take on the project was much, much wilder. How wild was it? Let's get into it.\n\n\n\nOliver Stone's Rejected ​​'Mission: Impossible' ​Movie 'Mission: Impossible II' Paramount Pictures In their Mission: Impossible fan podcastLight The Fuse, host Charles Hood and Drew Taylor go into an in-depth breakdown of an early draft for Stone's planned sequel. Written by David Marconi with revisions by Michael Tolkin, the film saw the return of characters from the first film and an evil supercomputer as the primary villain. The script, which can only be viewed by appointment at the Ron Moore Collection at the Cinematic Arts Library at the University of Southern California, the early Mission: Impossible II outline was disjointed, leaving readers confused as transitions from each act are jarring and unnatural.\n\nMarconi's script opens with a scene that is familiar to Mission: Impossible audiences: during a prison fight, Ethan escapes to Vietnam while following the trail of the movie's antagonist, who seems to be in league with a supercomputer with an appetite for world domination.\n\nThings get stranger as the events of act two play out. At one point, the IMF headquarters in Rome is destroyed and Ethan fakes his own death at an airport in Denver. However, Ethan is then later captured and kept inside an experimental chamber named the Evolution Room where he begins to hallucinate about an escape plan attempted by Luther, which turns out to be an elaborate ploy for information extraction.\n\nEthan ends up hallucinating that he is in the Garden of Eden, where he encounters the Child of the Millennium and debates the nature of reality. Ethan ends up defeating the child, who transforms into a man and then a monster, because of a psychological epiphany that ends the simulation.\n\n\n\nThere is a lot happening in this film that would have been a huge misstep for the narrative established in the first film Yes, Ethan is an insanely impressive secret agent who almost defies the laws of physics to complete his mission, but he is still a man who needs his team. These are films about trust. To throw away that trust in favor of a biblical fight in the mind feels pointless at the end of the day. Would it have been cool to see it? Of course, but that's not what this franchise wanted to be.\n\n\n\nIf we ever get our hands on the script, it would be cool to see where the script shined the brightest and what parts were the ultimate downfall of Stone's and Marconi's screenplay.\n\n\n\nDo you think Oliver Stone's pitch for the second film would have been a success or tanked the blossoming franchise? Let us know in the comments below!\n\n"

        "text": "Paramount Pictures finally released the highly anticipated seventh installment of the Mission: Impossible franchise, and fans loved the most recent look at what Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is doing next. Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One was released to some of the best reviews of the year, and it definitely lives up to the hype. From everything that was released in the trailers, Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One was shaping up to be one of the most action-packed films of the year. As it turns out, the film features a lot of visual effects shots, and that includes the shot of Cruise actually driving a motorcycle off of a mountain. In a new interview with PostPerspective, director Christopher McQuarrie revealed that the film has 2,500 VFX shots.\n\n\"There were 2,500. While Mission is almost entirely practical, there is a great deal of VFX work — removing camera rigs and safety gear, etc. The underwater submarine shots are entire CGI, which was a very big point of concern for me,\" McQuarrie said. \"I am deeply skeptical of purely CGI shots, particularly when they are the opening and closing shots of the film.Special effects supervisor Alex Wuttke assured me it could be made to work, and I was satisfied with the end result. The shot above the ice at the end of the film is practical, captured when we filmed the Arctic portions of Dead Reckoning Part Two in March of '23, just a few months before completion of Part One.\"\n\n\"With over 2,500 shots, many of which were extremely ambitious, it's hard to pick just one. The motorcycle jump, despite being shot on the first day of principal photography, was one of the very last shots to make final. The shot in the trailer is not the finished product.\" The Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning director added.\n\nWhat Goes Down In Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One?\n\nTom Cruise is back as the iconic action hero Ethan Hunt in the seventh installment, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, which is set to make its way into theaters next week. It's the beginning of the end for the action-packed franchise, as Cruise reteams with longtime collaborator and director Christopher McQuarrie for more death-defying and breathtaking stunts. Hunt and allies Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) attempt to track down a new weapon with the power to tear the world apart. Actors Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, and Esai Morales join the cast for the latest installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise, which is set to wrap up with Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two.\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is in theaters now with a second part, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two, in production and will hit theaters on June 28, 2024, but could wind up being delayed due to the ongoing WGA strike.

        "text": "A week later, the “Barbenheimer” boom has not abated.\n\nSeven days after Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” conspired to set box office records, the two films held unusually strongly in theaters. “Barbie” took in a massive $93 million in its second weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.\n\n“Barbie,” the pink-infused pop sensation, has seen remarkably sustained business following its year-best $162 million opening. Its ticket sales dipped only 43%.\n\n“Barbie” has also outpaced Nolan’s “The Dark Knight” to notch the best first two weeks in theaters of any Warner Bros. release. It has rapidly accumulated $351.4 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters, a rate that will soon make it the biggest box office hit of the summer. Every day it’s played, “Barbie” has made at least $20 million.\n\n“Oppenheimer,” from Universal Pictures, again landed in second place with an estimated $46.2 million. It, too, held especially strong in its second weekend, with sales decreasing just 44%. Nolan’s three-hour drama starring Cillian Murphy as atomic bomb physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer has accrued $174.1 million thus far.\n\nThis image released by Universal Pictures shows Cillian Murphy in a scene from “Oppenheimer.” (Universal Pictures via AP)\n\nWith an additional $72.4 million in international cinemas, “Oppenheimer” has already surpassed $400 million globally.\n\nThe week’s top new release, Walt Disney Co.’s “Haunted Mansion,” an adaptation of the Disney theme park attraction, was easily overshadowed by the “Barbenheimer” blitz. The film, which cost about $150 million, debuted with $24 million domestically and $9 million in overseas sales.\n\n“Haunted Mansion,” directed by Justin Simien (“Dear White People,” “Bad Hair”) and starring an ensemble of LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish, Owen Wilson, Danny DeVito and Rosario Dawson, struggled to overcome mediocre reviews.\n\n“Talk to Me,” the A24 supernatural horror film, fared better. It debuted with $10 million. The film, directed by Australian filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou and starring Sophie Wilde, was a midnight premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January and received terrific reviews from critics (95% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes). It was made for a modest $4.5 million.\n\nWhile theaters being flush with moviegoers has been a huge boon to a film industry still recovering ground it lost during the pandemic, it’s been tougher sledding for Tom Cruise, the so-called savior of the movies last summer with “Top Gun: Maverick.” “Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part I,” starring Cruise and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, grossed $10.7 million in its third weekend. Its domestic total stands at $139.2 million.\n\nInstead, the sleeper hit “Sound of Freedom” has been the best performing non-“Barbenheimer” release in theaters. The Angel Studios’ release, which is counting crowdfunding pay-it-forward sales in its box office totals, made $12.4 million in its fourth weekend, bringing its haul thus far to nearly $150 million."

        "text": "It was only supposed to be a meme. And yet, if you made it out to the cinema this weekend – having most likely pre-booked your tickets, rapidly becoming gold dust as entire picturehouses sold out – you’ll have seen foyers flooded with people doing the most (seemingly) deranged double-bill of recent memory: Christopher Nolan’s soul-rattling atomic bomb creation story Oppenheimer, and Greta Gerwig’s fuchsia fantasia toy story Barbie. There were pink outfits galore. There were countless discussions of the ideal viewing order. There were celebratory t-shirts designed specifically for the event. And it all came under one ridiculous name: ‘Barbenheimer’.\n\nThe result has been box office dynamite. Already, Barbie has made $344 million worldwide, with a record-breaking $162 million debut in the States – giving Greta Gerwig the mantle of highest-grossing opening weekend for a female director. And Oppenheimer – a three-hour, often black-and-white historical political drama – was caught up in the chain reaction, earning over $174 million, with IMAX cinemas now sold out weeks in advance. It all adds up to the biggest box office weekend since Avengers: Endgame arrived in 2019, this time split across two non-franchise, non-superhero, non-typical juggernauts.\n\nIt’s not the first time a viral trend has made the leap from internet gag to IRL phenomenon – last year saw Gen Z go wild for ‘GentleMinions’, where another seemingly ridiculous idea (dress up in your finest suits to celebrate the belated return of those sentient yellow Tic Tacs in Minions: The Rise Of Gru) resulted in major turnouts at the multiplex. ‘Barbenheimer’ began from a similarly ‘Wouldn’t it be funny if…’ notion, when film fans discovered that Nolan’s deeply serious A-bomb biopic was launching on the same day as Gerwig’s deeply unserious plastic-fantastic comedy; the notion of seeing both in quick succession seemed inherently hilarious.\n\nIt went from a notion that was merely pleasantly ridiculous, to pleasantly ridiculous and an absolute must-do.\n\nAnd yet, somewhere along the way, that idea mutated, gained traction. Maybe it was the way the memed designs – a figure, half-Barbie half-Oppenheimer, donning a hat; ‘Oppenheimer’ written in the Barbie font – quickly became purchasable items, morphing from a digital running joke into something tangible and real-world, as did the concept of actually seeing both on the same day. Perhaps it was the way that it encroached on the press tour for each film: Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie posed with their Oppenheimer cinema ticket (sparked by Mission: Impossible’s Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise; notably, the trend didn’t become ‘Barbenheimpossible’), while Christopher Nolan called the notion of doing the double a “great” one. Like Margot Robbie’s Barbie herself – and, for that matter, Oppenheimer’s atomic bomb – what began as a mere idea soon became real.\n\nSurely contributing to the ‘Barbenheimer’ blowout is that both films received excellent reviews – after weeks of omnipresent Barbie marketing, a thunderous Oppenheimer campaign, and all the accompanying Barben-hype, the critical consensus for both Gerwig and Nolan’s films was rapturously positive. And while strong reviews don’t always equal strong box office, it had a catalytic effect here – evolving the conversation once more from the notion that you could watch both in a day, to the idea that you should; that each film stands as a triumph from a distinctive directorial voice, and that for all their seeming differences, to watch both back-to-back would mean seeing two of the best movies of the year across one single super-sized, super-cinematic outing. It went from a notion that was merely pleasantly ridiculous, to pleasantly ridiculous and an absolute must-do.\n\nAs the idea snowballed – the realisation that people really were going to see both spurring others on to do the same – it soon became clear that Barbie and Oppenheimer make for a surprisingly great double bill. The Day-Glo colours and wacky comedy of Barbie and the intense atmosphere of doom of Oppenheimer don’t just weirdly complement each other; in Gerwig’s (and co-writer Noah Baumbach’s) hands, Barbie itself contrasts its gleaming surfaces with deep explorations of existential ideas. They are both, oddly, about reckoning with our purpose in life; about interrogating the (destructive) role of men in society; about bridging the chasm between ideas and reality. Just, one does it with neon rollerblades and a Dua Lipa disco track. And they’re both big-screen must-sees – distinctive examples of impeccable filmmaking craft, delivering undeniable cinematic spectacle in a different way to the usual fight sequences of a summer blockbuster.\n\nThe cumulative effect of Barbenheimer created the very thing that Hollywood has perhaps struggled to conjure in recent years: the sense of an all-out cinematic event. It was one that people actively wanted to be part of: to contribute to the conversation of whether you’d seen one, or both; to share stories of how busy it was in the cinema; to see the most-hyped releases of the year in packed houses, all laughing together at Barbie’s most uproarious jokes, or in a shared sense of deep terror at Oppenheimer’s bomb blast. You really did have to be there – of everything to do in the world this weekend, being at your local cinema was the #1 destination. It’s a rare but wonderful occurrence, most recently felt with Endgame’s ‘see it before anyone else spoils it’ excitement, or Parasite’s ‘no, this is really one of the best and most enthralling thrillers you’ll have seen in years’ dismantling of the one-inch-tall subtitle barrier (as director Bong Joon-Ho put it).\n\nAnd that’s where cinemas have really won this weekend: whether driven by memes, by reviews, or by a simple desire to be involved, people have flocked to their local movie-houses this weekend, and probably had their best experience there in years. The lessons Hollywood takes from it remain to be seen – a Barbenheimer likely can’t be manufactured, nor is it a simple case of counter-programming, nor necessarily a signal that audiences want more movies based on historic toy brands or, um, weapons of mass destruction. Perhaps it’s a sign that sequels aren’t the be-all and end-all anymore. Perhaps it’s an indication that allowing talented filmmakers to take major risks and marketing them properly is the way forward. Perhaps people just wanted to wear pink and have fun – and who can blame them? But for whatever reason audiences entered their Barbie and Oppenheimer screenings, they likely left with a greater appreciation of the cinema experience. Your move, Hollywood."
