    "text": "Warning: Minor spoilers ahead for the \"Barbie\" movie, in theaters now.\n\nThe Motion Picture Association has given \"Barbie\" a PG-13 rating.\n\nHere's what to know about the movie before you decide if it's suitable for kids.\n\nNEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business \u2014 delivered daily.

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Barbie\" may be a hit with critics, but it may not be entirely suited for children, depending on their age and maturity level.\n\nGreta Gerwig's new movie, in theaters now, is based on the famous doll and its idiosyncratic history. In the movie, a Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) living in Barbie Land begins malfunctioning. So she heads to the real world with her companion Ken (Ryan Gosling) to figure out how to fix herself.\n\nDespite the fact that the doll is marketed to children, the movie seems to be trying to appeal to older audiences who have memories of growing up with Barbie. Plus, The Motion Picture Association has given \"Barbie\" a rating of PG-13 for suggestive references and brief language, meaning that it's not entirely kid-friendly.\n\nHere's everything we know about the film, so you can decide if your child should see \"Barbie.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are three swear words used in the movie, but one is bleeped out.\n\nRyan Gosling and Margot Robbie as Ken and Barbie in \"Barbie.\" Courtesy of Warner Bros.\n\nThe MPA's rating is mainly focused on the brief strong language and suggestive references in the movie. Throughout the movie, there are a few sexual innuendos.\n\nIn one scene that can be seen in the trailer, Ken asks to stay over at Barbie's house. \"To do what?\" she asks, to which he says, \"I'm really not sure.\"\n\nIn another scene, Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) makes a joke about the \"smooth blob\" Ken is \"packing in those shorts.\"\n\nMost of these jokes will likely go over children's heads.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are also a few scenes where mild adult language \u2014 words like \"bitch\" and \"crap\" \u2014 is used. In a major scene, the word \"motherfucker\" is also bleeped out for laughs.\n\nThere is mild violence, but it's often used for laughs.\n\nKingsley Ben-Adir, Ryan Gosling and Ncuti Gatwa as Kens in \"Barbie.\" Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nThere are also a few scenes with mildly violent fights. In the trailer, we see Barbie punch a human for touching her body without permission. In another scene, seen in the trailer, we see all the Kens fighting each other.\n\nHowever, the Kens in the battle scene specifically do not use real weapons and the battle comes off more as a joke than as a show of violence.\n\nThe movie features heavy themes about gender inequality and death, which parents may want to discuss with their children.\n\nMargot Robbie as Barbie in \"Barbie.\" Jaap Buitendijk/Warner Bros.\n\nThe movie raises many questions about death and the purpose of life, which may be subjects that parents want to discuss with their children before or after they see the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs seen in the trailer, Barbie asks her fellow dolls if they've ever thought about dying. This is a catalyst for Barbie's journey and a key theme as she learns about the real world and mortality.\n\nGender inequality and the impact of the patriarchy are other key themes within \"Barbie,\" especially when the dolls journey into the real world. This may also prompt questions from younger children.\n\nWhile children's films actually do sometimes address death (see: last year's hit movie, \"Puss In Boots: The Last Wish,\") \"Barbie\" presents this theme more philosophically and existentially, where it's more likely to prompt questions from your child.\n\n\"Barbie\" is in theaters now."

    "text": "Like it or not, we are all citizens of the state of Barbieland \u2013 or at least we were on the eve of Barbie\u2019s opening.\n\nFollowing a year-long wink-wink, think-pink marketing blitz that shaded every corner of the public consciousness in Pantone 219C, masses of film and pop culture devotees squeezed into their rosiest garments and headed to the cinema to see writer-director Greta Gerwig\u2019s sparkly tribute to the wasp-waisted Mattel doll. Made in conjunction with the Los Angeles-based toy brand, Barbie is the first of 45 Mattel IP productions in the works.\n\nThe film, which stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling and whose production budget is $145m, is expected to capture at least $90m in domestic ticket sales over the weekend, jolting the soft box office revenue of late. The film shares an opening date with another summer tentpole, Christopher Nolan\u2019s atomic bomb drama Oppenheimer. Projections for the Barbie rival\u2019s first weekend showing are less explosive, with expectations between $40m and $60m.\n\nA contingent of pop culture obsessives have made sedentary sport of the double feature, and plenty of TikTokers have opinions on the correct way to do \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d (save the sweet treat for last is the general consensus). The theater chain AMC reported that more than 40,000 people had purchased tickets to see Barbie and Oppenheimer on 21 July.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time I bought a ticket this far in advance,\u201d said Hannah Jegart, a 33-year-old producer at a design agency who secured her Barbie seat two weeks before Thursday\u2019s sneak previews. \u201cI just want to feel unadulterated joy,\u201d the film lover said of what she hoped would be a \u201csilly and campy afternoon\u201d. Hours before showtime, she was already feeling nostalgic for the kind of event entertainment that has been so lacking in recent years. \u201cAnd with the writers\u2019 and actors\u2019 strike, this is probably the last Barbie-level movie for the next while.\u201d\n\nMembers of the public dressed up for the opening night of Barbie in New York. Photograph: Lauren Mechling/The Guardian\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for this for two years,\u201d said Madeline Warshaw, 27, a design strategist who lives in Philadelphia. \u201cI\u2019ve been dying to go to a movie theater and have something that feels like a monoculture event.\u201d The design strategist grew up playing with Barbie dolls and has been a Gerwig super-fan for her entire adult life. \u201cI feel like the stars are aligning.\u201d After the screening, Warshaw\u2019s group of four headed over to her apartment to feast on a cake that she had baked and decorated with a mess of rainbow sprinkles and an actual Barbie doll.\n\n\u201cMargot Robbie\u2019s hair looks like whipped cream,\u201d marveled Brooklyn resident Elena Mehlman. The 27-year-old said her commitment to putting on lavender checkered pedal pushers and seeing Barbie on opening night is about more than entertainment. \u201cI believe in voting with my dollars,\u201d she said, citing her desire for Barbie to win the box-office war against Oppenheimer. \u201cEven though there\u2019s a sense that women have a big voice in creative spaces, that\u2019s not true,\u201d Mehlman said. \u201cA film directed by a woman and with a woman in the lead deserves all the support it can get.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cast list is so crazy it\u2019s fun,\u201d said another New Yorker, Arianna Mastro, who made a point of reserving her opening night spots at a theater near the Malibu Barbie Cafe in downtown Manhattan. A pre-showtime swing-by at the pop-up saw about two-thirds of the tables occupied, mostly by women wearing pink spaghetti strap dresses and feasting on California Dreamin\u2019 club sandwiches. Also in pink was a young girl by the door, sobbing. It was her fifth birthday but the restaurant wouldn\u2019t seat her family because they had failed to make a reservation. \u201cYou can\u2019t just sit down and order off the menu,\u201d a host told the Guardian. \u201cEverything has to be selected in advance.\u201d\n\nA trio of high-schoolers in Barbie Cosplay had better things to say about the restaurant. \u201cThe Paradise Rainbow pancakes were really good,\u201d said Tee Compton, 17, wearing a pink A-line dress and matching bobby socks. She and her friends, who live in New Jersey, had made a two-day event of the Barbie release. They had tickets for a matinee screening the following day, and planned to wear darker versions of their outfits. \u201cIt\u2019s something fun to do,\u201d said Compton.\n\nMargot Robbie in Barbie. Photograph: FlixPix/Alamy\n\nFurther uptown, at the AMC theater in Times Square, there were no fewer than 28 Barbie screenings taking place between the window of 6.15pm and 12.30am. (Oppenheimer was also showing, but in fewer theaters.) Dressed in varying degrees of commitment (one woman\u2019s fuschia sweatshirt draped over an arm is another woman\u2019s pink bandage dress and heels), ticket-holders filtered in and reported to their assigned seats. Some stopped along the way to purchase a popcorn-filled plastic Corvette souvenir and doll combo for $64.95.\n\nMorgan Staley, a professional dog walker wearing pink cat eye glasses, was waiting at the entrance for her friend, a man who she called a Barbie obsessive. \u201cI\u2019m mostly here for emotional support,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do love Margot Robbie.\u201d\n\nThe energy in a 7.30 screening room, filled to near capacity, started off at a high pitch. There was a note of determination to the laughter that broke out when the Mattel logo flashed on the screen. Then came rapturous cries of \u201cHi Barbie!\u201d as everyone waited for the first actor to appear. Over the next hour and 54 minutes, the audience\u2019s mood took a turn for the less forced. It was Barbie\u2019s turn to do the work. When the house lights came back on, a woman in the front row didn\u2019t budge. She had sunk deep into her seat and appeared to be in a state of unadulterated bliss, her pink kitten heels kicked off to the side."

    "text": "London-based personal trainer David Higgins has been working with Margot Robbie since about 2015, when she was first prepping for her role in \"The Legend of Tarzan.\" The aesthetic of that move \u2014 that is, tousled, grungy, raw \u2014 is just about the antithesis of her of-the-moment starring role in \"Barbie.\" Still, to prep for the perfectly pink, manicured role of Barbie, Robbie went back to Higgins, this time asking him not only to train her, but also the entire cast \u2014 both the Barbies and the Kens. (She got the rec, in case you were curious, from none other than Samuel L. Jackson.) What followed was just about as wholesome as it gets: the whole cast would turn up for workouts with Higgins during their summer shooting schedule in London, and it became like \"a community,\" Higgins tells POPSUGAR. \"It was a really collaborative, fun experience,\" he says, with even director Greta Gerwig and other producers coming in.\n\n\"The gym environment effectively fed into the film; it was fun and everyone was just up for a laugh and to feel good.\"\n\n\"The gym environment effectively fed into the film; it was fun and everyone was just up for a laugh and to feel good. It wasn't aesthetics,\" Higgins says. \"I always find that the aesthetics come naturally when you're working out properly and you're looking after your diet, but it wasn't ever the focus. It was more of a team-building, community experience . . . it wasn't like the superhero movies that I usually work on, where [the goal] is very specific, like, let's create these superhero bodies. Barbie was more about: let's just feel good, and if you feel good, that's going to translate on camera.\" If you had to guess what type of workouts would comprise the \"Barbie\" method of training, you might say . . . step aerobics? And that's not far off, considering Gerwig herself is a certified step-aerobics instructor. But the reality is even more obvious, considering it's the hottest workout right now: Pilates. Higgins, who's also a physical therapist, has been marrying Pilates with traditional strength and conditioning training \u2014 in the world of fitness, a surprisingly unlikely pair \u2014 for about 20 years now. As a PT, he comes at exercise from a rehabilitation perspective. He realized he \"really enjoyed the majority of what Pilates was about, which was control, engagement, and correct alignment,\" he says. But instead of going full-on Pilates, Higgins thought: \"Why don't you learn how to do it all? And you can, because the body responds significantly well to diversity.\" This hybrid approach forms the basis of the Barbie method \u2014 a name he hasn't personally given the workout style, but which seems fitting when referencing his training of the movie's cast \u2014 and it seems like a great method for anyone, life in plastic or otherwise. Here, peek behind the curtain at the Barbie cast's training sessions, and even try a workout for yourself."

    "text": "The fact is, it\u2019ll be nearly impossible for Barbie to live up to its hype. Just as perfection only exists as an ideal never quite made flesh, Greta Gerwig\u2019s desperately anticipated film based on the blonde plastic doll will necessarily disappoint some when the fantasy of its stunning promotion gives way to the reality of seeing the actual movie. That\u2019s the double-edged sword of so much frenzied buzz.\n\nA kind of mob hysteria has taken hold of us in the past few months: the people are demanding cinematic Barbie \u2014 the version artfully masterminded by an esteemed auteur director, starring two beautiful and seriously regarded actors. But of course, Barbie fever is in many ways manufactured mania, with the backing of a Hollywood blockbuster marketing budget. Barbie\u2019s total marketing spend hasn\u2019t been confirmed, but it\u2019s not uncommon for big studios to fork over $100 million or more on major releases (according to Deadline, global marketing for The Little Mermaid cost around $140 million.) After a few extremely shaky years for moviegoing, studios are ramping up to blowout ad campaigns again.\n\nThe biggest stars of Barbie arguably aren\u2019t Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken but the movie\u2019s uncanny marketing team, which has worked overtime to ensure the doll, movie, and brand are inescapable this summer. They\u2019ve acquired an almost mythic stature, spawning memes and parodies of their terrifying prowess. Never mind all the traditional advertising you might see on the street or on TV, as well as the magazine covers, talk show interviews, and Margot Robbie\u2019s to-die-for red carpet outfits that come with a press tour (a tour, however, that has been interrupted by the WGA/SAG-AFTRA double strike). No, this Barbie is all about securing brand deals.\n\nThe amount of Barbie film branded merch is pretty mind-numbing. You could build an entire closet out of them: A collection with Gap, Barbie x Bloomingdales, hot pink roller suitcases with luxury luggage brand Beis, a capsule collection with sneaker brand Superga, more makeup and skin care sets than we\u2019re willing to count, accessories with Fossil, even a full-on assortment of clothes and accessories at Hot Topic, which has in recent years become a bastion for feeding fandom obsession and millennial nostalgia. (Also important to note that Trisha Paytas did a haul vid of every Hot Topic x Barbie piece). Furniture brand Joybird has a slate of Barbie Dreamhouse-inspired seating to adorn your home. In Brazil, there\u2019s even a limited-edition Barbie cheeseburger from Burger King that\u2019s dressed with a disturbingly pink sauce.\n\nThere were some standout moments, like the blindingly neon Barbie rollerblades from Impala Skate, which went viral after the set photos leaked. An army of rollerbladers wearing those exact skates promoted the movie at New York City Pride this year. Or take the surprise reveal of a Barbie Dreamhouse in Malibu, bookable on Airbnb. There\u2019s a Barbie Xbox that looks like a little dollhouse (though, personally, a Barbie-pink edition of the Nintendo Switch would have been way more enticing). If your brand exists in 2023, chances are you did some kind of Barbie collab: a Bumble event featuring online dating tips from Barbie and Ken; a Progressive Insurance commercial set in the Barbieverse; a redesigned Roku City featuring Barbie\u2019s Dreamhouse and a movie theater marquee advertising the film. A Barbie selfie generator went somewhat viral a few months back. Google any keywords related to the film right now, and watch the search engine\u2019s typically staid colors turn pink, with pink sparkles raining down the screen.\n\nWhat stands out for brand strategist Moshe Isaacian is how much of the promo around the film has savvily drawn on \u201cwhat makes Barbie and the movie iconic,\u201d he tells Vox \u2014 such as the rollerblades. In a viral Twitter thread listing Barbie\u2019s copious brand tie-ins, Isaacian noted, \u201cThe devil works hard, but @Barbie\u2019s marketing team is INSANE.\u201d\n\nBut all that hustle seems poised to pay off. National Research Group, which releases box office projections, is now expecting Barbie to make $110 million in its opening weekend. (Meanwhile, rival Oppenheimer\u2019s projections are a more modest $49 million.) To compare that with other blockbuster openers, Top Gun: Maverick banked $124 million in its domestic opening weekend. Over $100 million in the first three days is pretty impressive for a film about a popular child\u2019s toy that\u2019s aimed at adults \u2014 though we do live in a world where the Super Mario Bros. movie destroyed box office records. Not unlike Barbie, Super Mario Bros. also snared a lot of brand deals in the lead-up to its release: a mushroom-heavy Shake Shack menu and a line of body care products with Lush Cosmetic, just to name two.\n\nIsaacian says that such quirky, at times outlandish brand tie-ins are a callback to how big and bold movie marketing was in the \u201990s \u2014 like the now-coveted McDonald\u2019s Szechuan sauce, which was originally released to promote Disney\u2019s Mulan. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing [that\u2019s] different is that with Barbie, it\u2019s not about getting all this movie marketing to sell Barbie toys,\u201d says Isaacian. \u201cIt\u2019s to bring what Barbie stands for to our real world.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been appealing to the gamers, it\u2019s been appealing for people who like collecting stuff for their home, people who love skating, and shoes,\u201d he continued. That\u2019s a large part of the appeal \u2014 the world of Barbie has always been hyper-surreal fantasy. A doll living in a perfect world, who jumps from career to career with no barriers in her way and a million friends by her side. A doll whose feet literally never quite touch the ground. With each new piece of Barbie promo, we\u2019re asked to imagine, what if it were all real and possible? Wouldn\u2019t la vie en rose be so delightful?\n\nGerwig\u2019s Barbie, with its tongue-in-cheek tone and PG-13 rating, is not for young children. It\u2019s camp that promises to hit hardest for adults of a certain generation \u2014 with a cast that includes Helen Mirren, Will Ferrell, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, Michael Cera, and Rhea Perlman.\n\nBeyond the tangible Barbie logo stuff stans can buy, much of the promo has targeted a kind of digital culture cachet \u2014 catnip for adults who keep tabs on art, design, and whatever the latest vibe shift is. Of course there was an Architectural Digest tour of Barbie\u2019s house. The alleged discovery of Margot Robbie\u2019s secret Letterboxd list of films to watch for Barbie (with the likes of Jacques Demy\u2019s The Umbrellas of Cherbourg appearing on it) set cinephiles trembling. Recently, Gerwig did an actual interview with Letterboxd of her \u201cofficial Barbie watchlist\u201d (it did in fact include Umbrellas). The very fact that it\u2019s a project helmed by Gerwig \u2014 whose past work includes Little Women, Lady Bird, Frances Ha \u2014 with a screenplay co-written with Noah Baumbach, was an absurd enough premise to draw an audience in. With their names attached, there\u2019s been a permeating sense that the film is bound to be subversive, boundary-breaking, a technicolor acid trip. Axios reports that almost half a million Barbie pieces have been published in 2023 \u2014 reports, essays, takes, odes to all that Barbie means in the culture \u2014 like this Artsy deep dive into the film\u2019s \u201chyperfeminine\u201d kitsch. Tumblr and Instagram accounts dedicated to aesthetic film stills will be eating good off Gerwig\u2019s Barbie for decades.\n\nIt\u2019s also coming at more or less the right time, in the post-bimbo wave of pop culture theory, which says that there\u2019s actually no need to choose between hyperfemininity, in whatever forms we typically conceive of it (like, for example, wearing a lot of pink) and being taken seriously as a smart, competent person \u2014 that was always an illusory choice anyway. Meanwhile, the platonic ideal of a man is pretty much Ken, a himbo who displays an unpracticed wisdom, and impeccable taste, through his total awe and adoration of the Barbie in his life. You see, he\u2019s the polar opposite of a dude who\u2019ll smugly observe that you\u2019re not like the other girls. A few years earlier, and Gerwig\u2019s Barbie might not have seemed so cool; a few years later, it could have felt extremely stale.\n\nAnd then there are the memes. Barbie fever isn\u2019t just driven by nostalgia or Gerwig heads or the prospect of a big theater-worthy event to look forward to after the lean pandemic years. Hype itself is the energizing pleasure, a wink and nod that you\u2019re in on the joke. The biggest catalyst, without a doubt, is the fortuitous fact that Christopher Nolan\u2019s gritty biopic Oppenheimer, about the man who created the atomic bomb, is opening on the same day as Barbie. On social media, there\u2019s been joke after joke about the movie\u2019s made-up rivalry. People are arguing about the correct itinerary for what amounts to summiting Mount Everest in terms of moviegoing this summer: the Barbie-Oppenheimer Double Feature. We have to ask ourselves, would Barbie thirst as we know it today exist without Oppenheimer? If the Extremely Online writers and meme purveyors weren\u2019t so tickled by the situational irony of it?\n\nTo be clear, the online memes have spilled over into the real world. Barbie\u2019s virality has taken on a life of its own, growing into a self-sustaining creature that no marketing team on Earth could predict or wrangle. I actually don\u2019t know many people are clamoring to buy Barbie merch \u2014 but, according to AMC, over 40,000 people have bought tickets to both Barbie and Oppenheimer this weekend (somewhere in the world, Nicole Kidman is beaming with pride). I went to a Barbie-themed birthday party last weekend, the first in my life, adult or child. A few weeks ago at the Soho REI store, among the Camelbaks and carabiners, employees were conducting a poll asking customers whether they were seeing Barbie or Oppenheimer first. (An REI spokesperson confirmed that the company wasn\u2019t a part of either film\u2019s marketing campaigns.)\n\nWe\u2019ve talked each other\u2019s ears off about the movie for free \u2014 a thing that no marketing strategy, no matter how savvy or well-funded, could buy. The real Barbie (2023) was all the friends we made along the way."

    "text": "Barbie fervor has taken over the nation recently, but here at 1 Up in Orlando, there is a designated place to celebrate the release of the new movie.\n\nFrom Barbie\u2019s kitchen to her couch, to her bathtub, 1 Up has it all. The arcade has an upstairs section dedicated entirely to Barbie.\n\nThat discovery has been the delight of Instagrammers and Barbie fans all over Orlando. Blair Hurley came with a group of friends to celebrate the movie release at 1 Up.\n\n\"What Barbie means to me is that as a girl, we can do anything,\" said Hurley.\n\nFor 1 Up Bar Manager Luke Horman, the best part is that the Barbie section of the arcade happened to already be there. The bar crafted special drinks for the movie release, and made sure to have plenty of people in costume, but didn\u2019t have to add any new furniture.\n\n\"We\u2019ve got a really good, Instagrammable place,\" said Horman. Memories as well \u2013 if you grew up on Barbie, you come in here, you\u2019re like, \u2018I remember a lot of this stuff.\u2019\"\n\nBut that isn\u2019t Central Florida\u2019s only Barbie connection. A local named Ashely Young plays \"Bionic Barbie\" in the movie.\n\n\"They reached out to me saying the Barbie movie was looking for a dancer with a limb difference, and wondering if I wanted to come in and audition,\" she recounted. \"I was like, \u2018Yeah, absolutely.\u2019\"\n\nYoung was born without the lower half of her right arm.\n\nShe says on top of an amazing experience with the cast, crew, and set \u2013 she\u2019s grateful that other people with limb differences will be able to see themselves in the movie.\n\n\"Growing up, I didn\u2019t have any sort of role models or any kind of dolls that looked like me, so hopefully this next generation of kids with limb differences, amputees, they can see me in this movie and think this is possible for them as well,\" said Young. \"At the end, when we wrapped up filming, I think it finally hit me what sort of impact this is going to have. I just broke down and cried \u2013 a bunch of people hugged me in the makeup tent.\"\n\nWith Barbie clocking in so far as the second-biggest release of the year, and a Rotten Tomatoes score hovering around 90%, you can expect to see plenty of pink for a while longer.\n\nSteffani Ouano, another member of a group dressed up for the Barbie movie release has this advice:\n\n\"Be pink, be extra, just have fun. And be a great role model, because that\u2019s what Barbie is.\"\n\n1 Up says they typically do different events every single Friday, but they said if the Barbie one turns out to be a hit, they might bring it back."

    "text": "There\u2019s a new angle in the summer face-off between Oppenheimer and Barbie. It\u2019s over which of the two movies is more politically controversial. The odd thing is, Barbie might win.\n\nWhat might tilt the competition is a single shot in the film, lasting just a few seconds. It occurs when Barbie looks at a map of the real world. Barely visible on the map\u2014but flashing like neon strobe lights to some viewers\u2014is a dotted line in the middle of a sea. The government of Vietnam took that to be the infamous \u201cnine-dash line\u201d that the People\u2019s Republic of China draws on its official maps to denote the maritime border in the South China Sea\u2014a border that Vietnam, most other Asian countries, and the United States fiercely contest. As a result, Vietnam\u2019s government banned the movie.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz careened into the squabble, denouncing the movie as \u201cChinese Communist propaganda.\u201d Rep. Mike Gallagher, chairman of the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, didn\u2019t go quite that far but claimed that the map \u201cillustrates the pressure that Hollywood is under the please [Chinese Communist Party] censors.\u201d\n\nAs the characters in a Coen brothers movie might say: What\u2019s the rumpus?\n\nFor well over a decade, Hollywood studios have taken great care not to offend China in any way whatsoever, lest their products be banned from the lucrative Chinese market. Some of the resulting instances of self-censorship have hovered between appalling and hilarious.\n\nRelated From Slate The Correct Order in Which to See Barbie and Oppenheimer Read More\n\nIn 2012 MGM remade Red Dawn, a 1984 movie about a Soviet invasion of the United States. By the time of the reboot, U.S.\u2013Russia relations had settled into the post\u2013Cold War reset, so the enemy was recast as China. But studio execs, worried about losing the China market, ordered the script to be rewritten to paint the invaders as swarms of North Koreans\u2014a completely preposterous premise. (The movie still grossed $65 million.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFear of losing revenue is why Disney added a panda bear to the Chinese version of Zootopia; why Disney and Marvel together changed the ethnicity of the spiritual leader in Doctor Strange from Tibetan to Caucasian; why\u2014as Emily Nussbaum reported in the New Yorker a few years ago\u2014CBS censored a scene from The Good Fight that satirized Hollywood\u2019s pandering to Beijing; why you almost never see any harsh reference to China in any American film or TV show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe flap over the Barbie map is almost a self-parody of cultural politics. The film\u2019s studio, Warner Bros., issued a statement, insisting, \u201cThe map in Barbie Land is a whimsical, child-like crayon drawing. \u2026 It was not intended to make any type of statement.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn one sense, the studio is clearly correct. The map is an imaginary hodgepodge. The countries and seas look nothing like real countries or seas. The vague maritime border line has just eight dashes, not nine. This may be why the Philippine government, which at first followed Vietnam\u2019s suit in banning the film, retracted the ban upon closer scrutiny.\n\nStill, Stanley Rosen, a professor of political science at the University of Southern California who has written extensively about China and pop culture, told me in a phone conversation, \u201cIt\u2019s strange that the map has any dashed lines at all.\u201d He speculated that Warner Bros.\u2014which has huge investments in China\u2014is \u201ctrying to have it both ways: kowtowing to China by drawing the dashed lines but keeping plausible deniability by drawing them in an imaginary map.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are a few signs, however, that at least some in Hollywood are growing less fearful of Beijing\u2019s cultural dictates. Ever since 2017, when then-President Donald Trump launched his trade war, the China market has diminished in importance. In the spring of that year, Screen Daily reported that China\u2019s once-bottomless well of resources for foreign entertainment had \u201cslowed to a trickle.\u201d Wang Jianlin, head of the Dalian Wanda Group, a major Chinese media firm who once nourished dreams of conquering Hollywood, had \u201chis wings clipped\u201d after Chairman Xi Jinping ordered corporations to reduce their debt. Huahua Media and the Shanghai Film Group backed out of a $1 billion financial deal that they had signed with Paramount just a few months earlier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, each side has learned that the other might not be as vital as it once was. COVID shut down movie theaters in both countries. Once they reopened, Beijing\u2019s cultural ministers discovered that Chinese-made movies did very well at the box office. Meanwhile, some Hollywood blockbusters did spectacularly well without earnings from China at all. In the most notorious case, Paramount digitally altered a scene in Top Gun: Maverick showing a patch of Taiwan\u2019s flag on Tom Cruise\u2019s flight jacket. When fans protested, the company restored the image. As a result, Beijing banned the film. But it has grossed more than $1 billion worldwide anyway.\n\nRosen told me that, even for big-budget movie franchises that haven\u2019t been banned, ticket sales in China have been \u201cmuch less strong\u201d for more recent films than they were for earlier ones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking at those numbers (a cultural aspect of the broad \u201cde-risking\u201d in U.S.\u2013China trade relations), some studio executives are beginning to ignore or defy Beijing\u2019s cultural dictates.\n\nIn 2019 The Laundromat, a Netflix film made by Steven Soderbergh about the international financial scandals revealed in the Panama Papers, featured a whole segment about scandals involving Chinese state-owned companies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis year, in the first few episodes of The Blacklist\u2019s 10th and final season, the bad guy was a Chinese criminal who, according to the plotline, worked with officials in the consulate of the People\u2019s Republic of China in New York. As a fan of the show, I was startled by this\u2014as was Rosen. The character had been featured in the show\u2019s first season. But, Rosen said, \u201cbringing the Chinese consulate into the plot goes a step beyond what had been done before.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was particularly surprising because NBC\u2019s parent company, Universal Pictures, which aired the show, has a huge theme park in Beijing and has co-produced about 50 films with China\u2019s Perfect World Pictures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNonetheless, John Eisendrath, a writer and executive producer of The Blacklist, told me in a phone conversation that the studio raised no complaints about these or any other episodes. \u201cI think China has become less and less important as a market, and as a result, there might be less inclination to follow their rules,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd so we may see more of this indifference to Chinese sensitivities\u2014because of not just loosening financial ties with Beijing but tightening political pressures at home. In April, Rep. Gallagher, whose House committee stands as a bipartisan funnel of Beijing bashing, met with some Hollywood leaders, including Disney\u2019s Bob Iger, and, according to one knowledgeable source, \u201cgave them an earful\u201d on their China groveling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill the next reboot of Red Dawn portray air and naval battles in the Taiwan Strait? Will the new James Bond go after a rogue villain on one of the militarized islands in the South China Sea? Will Keanu Reeves (whose John Wick 4 was banned in China because he attended a concert to aid Tibet) be allowed to make a movie about the Dalai Lama or Uyghur internment camps?\n\nProbably not. China isn\u2019t as big a market for the studios as it used to be, but it\u2019s still very big. It will be interesting to see what the map\u2019s eight-dash line in Barbie looks like\u2014and whether the studio thinks any changes might be warranted\u2014when the movie comes out in Blu-ray."

Then make others weaker with a Q-tip. This makes them 3D and dimensional, rather than all the same strength in color.\" Freckles should go on first, so any product you use shouldn't smudge when you put the rest of your makeup on, said Primorac. Try Rimmel Scandaleyes Exaggerate Eye Definer in Chocolate Brown or Charlotte Tilbury The Feline Flick in Super Brown , both of which have great staying power.

    "text": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nIt\u2019s a tale of two movies and a box office triumph: \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d maintained incredible momentum into their second weekends.\n\n\u201cBarbie\u201d wore several hats this weekend, with domestic \u201cBarbie\u201d impressing with $93 million in gross revenue and international \u201cBarbie\u201d bringing in around $122 million, making it the No. 1 release worldwide.\n\nIt is the largest domestic second weekend performance ever for Warner Bros., which distributed the movie. (CNN and Warner Bros. are both owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d also had a blowout weekend, with a domestic total of $46 million, according to estimates from media analytics company Comscore, bringing its worldwide total to almost half a billion dollars. Universal, which distributed the movie, estimated Oppenheimer will be Nolan\u2019s biggest non-superhero film of all-time in 40 regions, and his biggest film ever in 28.\n\nCrucially, these numbers reflect that not only is there high energy and excitement for movies, but an appetite for the movie theater experience.\n\nPeople dress up as the doll Barbie to attend the Barbie movie on July 21, 2023 in New York City. Stephanie Keith/Getty Images\n\n\u201cBarbenheimer was never going to happen on your TV, it\u2019s just not,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theater Owners in the United States. \u201cYou have to go into the theater to experience it.\u201d\n\nRepeat viewings are also fueling box office earnings. Midwest-based chain B&B Theaters estimated that across its 55 theaters, more than 2,100 people saw \u201cBarbie\u201d both opening weekend and this weekend, and almost 500 returned to see \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d\n\n\u201cHollywood\u201d is often considered interchangeable with \u201cthe movie industry,\u201d and O\u2019Leary notes that there has always been a strong movie theater culture in the United States.\n\nAfter the pandemic ravaged theaters and public screenings, people are now looking forward to \u201csitting in a theater with world-class projection and sound systems, having an immersive experience alongside other people,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d will trigger more and more people going to the movies by reminding them \u201cthe best of what the theatrical experience can be. It\u2019s a reawakening,\u201d he added.\n\nA fake doctor's note posted by movie theater chain B&B Theaters, excusing theatergoers from other commitments until they've seen both \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" on July 21, 2023. bbtheatres/Instagram\n\nO\u2019Leary expects the movies to perform well for weeks to come, noting there\u2019s been a rise over the past several years in very strong holdover weekends. That could be partly due to energetic word-of-mouth stoked by social media.\n\n\u201cAt their core, consumers want to go see a compelling story, they want to be entertained,\u201d he said. \u201cIf stories resonate with people\u2026 they tell other people.\u201d\n\nThe overwhelming appreciation for these creative projects means that the ongoing Writers Guild of America and actors union SAG-AFTRA strikes could be a dark cloud over the these financial successes, according to some analysts.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s pressure to resolve (these labor disputes) because the possibility of revenue is built on the foundation of having movies and actors to promote them,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. \u201cFor now we have high-profile films, but that pool will be drying out.\u201d\n\nWriters Guild of America and Screen Actors Guild members with supporters on a picket line outside Fox Studios in Los Angeles on July 21, 2023. Eric Thayer/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe production limbo caused by a lack of negotiations on the part of studios are leading to a ripple effect where the release dates for those projects will also be postponed. According to Boxoffice Pro chief analyst Shawn Robbins, this means that in the second half of 2023 and throughout 2024, theater chains will need \u201cto keep a weather eye on the horizon for problems beyond their control.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s important to celebrate the good times right now and realize they can be a barometer for the future, it\u2019s just as important to recognize the fight for equality by so many who play a part in creating the content we see on our screens, large and small,\u201d he added."

    "text": "The Warner Bros. Film Group in the U.S. has made a public apology about social media activity concerning the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d meme that has caused major offence in Japan.\n\n\u201cWarner Brothers regrets its recent insensitive social media engagement. The studio offers a sincere apology,\u201d the company said in a statement emailed to Variety on Tuesday.\n\nThe move follows criticism of Warner by members of the public in Japan, the start of an online petition against the studio and an unusual maneuver by the Japanese distribution arm of Warner.\n\nWarner Bros. Japan on Monday posted a statement on its official Japanese-language \u201cBarbie\u201d Twitter account criticizing the studio\u2019s U.S. branch for feeding into the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d craze on social media. The \u201cBarbie\u201d U.S. Twitter account has positively interacted with some fan posts about \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d which refers to the dual summer releases of Universal\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cBarbie\u201d movies. Both movies were released on July 21 in North America and many international territories and became box office juggernauts. Together, they boosted the box office to its fourth highest-grossing weekend in history during their debut outings.\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d has not been released in Japan and no release date has yet been determined. While the film debates the issue of whether the bombings ultimately saved lives and brought international peace, the latest skirmish underlines the continuing sensitivity of the nuclear weapons debate in Japan. By some estimates, as many as 250,000 people were killed by the two atomic bombs dropped by the U.S. on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.\n\n\u201cWe consider it extremely regrettable that the official account of the American headquarters for the movie \u2018Barbie\u2019 reacted to the social media postings of \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 fans,\u201d Warner Bros. Japan wrote in a statement published on the \u201cBarbie\u201d Japan Twitter profile. \u201cWe take this situation very seriously. We are asking the U.S. headquarters to take appropriate action. We apologize to those who were offended by this series of inconsiderate reactions. Warner Bros Japan.\u201d\n\nResponding to one \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d fan art poster which depicts Margot Robbie\u2019s Barbie sitting on the shoulders of Cillian Murphy\u2019s J. Robert Oppenheimer in front of a fiery atomic mushroom cloud, the \u201cBarbie\u201d U.S. Twitter account wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a summer to remember.\u201d Twitter, now called X, added a community note to the post explaining the historical context of the mushroom cloud image.\n\n\u201cAt 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945 (Showa 20), an atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima for the first time in human history,\u201d the Twitter note reads. \u201cThe particular nature of the damage caused by the atomic bombs is that mass destruction and mass murder occurred instantaneously and indiscriminately.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d craze has drawn criticism in Japan for making light of the mass destruction caused by the atomic bombs. The hashtag #NoBarbenheimer has trended in the country in recent days."

    "text": "It was only supposed to be a meme. And yet, if you made it out to the cinema this weekend \u2013 having most likely pre-booked your tickets, rapidly becoming gold dust as entire picturehouses sold out \u2013 you\u2019ll have seen foyers flooded with people doing the most (seemingly) deranged double-bill of recent memory: Christopher Nolan\u2019s soul-rattling atomic bomb creation story Oppenheimer, and Greta Gerwig\u2019s fuchsia fantasia toy story Barbie. There were pink outfits galore. There were countless discussions of the ideal viewing order. There were celebratory t-shirts designed specifically for the event. And it all came under one ridiculous name: \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019.\n\nThe result has been box office dynamite. Already, Barbie has made $344 million worldwide, with a record-breaking $162 million debut in the States \u2013 giving Greta Gerwig the mantle of highest-grossing opening weekend for a female director. And Oppenheimer \u2013 a three-hour, often black-and-white historical political drama \u2013 was caught up in the chain reaction, earning over $174 million, with IMAX cinemas now sold out weeks in advance. It all adds up to the biggest box office weekend since Avengers: Endgame arrived in 2019, this time split across two non-franchise, non-superhero, non-typical juggernauts.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time a viral trend has made the leap from internet gag to IRL phenomenon \u2013 last year saw Gen Z go wild for \u2018GentleMinions\u2019, where another seemingly ridiculous idea (dress up in your finest suits to celebrate the belated return of those sentient yellow Tic Tacs in Minions: The Rise Of Gru) resulted in major turnouts at the multiplex. \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 began from a similarly \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be funny if\u2026\u2019 notion, when film fans discovered that Nolan\u2019s deeply serious A-bomb biopic was launching on the same day as Gerwig\u2019s deeply unserious plastic-fantastic comedy; the notion of seeing both in quick succession seemed inherently hilarious.\n\nIt went from a notion that was merely pleasantly ridiculous, to pleasantly ridiculous and an absolute must-do.\n\nAnd yet, somewhere along the way, that idea mutated, gained traction. Maybe it was the way the memed designs \u2013 a figure, half-Barbie half-Oppenheimer, donning a hat; \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 written in the Barbie font \u2013 quickly became purchasable items, morphing from a digital running joke into something tangible and real-world, as did the concept of actually seeing both on the same day. Perhaps it was the way that it encroached on the press tour for each film: Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie posed with their Oppenheimer cinema ticket (sparked by Mission: Impossible\u2019s Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise; notably, the trend didn\u2019t become \u2018Barbenheimpossible\u2019), while Christopher Nolan called the notion of doing the double a \u201cgreat\u201d one. Like Margot Robbie\u2019s Barbie herself \u2013 and, for that matter, Oppenheimer\u2019s atomic bomb \u2013 what began as a mere idea soon became real.\n\nSurely contributing to the \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 blowout is that both films received excellent reviews \u2013 after weeks of omnipresent Barbie marketing, a thunderous Oppenheimer campaign, and all the accompanying Barben-hype, the critical consensus for both Gerwig and Nolan\u2019s films was rapturously positive. And while strong reviews don\u2019t always equal strong box office, it had a catalytic effect here \u2013 evolving the conversation once more from the notion that you could watch both in a day, to the idea that you should; that each film stands as a triumph from a distinctive directorial voice, and that for all their seeming differences, to watch both back-to-back would mean seeing two of the best movies of the year across one single super-sized, super-cinematic outing. It went from a notion that was merely pleasantly ridiculous, to pleasantly ridiculous and an absolute must-do.\n\nAs the idea snowballed \u2013 the realisation that people really were going to see both spurring others on to do the same \u2013 it soon became clear that Barbie and Oppenheimer make for a surprisingly great double bill. The Day-Glo colours and wacky comedy of Barbie and the intense atmosphere of doom of Oppenheimer don\u2019t just weirdly complement each other; in Gerwig\u2019s (and co-writer Noah Baumbach\u2019s) hands, Barbie itself contrasts its gleaming surfaces with deep explorations of existential ideas. They are both, oddly, about reckoning with our purpose in life; about interrogating the (destructive) role of men in society; about bridging the chasm between ideas and reality. Just, one does it with neon rollerblades and a Dua Lipa disco track. And they\u2019re both big-screen must-sees \u2013 distinctive examples of impeccable filmmaking craft, delivering undeniable cinematic spectacle in a different way to the usual fight sequences of a summer blockbuster.\n\nThe cumulative effect of Barbenheimer created the very thing that Hollywood has perhaps struggled to conjure in recent years: the sense of an all-out cinematic event. It was one that people actively wanted to be part of: to contribute to the conversation of whether you\u2019d seen one, or both; to share stories of how busy it was in the cinema; to see the most-hyped releases of the year in packed houses, all laughing together at Barbie\u2019s most uproarious jokes, or in a shared sense of deep terror at Oppenheimer\u2019s bomb blast. You really did have to be there \u2013 of everything to do in the world this weekend, being at your local cinema was the #1 destination. It\u2019s a rare but wonderful occurrence, most recently felt with Endgame\u2019s \u2018see it before anyone else spoils it\u2019 excitement, or Parasite\u2019s \u2018no, this is really one of the best and most enthralling thrillers you\u2019ll have seen in years\u2019 dismantling of the one-inch-tall subtitle barrier (as director Bong Joon-Ho put it).\n\nAnd that\u2019s where cinemas have really won this weekend: whether driven by memes, by reviews, or by a simple desire to be involved, people have flocked to their local movie-houses this weekend, and probably had their best experience there in years. The lessons Hollywood takes from it remain to be seen \u2013 a Barbenheimer likely can\u2019t be manufactured, nor is it a simple case of counter-programming, nor necessarily a signal that audiences want more movies based on historic toy brands or, um, weapons of mass destruction. Perhaps it\u2019s a sign that sequels aren\u2019t the be-all and end-all anymore. Perhaps it\u2019s an indication that allowing talented filmmakers to take major risks and marketing them properly is the way forward. Perhaps people just wanted to wear pink and have fun \u2013 and who can blame them? But for whatever reason audiences entered their Barbie and Oppenheimer screenings, they likely left with a greater appreciation of the cinema experience. Your move, Hollywood."

    "text": "Movie posters for \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" are pictured outside the Cinemark Somerdale 16 and XD in Somerdale, New Jersey, 2023.\n\n\"Barbenheimer\" remains red-hot at the box office.\n\nThe combined force of Warner Bros.' \"Barbie\" and Universal's \"Oppenheimer\" has led to more than $1.1 billion in global ticket sales since July 21.\n\nDomestically, \"Barbenheimer\" saw smaller-than-average second week ticket sales drops as millions of moviegoers headed to cinemas to catch the popular flicks. In fact, both films' ticket sales fell just 43% from their opening weekends.\n\nTypically, blockbuster features will see ticket sales fall between 50% and 70% after the debut weekend. Second week numbers are often looked at by box office analysts as an indicator of whether a film will have longevity at the box office or will fizzle quickly. The smaller the drop, the better.\n\n\"'Barbenheimer' will go down as one of the most notable and unforeseeable milestones in the history of cinema not just for what it means to the bottom-line box office dollars for the industry but also as a cultural event centered around moviegoing,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.\n\nOver the weekend, \"Barbie\" added $93 million, bringing its domestic haul to $351 million. The Greta Gerwig and Mattel collaboration for Warner Bros. is nearing $800 million worldwide and could become the second billion-dollar film of 2023.\n\nUniversal 's \"Oppenheimer,\" meanwhile, tallied another $46.7 million over the weekend. Its domestic gross now stands at $175 million. Globally, it's generated $405 million.\n\n\"For a domestic summer marketplace desperately in need of a box office boost, the July 21 simultaneous theatrical debuts of 'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' set off a chain reaction of overall box office that has infused the all-important season with nearly three quarters of a billion dollars of bonus cash,\" Dergarabedian said.\n\nHeading into \"Barbenheimer's\" first weekend, the summer box office, which runs from the first weekend in May through Labor Day, was down around 7% compared to 2022. Two weeks later, it's up 9%, according to data from Comscore.\n\nSimilarly, the confluence of these two films boosted the overall domestic box office compared with last year's haul to this point. Prior to \"Barbenheimer,\" ticket sales were up 12%. Two weeks later, they were up 20%.\n\nThe overall domestic box office still lags behind prepandemic levels by around 16%, however. And prospects for catching up are dwindling as studios have started to move big releases to next year as Hollywood digs in for drawn-out writers' and actors' strikes.\n\nDisclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC. NBCUniversal is the distributor of \"Oppenheimer.\""

    "text": "Tom Cruise, the star who is credited with saving the box office after Top Gun: Maverick flew to $1.5 billion in global ticket sales, is now facing another kind of reckoning \u2014 surviving the Barbenheimer effect.\n\nHis Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One tumbled a franchise-worst 64 percent to $19.5 million in its second weekend when going up against Barbie and Oppenheimer, whose dual arrivals transformed into a cultural phenomenon and propelled the domestic box office to historic heights. Revenue for the July 21-23 weekend was the fourth-biggest of all time; in addition, it was the first time ever that one movie opened to $100 million or more and another to $50 million or more. Barbie scored $155 million, followed by $80.5 million for Oppenheimer. No one in Hollywood anticipated such a staggering turnout.\n\nThe seventh installment in Paramount and Skydance\u2019s storied Mission: Impossible series, which finished Sunday with a domestic total of $118.8 million, had hoped to earn as much as $25 million in its second outing.\n\nThe question now is whether Dead Reckoning Part One can level out and enjoy a long run as other series installments have done, and just as Cruise\u2019s Top Gun: Maverick did. Executives across Hollywood, and not just at Paramount, aren\u2019t ruling Dead Reckoning out just yet, especially since it has a better critics\u2019 score on Rotten Tomatoes than Barbie and Oppenheimer, as well as strong audience exit scores.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the story has yet been written,\u201d says one executive at a rival studio.\n\nMission: Impossible pics have never sported mega-openings, yet expectations were high for Dead Reckoning after Cruise\u2019s Top Gun: Maverick opened to $160.5 million over Memorial Day weekend in 2022, including $126.7 million for the three days. Dead Reckoning had been tracking to open to $90 million in its first five days beginning July 12; instead, it took in a franchise-best $78.5 million, not adjusted for inflation.\n\nTitles in the Mission franchise have always drawn a larger percentage of their global gross from the foreign box office. Dead Reckoning Part One is no exception. It earned another $55 million from 72 markets in its second weekend for a foreign tally of $252.1 million and $370.9 million globally through Sunday. It is doing especially well in Asia, where Barbie and Oppenheimer aren\u2019t strong players. And in a number of markets, it is pacing 15 percent or more ahead of 2018\u2019s Mission: Impossible \u2014 Fallout. In Japan, it debuted to $7.9 million, 23 percent ahead of Fallout, which earned a franchise-best $571.5 million overseas for a global total of $791.7 million, including $220.2 million in North America.\n\nMission: Impossible 7 had to contend with losing Imax screens for three weeks to Oppenheimer, in addition to losing premium large-format screens to both Oppenheimer and Barbie. The upcharge for Imax and PLFs is significant and can have a big impact on the bottom line. In early July, Imax screens were dedicated to Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.\n\nCruise\u2019s latest movie, directed by Christopher McQuarrie, cost nearly $300 million to produce and saw its release date delayed numerous times because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was initially set to open in summer of 2021, then summer or fall of 2022. Its release date ultimately landed on mid-July of this year, a date dictated by the shooting schedule of Dead Reckoning Part Two and Cruise\u2019s availability to promote Part One (the actor is known for his global marketing efforts).\n\nAdds another observer: \u201cBarbenheimer siphoned off MI7\u2032s potential this weekend, with Oppenheimer drawing older males away from Dead Reckoning. Not only that, Sound of Freedom is an unexpected force to be reckoned with and is presenting competition from an unlikely source.\u201d\n\nEstimates for the U.S. box office show Angel Studios\u2019 faith-based political thriller Sound of Freedom beating Dead Reckoning for the weekend with $20.1 million for a cume of $123.4 million (Sound of Freedom opened July 4), according to Comscore. Paramount and other studios show Dead Reckoning beating Sound of Freedom; Monday actuals will determine the order.\n\nMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part Two is set to open in theaters June 28, 2024. McQuarrie and Cruise have shot much of the movie, but production is now halted because of the SAG-AFTRA strike in another moment of reckoning for the storied action franchise.\n\nThings looked different in late June, when Cruise \u2014 Hollywood\u2019s highest-profile advocate for the theatrical experience \u2014 urged audiences to see Dial of Destiny. And, yes, two other movies in a surprisingly effective plea. Wrote the actor on Instagram : \u201cI love a double feature, and it doesn\u2019t get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie.\u201d"

Learn more about the opportunities here.\n\nA new AI-generated movie trailer that splices together the wildly-hyped movies Barbie and Oppenheimer into a mashup \u2014 featuring a pink mushroom cloud \u2014 has gone viral.\n\nThe trailer offers a spot-on sendup on the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d hype that had moviegoers flocking to see both movies back-to-back, even though the two films couldn\u2019t be more different \u2014 Oppenheimer is a sober biopic about the life and legacy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, father of the atomic bomb, while Barbie is a fizzy, feminist, live-action look at the famous doll.\n\n>>Don\u2019t miss our special issue: The Future of the data center: Handling greater and greater demands.<<\n\nPowered by image generation AI Midjourney and movie generator Runway Gen2 and featuring AI-generated voices supposedly belonging to Margot Robbie and Matt Damon, the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d crossover took just four days to make, according to the creator\u2019s Reddit post, where he shared a link to his course on AI filmmaking.\n\nVB Event The AI Impact Tour Connect with the enterprise AI community at VentureBeat\u2019s AI Impact Tour coming to a city near you! Learn More\n\nBut as a reporter covering AI\u2019s cheerful, bullish, even fluffy side as well as its serious, sobering side, I can\u2019t help but think about three things the AI-generated \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 movie trailer says about the state of generative AI right now.\n\n1. AI-generated entertainment is moving fast \u2014 perfect for today\u2019s viral moments.\n\nSo, it\u2019s no surprise that as the Barbenheimer hype rocketed upward, any online content-maker could jump on board with their own quick-and-dirty AI-generated take to share across social platforms. A traditional ad agency couldn\u2019t possibly move fast enough to pull off the same kind of \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d sendup to meet the moment, and the costs would be prohibitive enough that they likely wouldn\u2019t even try.\n\nIn an era when social media content is part of the zeitgeist more than ever, there\u2019s no doubt that the speed of development of AI-generated entertainment is perfectly placed for today\u2019s viral moments. Back in March, for example, a Reddit user shared an AI-generated video of Will Smith eating spaghetti on the r/StableDiffusion subreddit. It quickly spread on social media as well as the mainstream press, with one article saying the video \u201cwould haunt you for the rest of your life.\u201d\n\n2. The \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 trailer comes as creatives strike and regulators play AI catchup.\n\nHollywood has come nearly to a halt in recent weeks, with SAG-AFTRA actors and writers currently on strike and expressing particular concerns about the impact of gen AI on their industry and jobs. The \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d trailer is a perfect example: Who needs the pricey services of Margot Robbie and Matt Damon if you can come up with a serviceable AI copy? Why use the time-consuming work of artists or editors when you have the speedy output of Midjourney and Runway Gen 2?\n\nAt the same time, AI-focused creatives who are excited by the possibilities of gen AI are going full-steam ahead \u2014 even as regulators and policy-makers sprint to catch up. The Senate will be schooled in AI this fall with an eye towards a foundation for developing regulations in 2024. Will that be too little, too late?\n\n3. The current generative AI hype may just be a candy-colored wrapper around a more serious, unsettling reality.\n\nThe AI-generated Barbenheimer trailer is, in my opinion, funny and adorable. But the idea that you could wrap one of history\u2019s most horrifying periods \u2014 the development of the atomic bomb during World War II, which led to the death of hundreds of thousands at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 \u2014 in a candy-colored Barbie wrapper and a pink mushroom cloud is equal parts stunning and shocking.\n\nThat\u2019s gen AI in a nutshell \u2014 stunning and shocking, exciting and frightening, dazzling and appalling, sometimes all at once. But certainly, all stakeholders involved in AI development need to consider not just the sugary surface of what gen AI can do, but the deep, real issues that lay underneath."

    "text": "Rafu Wire Service and Staff Reports\n\nWarner Bros. has issued an apology in response to a controversy over popular memes combining two movies \u2014 \u201cBarbie,\u201d based on Mattel\u2019s line of dolls, and \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d a historical drama about the development of the atomic bomb.\n\nAn example of a meme combining \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d\n\nSince the movies have topped the box office in the U.S. since their release on July 21, media reports encouraging viewers to see both, on the same day if possible, have coined the term \u201cBarbenheimer.\u201d\n\nThe cheerful memes combine Margot Robbie as Barbie with Cillian Murphy as physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, often with a mushroom cloud in the background. One meme showed Barbie with a mushroom-cloud hairstyle.\n\nWarner Bros.\u2019 initial response to the mashups was positive. \u201cBarbie\u201d is distributed by Warner Bros. and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d by Universal.\n\nAfter receiving criticism on July 31 from Warner Bros. Japan LLC, Warner Bros. Film Group said in a statement, \u201cWarner Brothers regrets its recent insensitive social media engagement. The studio offers a sincere apology.\u201d\n\nWarner Bros Japan\u2019s statement read, in part, \u201cBecause the movies \u2018Barbie\u2019 and \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 were both released in America on July 21, there is currently a movement driven by overseas fans to watch them together (#Barbenheimer), but this is not an official movement. We find the reaction to this fan-driven movement from the official American account for the movie \u2018Barbie\u2019 to be extremely regrettable.\u201d\n\nYoung activists in Japan on Aug. 1 launched a petition urging the distributors of the hit movies to disavow the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d hashtag, saying that it is a \u201cclear indication that there is a widespread lack of awareness about the atrocities of atomic bombing\u201d and that the social media activity \u201ccompletely disregards the suffering of atomic bomb victims and survivors.\u201d\n\n\u201cBarbie\u201d is slated for release in Japan on Aug. 11, just days after the 78th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on Aug. 6 and 9, respectively. A Japanese release date for \u201cOppenheimer\u201d has yet to be scheduled.\n\nAlthough \u201cOppenheimer\u201d depicts the testing of the first atomic bomb in the New Mexico desert, the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not shown.\n\nAnother film about the development of the A-bomb, \u201cFat Man and Little Boy\u201d (1989), with Dwight Schultz as Oppenheimer, also depicted the testing of the first bomb but not the effects of \u201cLittle Boy\u201d and \u201cFat Man\u201d (the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively).\n\nA number of Japanese films have been made about the horrors of the atomic bombings, including Shohei Imamura\u2019s \u201cBlack Rain\u201d (1989), based on the novel by Masuji Ibuse, and the animated feature \u201cBarefoot Gen\u201d (1983), based on the manga by Keiji Nakazawa.\n\nMiho Tanaka, 28, one of the activists behind the signature campaign, said she felt \u201ca mixture of anger, sadness and resignation\u201d upon seeing the memes.\n\n\u201cI feel like atomic bomb survivors have experienced things like this many times, but even so, I felt I don\u2019t want them to have to see these images,\u201d she said.\n\nTanaka, however, said that the campaign has no problem with the existence of an Oppenheimer film, and she expressed admiration that the story could be the subject of popular art.\n\n\u201cI was really surprised the U.S., Hollywood no less, could produce a film like that and show it domestically. That it could make a film that would create debate about nuclear weapons is a great thing,\u201d she said.\n\nIn Los Angeles, anti-nuclear activist Tsukuru Fors posted one of the memes on social media and said, \u201cJokes and memes that are being made about the movies \u2018Barbie\u2019 & \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 are not OK. I don\u2019t need to tell you; I hope it is obvious. It is great that people are \u2018excited\u2019 about \u2018Oppenheimer.\u2019 I hope that people will go see the movie and that it will somehow motivate them to advocate for the abolishment of nuclear weapons. (Neither the U.S. nor Japanese government has signed/ratified the TPNW, Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.)\n\n\u201cI just think that this insensitivity is what happens when the voices/stories of the victims are conveniently eliminated/hidden away from the narrative. That is why it is my/our job to amplify the voices/stories of the victims whenever possible. I owe it to the people of Hiroshima, who gave me the sense of belonging in my formative, teenage years. I owe it to 350 young girls at my high school who lost their lives on Aug. 6, 1945.\n\n\u201cThe A-bomb of Hiroshima and Nagasaki collectively took more than 200,000 lives within a few months. Many had to witness their loved ones die in front of their eyes. In fact, many had to leave their loved ones behind while they screamed for help. Many could not find the remains of their loved ones, because they either instantly evaporated, incinerated, or turned unrecognizable.\n\n\u201cThe A-bombs caused intergenerational traumas that affect people to this day. And let\u2019s not forget that nuclear atrocities neither began nor ended with Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Please remember hibakusha (victims of nuclear atrocities worldwide) \u2026\n\n\u201cThis summer, please go and seek out the stories told in the victims\u2019 voices. Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum has an excellent online database where you can find drawings by survivors, which would leave you overwhelmed but give you the sense of the gravity of the atrocity \u2026.\n\n\u201cI know that some people are so excited about the movies and want to tell the world to go and watch them both, but these jokes and memes are NOT the way to do it.\u201d"

More than half of Germany\u2019s monitoring stations, in particular sewage plants, have indicated a rise in viral load detected in wastewater this month.\n\nThe number of official test results shows the rate to be low, at 3 in every 100,000 people. However, the figure itself is hardly a reflection of the real rate, as so few tests are being carried out.\n\n\u201cIt could be that we\u2019re having a summer wave,\u201d Timo Ulrichs an epidemiologist at the Berlin Akkon University of Human Sciences, told the news portal Spiegel, adding that the so-called \u201cBarbenheimer effect\u201d was capable of boosting the numbers.\n\nGermany was among the countries where cinemagoers were encouraged to go to watch the blockbuster films Barbie and Oppenheimer as a double feature, in an effort to boost cinema attendance which has yet to recover since the pandemic. So far just under 4 million have seen Barbie, and more than 2.5 million Oppenheimer.\n\nThe idea of a Barbenheimer effect on the spread of the virus was first playfully mooted by the vaccine expert Peter Hotez of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.\n\nSuggesting on Twitter that it might be of concern, due to the millions of people surging to cinemas and spending hours in a windowless room together, he concluded: \u201cWe\u2019ll probably never know since no one seems to be keeping track of such things any more.\u201d\n\nNew York has recently recorded a doubling in hospitalisations due to the EG.5 Eris variant of Omicron, which the World Health Organization last week classified as a \u201cvariant of interest\u201d.\n\nHotez urged people to keep up with their boosters and wear a pink medical mask \u2013 in a nod to Barbie \u2013 if they were planning a cinema visit.\n\nGermany\u2019s health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said in reaction to rising levels elsewhere in the world, and the increase in Germany, where the XBB.1.5 variant is currently responsible for most new infections: \u201cour early warning system is activated\u201d.\n\nGermans are being encouraged to get booster jabs in the autumn, if they belong to a higher-risk group, such as those over 60, and people who are overweight, suffer from a lung disease such as COPD, or work in a risky environment such as a hospital. Those who are sick are being advised to stay at home."

Subscribe to The Daily Beast\u2019s Obsessed See Skip newsletter here and get the latest show and movie recommendations every Tuesday.\n\nThere are roughly 47,000\u2014oh, wait, a new Netflix Original just dropped; make that 47,001\u2014TV shows and movies coming out each week. At Obsessed, we consider it our social duty to help you see the best and skip the rest.\n\nWe\u2019ve already got a variety of in-depth, exclusive coverage on all of your streaming favorites and new releases, but sometimes what you\u2019re looking for is a simple Do or Don\u2019t. That\u2019s why we created See/Skip, to tell you exactly what our writers think you should See and what you can Skip from the past week\u2019s crowded entertainment landscape.\n\nSee: Oppenheimer\n\nOppenheimer is a harrowing marvel on every level, that doesn\u2019t so much wear its three-hour runtime as justify it repeatedly. Perfected down to the minute details, it solidifies the film as director Christopher Nolan\u2019s best, and perhaps his most insurmountable.\n\nHere\u2019s Nick Schager\u2019s take:\n\n\u201cChristopher Nolan\u2019s cinema is one of dualities: between knowledge and ignorance (Memento); seeing and sightlessness (Insomnia); good and evil (The Dark Knight); illusion and authenticity (The Prestige); dreaming and waking (Inception); courage and cowardice (Dunkirk); and the past and the present (Tenet). In that regard, Oppenheimer\u2014a film of endless contrasts and contradictions\u2014is the fullest expression of the writer/director\u2019s artistry to date.\n\nPropelled by the inexorable march of progress and imagination and electrified by the terrible thrill of theories, dreams, and miracles realized in all their devastating glory, it\u2019s a divided epic of awe and horror, fission and fusion. It\u2019s simultaneously a unified portrait of a conflicted man and a singular achievement for Hollywood\u2019s reigning blockbuster auteur.\n\nAdapted from Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning 2005 biography American Prometheus, Oppenheimer (July 21, in theaters) begins with images of raindrops falling on a pond\u2019s surface and fiery detonations in the void\u2014the first of innumerable opposing visions that are in unlikely harmony, or at least uneasy coexistence, in Nolan\u2019s masterpiece.\n\nAn individual of myriad paradoxes, Cillian Murphy\u2019s J. Robert Oppenheimer is a scientist (and the father of theoretical physics in the United States) who adores art and culture; a towering intellectual who\u2019s incompetent in the laboratory; an arrogant leader who\u2019s unwilling to fight; a devoted lover and partner who\u2019s habitually unfaithful; and the architect of modern annihilation who wants to foster global peace. When, early in his academic career, he\u2019s drawn to quantum physics, because it suggests that the impossible\u2014namely, that light is both a wave and a particle\u2014is true, it\u2019s a telling snapshot of his inherent attraction to the irreconcilable.\u201d\n\nRead more.\n\nSee: Barbie\n\nBarbie makes the plastic way more than just fantastic; Greta Gewig\u2019s film reaches new heights for mainstream cinema, proving that it\u2019s not necessary to sacrifice a story\u2019s empathetic soul just because its main character comes in a box.\n\nHere\u2019s Coleman Spilde\u2019s take:\n\n\u201cWith all of the chatter regarding the Barbie movie for the last four years, the most pressing question has ended up being whether Greta Gerwig\u2019s film could exceed the insurmountable hype surrounding it. There was an influx of candid set photos, multiple trailers and pre-release clips, and massively popular memes that quickly created a level of fatigue that was just as ubiquitous as the Barbie poster generator. Barbie was a sensation long before we were close enough to see the radiant pink glow of its looming July 21 release date. Surely, no matter how good the film was, it could never fully live up to that amount of sheer anticipation.\n\nBut to settle for tempered expectations is simply not the Barbie way. Barbie can be a doctor, a CEO, a politician, and even a damn mermaid. The sky's the limit for Barbie\u2014scratch that; she\u2019ll become an astronaut and defy that restriction too. With all of these achievements under Barbie\u2019s belt, who better to bring her story to the big screen than Gerwig? In her career as a writer and a director, Gerwig has crafted exceptional, singular films that brilliantly assess the subtleties of womanhood. No one is quite so adept at making the ultra-specific feel universal.\u201d\n\nRead more.\n\nSkip: Futurama\n\nFuturama\u2019s third reboot revives the iconic animated comedy for another blast through space and time, but the new season\u2019s futurist satire of the 2020s often feels one-note, relying on references to the show\u2019s substantially more impressive original run.\n\nHere\u2019s Allegra Frank\u2019s take:\n\n\u201cAmong the countless Simpsons jokes I think about on a near-constant basis, perhaps none comes to mind more often than \u2018Moe gets a cell phone.\u2019 In Season 13 of The Simpsons, the show was already well-aware of its own waning critical reception. It lampooned its longevity\u2014which, 21 seasons later, has only become even more surprising\u2014with a self-mocking song performed by NRBQ about how \u2018they\u2019ll never stop the Simpsons\u2019: \u2018Have no fears, we\u2019ve got stories for years,\u2019 it goes. \u2018Like Marge becomes a robot! Maybe Moe gets a cell phone! Has Bart ever owned a bear?\u2019\n\n\u2018Moe gets a cell phone\u2019 is a wildly threadbare premise for an episode, but if The Simpsons were to continue forever, threadbare premises would have to do. All three of the joking predictions in that song have since come true; Moe got himself a flip phone, and Bart prank-texted him on it. For as often as fans try to argue that The Simpsons is \u2018still good,\u2019 \u2018They\u2019ll Never Stop the Simpsons\u2019 became not a joke, but an ironic prophecy\u2014a testament to how a good thing doesn\u2019t need to live forever. This was top of mind as I watched Hulu\u2019s reboot of Futurama, The Simpsons\u2019 sister series and perhaps the most immortal television show of the 21st century.\u201d\n\nRead more.\n\nSee: Harley Quinn Season 4\n\nHarley Quinn Season 4 takes the off-the-wall animated series further than ever. The show\u2019s gloriously cheeky nature still pops with this season\u2019s raunchy humor, but it's Harley\u2019s search for personal growth that makes the series more than just vulgar hilarity.\n\nHere\u2019s Laura Bradley\u2019s take:\n\n\u201cAll around the Bat Cave in Harley Quinn, you\u2019ll find details designed to remind you of the Bat Family\u2019s one rule. The pillowcase, the WiFi password, and even the singing fish on the wall all want observers to remember that in this crew, \u2018We Don\u2019t Kill.\u2019 As reasonable an edict as that might be for a group of vigilantes, and as reformed as the Joker\u2019s former sidekick has become, that demand proves difficult for our newly minted \u2018hero.\u2019\n\nWhen she first embraced her main-character energy at the start of Harley Quinn, Kaley Cuoco\u2019s pigtailed harlequin wanted nothing more than to become the empress of darkness\u2014or, at least, a card-carrying Legion of Doom member. By the end of Season 3, however, she\u2019d switched sides to fight with the good guys, even as her girlfriend, Poison Ivy (Lake Bell) took over the villainous group as CEO. Now, as Season 4 kicks off with four episodes on Max starting July 27, the couple\u2019s professional goals could not be further apart.\u201d\n\nRead more.\n\nSign up for our See Skip newsletter here to find out which new shows and movies are worth watching, and which aren\u2019t."

The audience was 65 percent female. \u201cFor a film this pink, you would have expected the audience to be closer to 90 percent female \u2014 we got a ton of guys,\u201d said Jeff Goldstein, president of domestic distribution at Warner Bros. \u201cIt exploded everywhere: large markets, small markets, coast to coast.\u201d\n\nImage Harrison Hood, 24, arrived at the AMC Kips Bay theater in Manhattan wearing \u201cBarbie\u201d regalia. Credit... Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times\n\nSome theaters seemed to be caught off guard. One high-end theater in the Washington, D.C. suburbs went all out on promotion, with pink lights to highlight \u201cBarbie\u201d and a wall of movie posters featuring both films. But the theater may have miscalculated Saturday attendance. By the 10 p.m. showing, it had run out of multiple food items. It also lacked soft drinks and, amazingly, ice.\n\nAnother theater in Arlington, Va., had it worse: The air conditioning went out, leading to a sweltering experience. While the theater offered refunds, many ticket buyers stayed.\n\nThe question now is whether Hollywood can keep the momentum going. Studio executives have long pointed out that moviegoing begets moviegoing \u2014 that the habit of watching movies in theaters is crucial. Coming up, however, studios are facing another crisis: A strike by unionized actors, which started on July 14, could force movie companies to push back coming films because striking stars cannot take part in publicity campaigns. \u201cChallengers,\u201d a sports drama involving a love triangle and starring Zendaya, has already been pushed from September to April.\n\nThere are no talks scheduled between SAG-AFTRA, as the actors\u2019 union is known, and studios.\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d helped fuel \u201cBarbie\u201d and vice versa, with their simultaneous release nicknamed Barbenheimer and movie fans captivated by their wild incongruity. Nolan\u2019s film, which cost Universal Pictures at least $100 million to make, not including a megawatt marketing campaign, is a three-hour period drama about Robert Oppenheimer, the man known as \u201cthe father of the atomic bomb.\u201d About 200,000 people purchased tickets to see \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d as a double feature, according to the National Association of Theater Owners, a trade organization."

Fans have made double and triple trips to go watch the movie in theaters again and again. But some people around the world they're only now getting a chance to book their tickets to Barbieland. The Margot Robbie starrer is finally released in Japan, after a huge controversy related to Barbenheimer memes. Here's what happened.\n\nBarbie releases in Japan after Barbenheimer controversy\n\nTickets for Babrie are flying off the shelf in Japan. The Greta Gerwig Directorial, fortunately, clashed with a national holiday in Japan that marks the start of the extended summer holiday week in the country, prompting many people to go out for a movie night. The viral trend of \"Barbenheimer\" stirred controversy in Japan, as the country had recently commemorated the 78th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In the now-deleted post on Twitter, Warner Bros. marketing account for Barbie had started posting fan-made memes which showed Robbie alongside Oppenheimer's Cillian Murphy merged with the images of nuclear explosions.\n\nThe outrage was so intense that at one point a petition was made on Change.org urging Warner Bros and Universal Pictures, the studio behind Oppenheimer, to stop using the #Barbenheimer on social media. During that period, #NoBarbenheimer gained traction in the East Asian country leading Warner's Japan division to publicly criticize its U.S. counterpart, prompting the latter to issue an apology the following week. Despite the controversy, Japanese fans of the film expressed that the situation did not deter them from wanting to watch the movie in theaters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nALSO READ: Oppenheimer star Cillian Murphy open to playing Ken in Barbie sequel; praises Barbenheimer\n\nNo Oppenheimer release date in sight\n\nWhile fans were finally able to see Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling's Barbie on the big screens, the same cannot be said for Christopher Nolan's movie. No official release date for Oppenheimer has been made public in Japan. The Cillian Murphy starrer has faced criticism for its limited acknowledgment of the devastating impact of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, which resulted in the loss of over 200,000 lives.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbie has taken over the world, quite literally, you can't possibly scroll on social media for 2 minutes without coming across at least 1 post about the movie.\n\nALSO READ: Why did Warner Bros apologize to Japanese division over Barbenheimer meme?

After a successful opening weekend of his own, Tom Cruise just might be flopping in the face of these unlikely twin movies, officially born on July 21, that are ushering in a palpably exciting cinematic moment. Before arriving, I had a stray thought that maybe Barbenheimer exists only in the hearts of the terminally online, hyped up by media people such as myself but not really going to make as much noise IRL. Like, fine, the National Association of Theatre Owners is projecting that more than 200,000 moviegoers will do the double feature, per the Wrap, but that doesn\u2019t mean much to someone who hasn\u2019t taken a math class since 12th grade. Cruise may be under the impression that he\u2019s cinema\u2019s one true savior, brought to this earth to base-jump off cliffs and scale the Burj Khalifa to atone for our sins and sell seats to people who don\u2019t really go to the movies anymore. But today, based on the neon-pink evidence at Manhattan\u2019s AMC Lincoln Square, moviegoers don\u2019t want to be saved. They want to be Barbenheimed.\n\nIt\u2019s July 20, around 5:45 p.m., and everyone\u2019s here for Greta Gerwig\u2019s pink psychedelics or Christopher Nolan\u2019s movie about a man in a porkpie hat. Kathleen Mukamal is doing the double feature alone. \u201cI\u2019m the same age as Barbie, you know,\u201d she explains to me, wearing head-to-toe pink. \u201cThey say she was born months after me. I\u2019m late in \u201958. She\u2019s \u201959.\u201d Mukamal\u2019s fit matches the bandanna worn by her slayful Yorkshire terrier, Ruby, who\u2019s attending the screening with her owner. It\u2019s Oppenheimer first and then Barbie for her \u201cbecause it was just what was available,\u201d she says. \u201cI got the front seat in each row. You know, the last seats that were available.\u201d\n\nRuby and her owner, Kathleen Mukamal. Photo: Zoe Guy\n\nWhile loitering in the lobby, I\u2019m confronted by an invasion of every shade of pink \u2014 fuchsia and coral and bubblegum and ballet slipper \u2014 all marching in lockstep up the escalators leading to the second and third floors. The sea of pink makes me happy I wore my magenta short-sleeved button-down, even if the sweat I emitted on the MTA\u2019s saunalike platform is so bad that it\u2019s gonna rudely manipulate me into finally taking the 100 percent silk shirt to the dry cleaner, a task I\u2019ve managed to dodge since stealing it from my sister. If I hadn\u2019t dressed for the occasion, I would simply look bitter and unpatriotic in the face of everyone else who adhered to the dress code. No one\u2019s really dressing for Oppenheimer, as far as I can tell \u2014 except for the pair of men in blue shirts and briefcases who are running across the place at great speed, late for their screening, I suppose \u2014 but a third of the nearly two dozen people I speak with later are here for both. Maybe my pink is a force field against anyone who\u2019s just seeing Oppenheimer, unclear, but not a soul I speak to tells me they\u2019re here solely for a screening of that film. In the idle din at the moment, I overhear someone ask, \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had fun at the movies?\u201d I can see this is the experience Cruise is probably horny for.\n\nI join the long line of people waiting to get inside the theater until I do a double take after seeing a young couple in matching Barbenheimer T-shirts. One shirt is pink and the other is black, but both share graphics with the movies in question and have Barbenheimer emblazoned in the Barbie font \u2026 or is it the Oppenheimer font? I get their attention. \u201cWe would love to talk, but we\u2019re late for our Barbie showing,\u201d the man says before I can get a good look. Being late is not an option, knowing that moviegoers paid upwards of $40 for the double feature tonight, not including their outfits, popcorn, and a drink.\n\nTaking in the scene, you don\u2019t need to be a nuclear physicist to see that Barbie is winning this theater\u2019s marketing battle and is even doing enough heavy lifting for Oppenheimer to benefit. There\u2019s a massive Barbie ad on the escalator landing. A Barbie step-and-repeat with a matching pink carpet. A life-size Barbie-doll box. Each photo opportunity offers moviegoers the chance to take commemorative pictures with their dates holding pink Barbie Corvettes and dolls purchased at the concession stand (a $64.99 bundle) in one hand and free Barbie posters in the other. Though there\u2019s nothing Oppenheimer-themed save for a poster in the dark first-floor lobby, a few people I chat with think Barbie\u2019s 18-month marketing strategy has had a Reaganomics trickle-down effect on why they\u2019re here for the bomb movie, too. \u201cI am here to see Barbenheimer,\u201d Matt tells me, wearing his ultrahigh platform heels and baby-pink Barbie tank while waiting to take pics in one of the photo ops. Why? \u201cWell, Barbie \u2019cause Barbie\u2019s everything, and Oppenheimer \u2019cause I need to know what the hype\u2019s for.\u201d Willyan Ferreira, for their part, adds that \u201cpink is a very powerful color, and so is an atomic bomb.\u201d A pink-and-blue virus has taken root here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/ 4\n\nChris, wearing a DayGlo Ken outfit, also thinks the Barbenheimer alliance is a joint slay. \u201cI actually see it as a truce,\u201d he says. His partner, Omar, sports yet another baby-pink tank, accessorized with a fuchsia bandanna around his neck. Chris continues, \u201cI think anything that encourages people to go to the movies, like, great, do more double giant releases to get people back.\u201d He\u2019s optimistic about how this model could work in cinema\u2019s favor: \u201cI feel like this is the first time since the pandemic people are really flooding the movie theaters. I was laughing, saying I feel like the staff today is going to be like, \u2018I don\u2019t even remember how to do this!\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter a bit of a dustup with an usher who\u2019s confused about why I bought a ticket for a movie I\u2019m not seeing, I\u2019m standing in the concessions area. Nearly every register is occupied to feed the masses, and the lines snake around the stanchions like a busy airport-security check. A screening of Barbie just let out, and I catch two college students from it sporting unofficial merch. Arnav Das is in a shirt featuring Ryan Gosling\u2019s Ken, and Sofia Cede\u00f1o is wearing a shirt decorated with Margot Robbie\u2019s Barbie; they tell me more merch should include T-shirts of the memes. \u201cHave you seen the picture where it\u2019s like Barbie and Oppenheimer shaking hands and then it\u2019s blowing up in the background?\u201d Cade\u00f1o asks me. I haven\u2019t seen the meme. \u201cThey are, like, facing each other. Yeah, that\u2019s the one I would want.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Zoe Guy\n\nThey leave, and I wait in line with Luna Rahzel, a cosplayer who tells me she purchased two rows \u2014 that\u2019s 22 tickets \u2014 for her and her cohort when tickets first went on sale. We make our way to the front of the line and Rahzel nabs the Corvette popcorn bucket and the Barbie-doll bundle on sale. Luckily, she\u2019s here two hours early to grab some of the clearly dwindling supply. \u201cMattel is making hand over fist on this,\u201d she jokes. \u201cWoo, late-stage capitalism!\u201d\n\nSome still seem to think Barbenheimer shouldn\u2019t have declared a truce. Beth Slade, Hayden Murphy, and Caileigh Potter are \u201cabsolutely not\u201d here for Nolan. \u201cWhat are you going to wear to it? Black?\u201d Potter wonders. \u201cI don\u2019t want to watch people get blown up. The world is dark enough as it is. I want to watch some joy, some pink, something silly, maybe cry a little bit, but in a fun, lighthearted way that\u2019s nostalgic.\u201d Skylar Theis, who will actually see both films, nails it: \u201cShe\u2019s everything; he\u2019s just Oppenheimer.\u201d"

    "text": "Large crowds packing cinemas for Barbie and Oppenheimer could spark another COVID surge, a top virology professor has warned.\n\nDr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine and noted advocate for strong measures against COVID infections, admitted his warning would not be well received.\n\n'Not to be a Debbie Downer\u2026but anyone worried about a post-Barbie Box Office Covid bump? Or post-Oppie?' he asked his 465,000 Twitter followers.\n\n'We'll probably never know since no one seems to be keeping track of such things anymore. Keep up with your boosters and find a pink N-95 or KN-95 if you can.'\n\nDr. Peter Hotez said he knew he was being a 'Debbie Downer,' but warned people to take care if they were packing cinemas to see Barbie or Oppenheimer\n\nBarbie, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, is the biggest film opening so far this year\n\nOppenheimer, starring Cillian Murphy, has also drawn large crowds to movie theatres\n\nBoth films opened this weekend to widespread acclaim and large crowds.\n\nBarbie was the biggest opening of the year, with $162 million at the box office, while Oppenheimer took $82 million.\n\nThe surge in cinema attendance comes as COVID hospitalization rates trended slightly up last week but remained massively below their levels of even a year ago.\n\nIn the week of July 15, a total nationwide of 7,109 people were admitted to the hospital with COVID. By comparison, this week last year saw 45,000 people admitted.\n\nHotez made headlines in June when Democrat long-shot presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a noted anti-vaxxer, challenged the doctor to a debate on Joe Rogan's podcast.\n\nThat led Rogan, too, to challenge Hotez to a debate.\n\nHotez said he would happily appear on Rogan's show, but would not engage in a circus fight with Kennedy.\n\nThe suggestion of a Hotez-Kennedy debate sparked an online frenzy, and saw Hotez challenged at his home by Alex Rosen, a self-proclaimed 'independent journalist' who works for a site called 'Predator Poachers.'\n\nRosen, after exchanging pleasantries, asked Hotez why he wouldn't debate Kennedy.\n\n'Aw come on, that's harassing,' Hotez replied.\n\n'I'm just curious, nothing hostile, just curious,' responded Rosen.\n\nHotez says he's been stalked outside his home, as one right-wing commentator posted a video confronting him\n\nHotez said he hadn't made a decision, saying Rogan 'just invited me, so we'll see. We'll give it some thought.'\n\nAfter repeating he felt Hotez should debate, Rosen asked: 'What do you say to people who think they're vaccine injured?'\n\nHotez, clearly perturbed, began to close his gate and started to walk away from Rosen.\n\n'Ugh I just was stalked in front of my home by a couple of anti-vaxers taunting me to debate RFK Jr,' he tweeted.\n\n'Of course I was looking my Sunday best in our brutal heat wave. What is it with people?'\n\nKennedy in the interview on Rogan's podcast repeated his debunked claims that common childhood vaccines cause autism, which Hotez called 'just awful'.\n\nHotez added: 'It's clear many actually believe this nonsense.'\n\nRogan fired back with a challenge: 'Peter, if you claim what RFK Jr. is saying is 'misinformation' I am offering you $100,000.00 to the charity of your choice if you're willing to debate him on my show with no time limit.'\n\nRogan's interview with Kennedy drew backlash from Hotez who objected to vaccine concerns calling it 'just awful' as he lamented 'it's clear many actually believe this nonsense.'\n\nRFK Jr. appeared on Rogan's podcast, repeating his debunked claims that common childhood vaccines cause autism\n\nIn multiple tweets, Hotez indicated his willingness to appear on Rogan's podcast, which reaches a massive audience of millions on Spotify.\n\n'I'm happy to come on and have a meaningful discussion. I respect you and your show and I don't want an adversarial relationship. I think we can make some progress,' tweeted Hotez.\n\n'And I'm open to a number of different options, but to be pressured to give you an answer on Twitter, now, with a 'take it or leave it' demand that's not how I work. Honestly, I don't even think that would be in your best interests,' he wrote.\n\nKennedy also indicated his willingness to engage, tweeting: 'Peter. Let's finally have the respectful, congenial, informative debate that the American people deserve.'"

    "text": "The Barbenheimer phenomenon is almost certainly the most obnoxiously contrived and contrivedly obnoxious show business event since the day Danny Snyder pretended to put his wife in charge of the Washington Commanders. Everyone connected with this cynical combo plate, from filmmakers through actors, reviewers through moviegoers, deserve all the eye, skin, and social diseases one can get from trying to cut in on the latest trend in cultural death. Maybe that's just because your author seems to have other things to do when every movie in the world plays.\n\nBut because of an editor who will remain nameless even though it is that bastard Petchesky, Barbenheimer in the theater it had to be, upon which two things became clear.\n\nIf you watched Barbie before Oppenheimer as your victimized typist did, you got the order wrong. Barbie is simply a spoiler alert for our post-apocalyptic future, and in that context Oppenheimer merely becomes the turgid tale of a self-absorbed and smug power nerd who didn't make enough bombs to avert the future that included Barbie. Everybody with an opinion about this hype-powered combo-dirigible has already given it, and the verdict is in\u2014they're both movies. Taken individually, they have that certain indefinable je ne sais blah, but rammed together they are famous for simply making no thematic sense as a pairing, forcing otherwise borderline decent people to compare blancmange and concrete because some death-warrants-with-marketing-degrees decreed it shall be an \"event.\" The wolverines who lunched up this twin monstrosity bought time, space, and bandwidth anywhere that accepted free content or ad money, found that news organizations are desperate to avoid all forms of work, and therefore hook/line/sinkered the whole mess, just to show their bosses they could.\n\nBarbie was, of course, all about the marketing, and in our theater (name withheld to keep the lawyers caged), the number of elderly folks dressed like Barbie and Ken reminded us yet again to see the good side of the planet being baked into oblivion by global warming. Even the restaurant adjacent to our local theater made its workers dress as Barbie characters (not hard, as most of the characters are either Barbie or Ken, and nobody is dressing up like Rhea Perlman) and offered up menu choices like Barbie Malibu (coconut rum infused with bubble gum extract, for the professional diabetic in your life) and Radioactive Deviled Eggs (probably an Oppenheimer reference but one can\u2019t be certain).\n\nThe warmup act for Barbie was a couple of preteen girls either employed or dragooned to play a song (electric ukulele, to give you an idea) in a burst of reimagined vaudeville that can best be explained by the deathless phrase, \"This is a song we wrote last week, and I think it's the best song we've ever done.\" That seems a safe enough bet, and the polite army of Barbie impersonators in the audience applauded their courage.\n\nThe fact that nobody dressed up as Robert Oppenheimer at Movie Night, or really at any time since 1962, isn't the point. It's that cinematic polar opposites were shotgun-married to fake a weekend outing at the services of the Mattel Corporation and the wheezing movie industry.\n\nIt was a good weekend for box offices, (an estimated $155M for Barbs, $80M for Oppy), but how about the films? Your misshapen stenographer is not a movie critic and would rather become a narcotics informer than begin now, but you're paying for halfwit opinions, so here's another: Meh. Barbie plays out as if it were imagined by Joseph Stalin, Sofia Vergara, Brian Wilson, and a closet of crank-fueled HGTV showrunners, while Oppenheimer plays out as Stalin's breakout solo project. Either way, the villains (Lewis Strauss v. Ryan Gosling-Ken) are the same guy, and the heroes (Ruth Handler vs. Kitty Oppenheimer) aren't on long enough. And like most movies, the universal takeaway here is that the old adage, \"Always leave them wanting less,\" wins again. In this case the \"less\" in question is about 25 minutes of each, or the time of the average moviehouse nap, which your author successfully executed right about the time Matt Damon shows up as Sympathetic Careerist Colonel Pain In The Ass. No plot points were missed.\n\nBarbie decidedly began as more fun, Oppenheimer profoundly more dismal, and while after a clever run-up (hey, it's Helen Mirren!) Barbie got grimmer as the plot dumbed itself down for the required 10th-grade-level back-end movie lecture, Oppenheimer's lead in soul-crushing moroseness was too much to overcome. Then again, Oppenheimer was supposed to be Lars von Trier\u2013level bleak, so in that way I guess it wins this match that should never have been made.\n\nThat's the real takeaway from the two films if, like us, you prefer people make their own judgments about their entertainment and then do the rest of the party the great courtesy of keeping their opinions to themselves. Both movies in their mashup form, after four Empress and tonics, two Angry Orchard ciders, and five or eight glasses of wine, seem to be treatises on America's polarities of institutionalized despair. No, your perturbed reviewer did not order all those himself. This is important for you to know because (a) no single person could drink that much and not breathalyze a night in the can, and (b) to let the kids in Defector Accounting know that they are on the hook for three dinners, six tickets, and all the alcohol. Yep, you sent us to the movies and we made it cost about three bills. Next time, you'll think a little harder about both the financial and psychic cost of such assignments. We could sit through Oppenheimer one more time at home if only to see what we missed during the nap, but Barbie is a one-off, as it was meant to be.\n\nIn other words, this entire mudslide of a weekend is now over and never to be referenced again. Even if the studios want to try this gambit again (imagine remakes of La La Land and The Killing Fields played for a film class at Northwestern with students powered by four hours' sleep and three gallons of Fireball), it will be hard to imagine us lurching at this particular hook ever again. After all, once is slightly forced weirdness, but twice is a week's worth of ESPN programming streamed on a perpetual loop, and absolutely nobody needs that. Plus, we intend to beat up the nameless editor who is still that worm Petchesky and abandon him in the New Hampshire woods. Now there's the happy ending we're all looking for."

    "text": "\u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d the simultaneous July 21 release of Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cBarbie\u201d and Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d turned a meme into the most widely anticipated cinematic event of the year. The films\u2019 contrasting aesthetics have been fodder for jokes, photo edits and themed outfits. Fans have been delighting in their favorite filmmakers going head-to-head, pitting pitch black against bubblegum pink.\n\nThe whole thing is funny, if you are able to differentiate the film \u201cOppenheimer\u201d from its real world inspiration, but that line has definitely blurred. When a \u201cBarbie house\u201d appeared in Malibu as a promotion for the film, the internet was quick to joke that the Oppenheimer team would nuke it for their own marketing campaign.\n\nBarbie and Oppenheimer are both trying to stop the destruction of their own worlds.\n\nThe films\u2019 apparent incongruity created a farcical pairing that busted the box office. Tens of thousands of people bought same-day tickets for both \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and \u201cBarbie,\u201d watching them as a double feature. In their first weekend, \u201cOppenheimer\u201d grossed $82.4 million and \u201cBarbie\u201d a whopping $155 million at the domestic box office\u2014becoming the biggest-ever opening box office for a film directed by a woman. What fans who saw both didn\u2019t expect was how well the apparent opposites thematically complement each other.\n\nFor all their differences, Barbenheimer has some genuine thematic throughlines. Lynda Carter, the actress most famous for her portrayal of a super-Barbie role in the 1970s Wonder Woman show, brilliantly observed that \u201cBarbie lives in the world Oppenheimer made.\u201d That is undeniably true. Barbie was first created in the late 1950s, the most nuclear-haunted time of world history, which was also the pinnacle of the post-war consumer boom. \u201cBarbie\u201d may have been a reaction to the post-war restoration of traditional gender roles, when the G.I. Kens came back from the war and Rosie the Riveters were kicked out of the shipyards and sent back to the kitchens.\n\nPerhaps the most striking example was the ending of the free child care programs the federal government had created to accommodate so many mothers going to build planes, tanks and ships. It was an intentional move to get women back into the home. This is almost exactly what occurs in \u201cBarbie,\u201d when Ken returns from the \u201creal world\u201d enamored of patriarchy and ready to introduce traditional gender roles in the Barbieland utopia.\n\nThe actress Lynda Carter brilliantly observed that \u201cBarbie lives in the world Oppenheimer made.\u201d\n\nBoth films dig into titular characters uncomfortable with their own legacies. This may seem an odd comparison. After all, J. Robert Oppenheimer created the atomic bomb, and Barbie is a plastic doll. But both created (and are creations of) their particular moments of American history\u2014moments whose legacies we are still dealing with today.\n\nBarbie takes her legacy very seriously. In the film, all the Barbies in Barbieland think they have solved all the world\u2019s problems for women, but as soon as she enters the real world, a girl accuses Barbie of fascism, stating she makes women feel bad about themselves and displays unrealistic beauty standards. Barbie weeps at this criticism. In a speech intended to celebrate the bomb\u2019s use, Oppenheimer envisions the bomb\u2019s destruction in an incinerated skeleton and a woman with flaking skin. Neither Oppenheimer nor Barbie really understands that they\u2019ve done anything wrong until they confront the effects of their actions. They are both haunted by unintended consequences and wrestle with the fact that many people do not like or approve of them.\n\nTaken together, Barbenheimer is a scathing indictment of life in a man\u2019s world.\n\nNeither character directly apologizes or asks for forgiveness, and neither can truly dismantle the damage they have done. Yet they both try to distance themselves from their pasts. Oppenheimer, in real life and in the film, continues to work in nuclear science but becomes opposed to further nuclear proliferation and the brewing arms race with the Soviets. Meanwhile, Barbie works to let go of the perfectionism that plagues her and her legacy. They are both seeking penance, but neither truly believes they are deserving of forgiveness. Barbie\u2019s fears are met with kindness: Gloria, the woman who brought Barbie to the real world, reassures her: \u201cYou are so beautiful and so smart, and it kills me that you don\u2019t think you\u2019re good enough.\u201d Oppenheimer\u2019s wife confirms his fears: \u201cYou think because you let them tar and feather you that the world will forgive you? They won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nTaken together, Barbenheimer is a scathing indictment of life in a man\u2019s world. Barbie is overt in its criticism of the patriarchy, even if delivering it within a satire. The male-dominated \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is a little more subtextual. No women are in the rooms where it is decided to drop the bombs that kill between 129,000 and 226,000 people. U.S. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson jokes he doesn\u2019t want to drop the bomb on Kyoto because he honeymooned there. Nolan uses this moment to underline how out of touch these powerful men are with the reality of what they are doing. Oppenheimer says he lost his faith in the project when he realized that anything he built would be used against our enemies in war. Barbie and Oppenheimer did not choose how the world reacted to them, but there were real-world consequences whether intended or not.\n\nBarbie and Oppenheimer also both deal with existential dread. They question the meaning of death and wrestle with the sanctity of life. Oppenheimer is utilitarian in his thinking about the bomb until it is used. He justifies its creation by saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know if we can be trusted with such a weapon. But I know the Nazis can\u2019t.\u201d But by the time the bomb is built, the Nazis had already been defeated. And though the bombs may have hastened the end of the war, he cannot help feeling he has blood on his hands. Barbie feels the sanctity of her own life as she steps into what it means to be human, mortal and imperfect. These two people didn\u2019t mean to be more than they are. He just wanted to be a physicist, and she just wants to be a woman.\n\nBarbie and Oppenheimer are both trying to stop the destruction of their own worlds. Oppenheimer seems resigned to the fact that the damage is done and nuclear war is inevitable. Barbie is hopeful that things can and will change for the better. They make a much more thought-provoking pairing than a mere internet meme could convey. The juxtaposition of masculine and feminine, destruction and creation, dread and hope, may leave moviegoers thinking a little harder about their own place in the world."

    "text": "As our team scoped the timepieces of everyone involved in the films and promotional tours, Tag Heuer and Hamilton were the clear winners: they were almost the only watch brands present in Barbie and Oppenheimer, respectively.\n\nThe much-anticipated simultaneous release of blockbuster films Barbie and Oppenheimer on July 21 finally brought the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d movement to a crescendo. The tongue-in-cheek portmanteau refers to the entertaining duality between the bubblegum celebration of Mattel\u2019s iconic doll and the grim ethical and historical overtones from the story of the father of the atomic bomb.\n\nWhile perhaps not quite a thematic Barbenheimer equivalent in the watch world, it\u2019s still interesting to see references from both watch houses appearing on the silver screen and red carpet, thanks to the brands\u2019 partnerships with the films\u2019 cast members.\n\nSpoilers ahead as we check out the timepieces from Barbie and Oppenheimer!\n\nTag Heuer x Barbie\n\nRyan Gosling leads a show-stopping musical number in Barbie. Photo: Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nIt should be far from surprising that Ryan Gosling\u2019s ambassadorship with Tag Heuer made its way into the movie as Beach Ken wrestled with the gender role reversal he experienced in reality vs Barbieland.\n\nKen bringing patriarchy \u2013 and plenty of horses \u2013 to Barbieland was a sour note in the second act of the film, but it did give us Gosling in a fur coat along with several pairs of shades and no less than three different vintage Heuer Carrera chronographs on his wrists at the same time, as reported by Hodinkee.\n\nTwo of the three Heuer Carreras that Ryan Gosling\u2019s Ken wore in Barbie. Photos: Handout\n\nThe pieces themselves are from the 1960s and 70s, from before Heuer was bought by the Tag racing company and a few years after the original Ken was introduced in 1961. However, we surmise that the watches were chosen not so much for their horological significance (all three are seminal pieces in Heuer\u2019s history of chronographs) but for the sheer golden decadence the pieces exude.\n\nRyan Gosling at Canadian promotions for Barbie, sporting a pink Tag Heuer Carrera Date 36mm. Photo: Getty Images\n\nTo cap it all off, Gosling sported a more modern, pink Tag Heuer Carrera Date 36mm in Toronto for the Canadian leg of promotions, in contrast with his pastel blue and pink suit, per media reports.\n\nHamilton x Oppenheimer\n\nOppenheimer was written and directed by Christopher Nolan. Photo: Universal Pictures\n\nThe temptation to label Tag Heuer x Hamilton the Barbenheimer of watches this summer is strong, but even though both films tapped long-standing partnerships to source three vintage references from the respective brands for the screen, the similarities end there.\n\nHamilton vintage pieces worn by Cillian Murphy in Oppenheimer, from left to right: Cushion B, Lexington and Endicott. Photo: Hamilton\n\nSeasoned director Christopher Nolan tapped his long-standing relationship with Hamilton to source vintage pieces for the biopic on J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb played by Cillian Murphy.\n\nThe film comprises interwoven scenes from Oppenheimer\u2019s early life and career, his work with the Manhattan Project in the 1940s developing the atomic bomb, and subsequent security hearings in the 1950s with Congress and the United States Atomic Energy Commission regarding suspected Communist leanings and his clearance to work on atomic weapons.\n\nMatt Damon wore Hamilton pieces as lieutenant general Leslie Jones in Oppenheimer: left, the Military Ordonance and right, the Piping Rock. Photo: Hamilton\n\nMurphy sported the period-appropriate Cushion B two-handed 1930s piece alongside the black-dialled Lexington and golden Endicott, both with sub-seconds dials and from the 1940s, the brand confirmed.\n\nEmily Blunt , who plays Kitty Oppenheimer, sports the discreet Lady Hamilton A-2 in a square case with gold-coloured indices and hands; while Matt Damon, as lieutenant general Leslie Groves, wears the Piping Rock and Military Ordonance \u2013 both quintessential pieces for military men during the period.\n\nHamilton Khaki Field \u201cMurph\u201d 38mm, inspired by the unique version of the Khaki Field Auto from Christopher Nolan\u2019s 2014 film Interstellar. Photo: Hamilton\n\nNolan\u2019s relationship with Hamilton is well-known \u2013 as is his tendency to play with the concept of time in his films. Hamilton provided a version of the Khaki Navy BelowZero for his 2020 feature Tenet.\n\nBut his most famous collaboration with the brand was its unique design for the Hamilton Khaki Field. The subsequent significance of the watch to the plot of his 2014 hit Interstellar resulted in the release of the Hamilton Khaki Field Murph 42mm in 2019, per the brand. The latter most recently received a refresh in 38mm in 2022."

    "text": "This summer\u2019s biggest movie releases brought us \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d a real-life thriller about a weapon that could save and possibly destroy humanity, and \u201cBarbie,\u201d a musical comedy about a doll that thinks she\u2019s solved but actually set back equal rights.\n\nWhile some people have turned the movies into a double-feature, my version of Barbenheimer pairs \u201cBarbie\u201d with \u201cMild Vertigo,\u201d a newly translated Japanese novel. I haven\u2019t come up with a cute mashup name for these two works that dig into the paradoxes of being a woman. (No spoilers ahead for either film or the book.)\n\n\u201cMild Vertigo\u201d is narrated by Natsumi, a stay-at-home mom tending to her apartment in Tokyo. We hear voices of neighbors gossiping over the minute differences in the neighborhoods\u2019 apartments A-F. We hear the chatter of birds outside the windows and from Natsumi\u2019s past. And we hear her thoughts, a running commentary of the minutiae in her boring life. What to buy. How to clean. Her days are nothing and everything.\n\nHer stream of consciousness with sentences stretching several pages reminds me of modernist writers like Gertrude Stein from a century ago. Mieko Kanai wrote \u201cMild Vertigo\u201d in 1997. The English translation was released this spring, leaving me wondering what\u2019s really changed \u2014 not stylistically, but the subtext.\n\nAs I write this, I heard the chime of Beepy, the robot vacuum, and paused to empty it and saw the swim bag next to the trashcan and made sure it has my daughter\u2019s swimsuit, the one with long sleeves to protect her from the sun, and water shoes and sunscreen for today\u2019s swim class. (Will it be canceled because there\u2019s a 60% chance of rain? How will the teacher reach out about a cancellation? We\u2019ve emailed but does she check her email often? Can she check it when she spends her day in the pool?) Should I roast some vegetables now when nobody\u2019s in the hot kitchen and was this vacuum a stupid splurge even if it was a Prime Day deal and that review site said it was good and it has cleaned more than any adult has in a while and why do people care about how clean a floor is? Do I care about the people who do care?\n\nNatsumi\u2019s banal narrative exposes what\u2019s beneath the performance of life, maintaining appearances.\n\nIn \u201cBarbie,\u201d the Barbies rule and run Barbieland. They can do anything so they do everything. Their days may not be filled with keeping house and caregiving but they\u2019re still Sisyphean.\n\n\u201cThis is the best day ever. So was yesterday and so is tomorrow and every day from now until forever,\u201d says stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) during a fabulously sparkly choreographed dance.\n\nHer day is just like how kids play. No water in the shower or milk in the carton. No need to walk down the stairs when you can float down to the ground for a fun day at the beach. Her days are nothing and everything. When things start to change, Barbie wants nothing more than a normal day that ends, as every day ends, with a girls night.\n\nKenergy aside, a pivotal moment in \u201cBarbie\u201d is the monologue of Gloria (America Ferrera) about the ridiculousness of the double standards woman juggle. The original monologue was written by director Greta Gerwig with notes from Ferrera and took almost 30 takes to capture.\n\nIt\u2019s a message that has brought viewers to tears and in the film, inspired stereotypical Barbie out of her hopelessness into action.\n\n\u201cBy giving voice to the cognitive dissonance required to be a woman under the patriarchy, you robbed it of its power,\u201d Barbie says.\n\nThese two works give a voice to what\u2019s unsaid: the unrealistic expectations, the mental labor of caregiving, the adjustments under the gaze. Perhaps they\u2019re real-life thrillers about something that could save humanity."

The central bank took a pause in June after 10 straight rate hikes, but another increase has already been baked in by most economists. The bigger question though is whether the Fed will raise rates again at its next meeting in September in order to get them over with as soon as possible.

    "text": "There are two new wide or semi-wide releases this weekend, \u201cThe Last Voyage of the Demeter\u201d and \u201cJules,\u201d but how many moviegoers will actually buy tickets with so many other stronger contenders still in theaters? Read on for Gold Derby\u2019s box office preview.\n\nBefore we get to the new movies this week, we probably should address the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d in the room. There\u2019s very little doubt that \u201cBarbie\u201d can pull off a rare fourth weekend at #1 with upwards of $32 million or more after holding up so well against \u201cMeg 2\u201d and the \u201cNinja Turtles\u201d this past weekend. Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer\u201d also has a good chance at reclaiming second place, since it\u2019s likely to have a smaller drop-off this weekend than both of last week\u2019s new movies.\n\nSEE Box office: \u2018Barbie\u2019 crosses $400 million mark in less than 3 weeks\n\n\u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\u201d was just two million behind \u201cMeg 2: The Trench\u201d over the weekend but received much better reviews and a higher CinemaScore, so we can probably expect it to hold up better and take third place, leaving fourth place for \u201cMeg 2.\u201d\n\nThat brings us to the first of the new wide releases, and that is Universal Pictures\u2019 \u201cThe Last Voyage of the Demeter,\u201d directed by Andr\u00e9 \u00d8vredal (\u201cScary Stories to Tell in the Dark\u201d). It\u2019s based on the section of Bram Stoker\u2019s \u201cDracula\u201d where the vampire travels by ship from Romania to England to continue his reign of terror. In this case, Dracula (or \u201cNosferatu,\u201d going by the 1922 silent classic starring Max Schreck) is played by creature performer and actor Javier Botet.\n\nThe crew of the Demeter \u2013 that\u2019s the name of the ship \u2013 includes Corey Hawkins from \u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d as a British doctor hoping to get a trip back home, while the captain is played by veteran actor Liam Cunningham (\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d) and his young son is played by Woody Norman (\u201cC\u2019mon C\u2019mon\u201d). Other known names and/or faces include David Dastmalchian (\u201cAnt-Man,\u201d \u201cThe Boogeyman\u201d) as the ship\u2019s first mate and Irish-Italian actress Aisling Franciosi (also \u201cGoT\u201d) as a stowaway.\n\nWhile the movie definitely has the Dracula thing going for it and being dark horror by a fairly well-respected genre filmmaker like \u00d8vredal, it\u2019s also a period gothic horror film, which tend to be a tougher sell to American audiences. Case in point: 2012\u2019s \u201cThe Woman in Black,\u201d starring Daniel Radcliffe, opened shortly after the end of his \u201cHarry Potter\u201d run with $20.9 million in early February; its 2015 sequel sans Radcliffe earned roughly half the original film\u2019s domestic take. The 2018 gothic horror film \u201cWinchester\u201d (also from the now defunct CBS Films) opened on the same weekend as \u201cWoman in Black\u201d with just $9.3 million and grossed less than $46 million worldwide.\n\nSEE Grab the popcorn and sound off in our movie forums\n\nEarlier this year, the Dracula horror-comedy spin-off \u201cRenfield,\u201d starring Nicholas Hoult and Nicolas Cage as Dracula, bombed quite badly, opening with just $8 million, so it\u2019s odd for Universal to be releasing another Dracula spin-off (essentially) so soon.\n\nThere\u2019s a good chance that a movie like \u201cDemeter\u201d can do well in European and other international countries, but Universal is only opening the movie in roughly 2,600 North American theaters, maybe realizing it would be a tougher sell. Reviews (which won\u2019t hit until Thursday) probably won\u2019t be so kind for various reasons I won\u2019t break embargo to share, but those things alone might keep \u201cThe Last Voyage of the Demeter\u201d from opening over $10 million. Because of that, it\u2019s likely to open in fifth place behind last week\u2019s rejiggered top four.\n\nFilmmaker Marc Turtletaub, who received an Oscar nomination for producing \u201cLittle Miss Sunshine,\u201d directs \u201cJules,\u201d a smaller indie comedy starring Sir Ben Kingsley as a small-town Pennsylvania resident who encounters an alien after his craft crash lands in his garden. Bleecker Street Films will be releasing the movie moderately wide on Friday, also in an attempt to try to grab older adult business away from \u201cOppenheimer\u201d mostly.\n\nSEE 2023 box office hits: Every movie that made more than $100 million\n\nTurtletaub previously directed the Sundance drama \u201cPuzzle,\u201d starring Kelly McDonald and late Bollywood great Irrfan Khan, but that movie didn\u2019t even make $2.3 million worldwide, which is not a good sign that the producer of so many huge hits picks the best material to direct. (Turtletaub previously wrote \u201cGods Behaving Badly\u201d and two short films, but he didn\u2019t write either of his most recent features.)\n\nAlthough Kingsley probably has a decent draw with older audiences, as does his co-star, Jane Curtin, a veteran from the early days of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d there\u2019s no theater count reported for \u201cJules,\u201d as of this writing. Without having a presence in more than 1,000 theaters, there\u2019s no guarantee this can even get into the Top 10, making something closer to the $2 million opening for the Bleecker Street release \u201cMafia Mamma\u201d earlier this year, but probably less.\n\nAlso, Cohen Media Group will give a platform release to Juliet Binoche\u2019s latest film \u201cBetween Two Worlds,\u201d directed by Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re. Check back on Sunday to see if the new movies fare better against the late summer blockbusters.\n\nSIGN UP for Gold Derby\u2019s free newsletter with latest predictions"

    "text": "The AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. shareholder seeking to derail the settlement over its APE units renewed her bid to halt any stock conversion for an appeal if the deal is approved.\n\nThe success of blockbusters \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and the theater chain\u2019s own actions belie the idea that it will be ruined by any delay in converting the preferred units to common stock, according to court papers filed Tuesday and late Monday by Rose Izzo, the retail investor leading the charge against the settlement.\n\nAMC\u2019s \u201coverhyped concerns and unreasonable demands ring hollow,\u201d according to the filing in Delaware\u2019s Chancery Court. \u201cIf defendants believe their own math, then waiting three weeks to correct a problem raised at the settlement hearing cost AMC approximately $25 million. They should welcome some preemptive action.\u201d\n\nIn pushing to delay any conversion of the AMC Preferred Equity units, or APEs, Izzo is seeking to capitalize on Vice Chancellor Morgan T. Zurn\u2019s ruling rejecting the original version of the settlement, which stunned analysts July 21, scrambling the trading positions of arbitragers betting on the conversion. The decision sent AMC common stock surging and the preferred units plunging.\n\nHollywood Strikes, \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019\n\nIzzo is one of the nearly 3,000 retail investors\u2014many of them participants in the \u201cmeme stock\u201d rally that saved the company from a pandemic-era bankruptcy\u2014who wrote to the court to oppose the settlement. The deal, announced in April, has fluctuated in value within the $110 million to $120 million range, depending on AMC\u2019s stock price.\n\nShe\u2019s the only one who showed up at a June court hearing with an attorney to formally object. Her lawyer, Ted Kittila, has said he\u2019s ready to take over the case, scuttle the agreement, and resume the court fight on behalf of investors who feel \u201cstabbed in the back\u201d by the company and the shareholders that negotiated the deal.\n\nZurn\u2019s surprise ruling rejecting the settlement was a relatively narrow one. She turned the deal down over provisions\u2014which she had flagged at the hearing three weeks earlier\u2014that waived any claims by common stockholders, including those involving APEs they might also hold. State corporate laws require such releases to work on a share-by-share rather than investor-by-investor basis, the judge said.\n\nAMC and the lead shareholders swiftly filed a revised settlement aimed at addressing those concerns, and Zurn agreed within days to resume weighing the agreement without offering investors a new opportunity to object. Both sides stressed in court papers the importance of a ruling in the first half of August, \u201cbefore the capital markets go quiet\u201d until after Labor Day.\n\nThe company\u2019s filing described Hollywood\u2019s ongoing labor strikes as a \u201cserious threat,\u201d echoing a July 23 open letter from CEO Adam Aron stating that AMC\u2019s \u201crisk of financial collapse is not whimsical.\u201d The theater chain has since been buoyed by the simultaneous blockbusters.\n\nPlaying Coy\n\nIzzo, meanwhile, has sought to ensure that her channels of appeal remain open if Zurn signs off on the revised settlement. Letting the APE conversion go through while the state\u2019s top court is considering the case would \u201cfrustrate appellate review,\u201d according to her court filing Tuesday.\n\n\u201cClawing back the settlement consideration following a successful appeal may be impossible,\u201d Izzo said. She also pointed to the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d revenues AMC is now enjoying. \u201cThe parties play coy as to why disaster is closer now,\u201d following \u201cunrelenting positive news,\u201d the filing said.\n\nAlso Tuesday, another shareholder leading a separate lawsuit against AMC\u2014one that would force the company to hold its first annual meeting and board election since June 2022\u2014accused the company of stalling on an expedited hearing date. \u201cThis matter can and should be set for a hearing in August,\u201d he said.\n\nIzzo is represented by is represented by Halloran Farkas & Kittila LLP. AMC is represented by Richards, Layton & Finger PA and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP. Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann LLP, Grant & Eisenhofer PA, Fields Kupka & Shukurov LLP, and Saxena White PA are counsel for the pension fund and investor leading the litigation.\n\nThe cases are In re AMC Ent. Holdings Inc. S\u2019holder Litig., Del. Ch., No. 2023-0215, 8/1/23 and Barnes v. AMC Ent. Holdings Inc., Del. Ch., No. 2023-0718, 8/1/23."

    "text": "After three weekends in theaters, Greta Gerwig\u2019s \"Barbie\" surpassed the $1 billion mark in global ticket sales. Gerwig became the highest grossing female director of all time, breaking a record previously held by Patty Jenkins, director of \"Wonder Woman.\"\n\nThe highly anticipated paranoia thriller, \"Oppenheimer\" was directed by Christopher Nolan and released the same weekend as \"Barbie.\" The two films collectively generated $244.5 million in North American ticket sales their opening weekend in theaters. \u201cBarbie\u201d brought in $162 million, followed by \u201cOppenheimer\u201d at $82.5 million.\n\nThe Margot Robbie-led and produced film has been comfortably seated in first place since the film's release on July 21.\n\nMovie ticket sales are crawling back to pre-pandemic levels\n\nAccording to The Numbers, a publicly available database of movie industry statistics, annual tickets sold for 2023 are expected to reach 922 million. That's compared to 2022, where total tickets sold reached 709 million. While 2023 ticket sales are not expected to surpass 2019\u2019s pre-pandemic levels of 1.2 billion, they\u2019re inching closer, partially in service to the global sensation that is \"Barbenheimer.\"\n\nShawn Robbins, chief analyst at Box Office Pro, said \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" drove a huge social conversation that went above and beyond the internet. The meme of \"Barbenheimer\" caught wildfire, Robbins said. \u201cEverybody heard about it, and everybody outside of movie circles has been talking about it for the last few weeks.\u201d The cultural phenomenon drove non-moviegoers to the theaters, breaking significant box-office records.\n\nTheater-etiquette:Bad behavior in blockbusters sparks discussion\n\nThe 'Barbenheimer\u2019 phenomenon:How a movie meme inspired the 'crazy, weird' double feature\n\n'Barbie' smashes box office records\n\nWhile \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\u201d is currently the highest-grossing movie of 2023 sitting at $1.35 billion, \u201cBarbie\u201d is projected to beat that record. \u201cBarbie\u201d not only had the biggest opening weekend of 2023, but it was also the biggest opening weekend for any movie directed by a woman.\n\nDomestic box-office sales for \"Barbie\" and \u201cOppenheimer,\" combined were the fourth largest of all time for an opening weekend. The only bigger opening movie weekends were for \u201cAvengers,\" \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" or \u201cStar Wars\u201d films.\n\n\"Barbie\" had the biggest opening week in history of any Warner Bros. film, raking in more than half a billion dollars.\n\n\u201cBarbie stands out as one of the very few female-centric, female-targeted blockbusters of the summer,\u201d said Robbins. \"The movie offered something fresh in a summer that\u2019s been jam-packed with franchise sequels.\"\n\nYoung people are driving a movie-theater comeback\n\nWhile movie ticket sales and box office numbers are not back to pre-pandemic levels, industry data shows that young people are behind the growing market of moviegoers. About 80% of the \"Barbie\" audience was younger than 35. And 65% of the audience was female, according to data from Box Office Pro.\n\n\u201cThe audience driving this rebound has been young.\u201d Robbins said. He pointed to \u201cSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\u201d as an example of a film playing well to a younger audience.\n\nThe year-to-date domestic box office recently crossed the $6 billion mark. The last time this mark was hit in summer was in early July 2019, according to data shared by Robbins.\n\nBut keep in mind, with screenwriters and actors on strike, the movie industry is destined to feel the impact of delayed and or canceled production."

    "text": "Barbie, the doll, may be 64 years old, but \u201cBarbie,\u201d the movie, is a pandemic baby.\n\nGreta Gerwig, the Oscar-nominated filmmaker behind \u201cLittle Women\u201d and \u201cLady Bird,\u201d started dreaming it up at a time when she wasn\u2019t sure movies would ever come back.\n\n\u201cI wanted to channel something that had that ache in it, but also something so wild and unruly and something that was so just spilling out over the edges of it that you want to be in a group and see it big,\u201d Gerwig told The Associated Press this week. \u201cBecause I thought we\u2019ll never make any movies again, but if they\u2019re going to, I\u2019d like this.\u201d\n\nHer \u201cBarbie,\u201d which releases in theaters on Friday, is a joyful, maximalist, deeply weird, insightful and defiantly pink confection starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. She co-wrote it with her partner, Noah Baumbach, with whom she shares two sons \u2014 a toddler and a five-month-old whom they welcomed into the world while getting \u201cBarbie\u201d out to the world.\n\nGerwig spoke to the AP this week about the film, the reviews, the tension between art and commerce, and the unlikely connection between \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d (Hint: It\u2019s not just the release date.)\n\nRemarks have been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.AP: Reviews for \u201cBarbie\u201d came out (Wednesday) and are very positive. I\u2019m wondering if you engage with those and how you\u2019re feeling?\n\nGERWIG: I do. I mean, of course. I\u2019m not Emily Dickinson. I\u2019m not above anything. I didn\u2019t actually look last night because I just knew I would be too anxious. I was like go to sleep, wake up, caffeinate, get your kid to summer camp and then find out where we are. There\u2019s a lot of reviewers that I really respect and have really liked. Film criticism matters to me as a person and also being in conversation with people who think about cinema matters. But it can feel very scary at the moment that you\u2019re at the emotional pitch of releasing a movie to take it in.\n\nWhat I tend to do is know which ones I\u2019m going to go back to in a few weeks when I can take it in more. It\u2019s too overwhelming at the moment. \u2026 All my metaphors go to giving birth because I have a five-month-old but it would be like if you just give birth and then you\u2019re like, \u201cWhat are the reviews of the baby?\u201d But I did check the email and I\u2019m pleased. (\u201cBarbie\u201d) seems to have been received in the spirit that it was meant, which is exciting.AP: I read that you called Peter Weir (\u201cThe Truman Show\u201d director) to get advice on creating an artificial world with emotional authenticity. Is there anything he told you that you can share?\n\nGERWIG: He was so generous getting on the phone with me. I had this idea of making Barbie Land basically an interior soundstage world. That was that was the concept. But as big as soundstages are, they\u2019re not the world. They\u2019re going to be small. You can only hang the lights so high.\n\nThere\u2019s obviously parts of his movie that are done on a stage, but then there are other parts of it that can\u2019t possibly be on a stage because it\u2019s too big, but it feels like it\u2019s on a stage, you know? Why does it feel like it\u2019s on a stage? He explained to me they did shoot a lot of it outside in this community in Florida, but that they hung big stage lighting everywhere so it would look lit even though it was outside. And then he said it made everything like 120 degrees and that he did not suggest that. He was like I wouldn\u2019t do that. It works but you might want to avoid making a place that\u2019s hot, hotter.AP: That\u2019s great that you asked.\n\nGERWIG: In my experience, directors are so generous speaking about what they\u2019ve done and how they did it and what were the problems, because you\u2019re only ever on your own movie AND movies are hard and they always feel completely unlikely and completely impossible but in a new way that the other one wasn\u2019t. Whatever lessons you learned on the last one, you can apply some of them, but it\u2019s going to be a new set of issues. And other directors want to give you the knowledge that they\u2019ve gotten that they can\u2019t use anymore because they\u2019ve already made that movie.\n\nI had the same experience when I was making \u201cLittle Women.\u201d Steven Spielberg was incredibly generous with me because he had made \u201cLincoln,\u201d which took place in the same year. He opened up all of his research, all the lighting diagrams that he did with his cinematographer. He was like here\u2019s how we did it. He just showed me absolutely everything. Even though you\u2019re only ever in your own in your own dream of your own movie, there\u2019s camaraderie in the loneliness.AP: I wondered going in if \u201cBarbie\u201d was going to be for kids, but then about 15 minutes in I realized that this is exactly the type of movie that I wish I\u2019d had to obsess over at age 8 instead of, like \u201cGrease 2.\u201d\n\nGERWIG: I\u2019ve never thought of such a sharp delineation of like what\u2019s for kids and for adults. I just don\u2019t see it as church and state. There\u2019s this Demetri Martin joke that\u2019s like, saying you like kids is like saying, \u201cI like people, for a little while.\u201d We all have some sense of childhood and sense of moving out of it, too, which I think is something that I probably will be forever interested in. We\u2019re not Merlin. We only live in one direction.AP: There\u2019s talk of a Proust Barbie in the film, which doesn\u2019t seem random. Could you elaborate on why you chose him?\n\nGERWIG: In \u201cRemembrance of Things Past,\u201d in \u201cSwann\u2019s Way,\u201d he is literally thrown back into his childhood through the taste of the madeleine. I thought, well, that\u2019ll be a nice Easter egg for one person.AP: Proust was Oppenheimer\u2019s favorite too. I did not expect that to be the connection between these movies.\n\nGERWIG: So he would have loved Proust Barbie!AP: There\u2019s a scene where Barbie enters the real world and is being ogled on Venice Beach and certainly it\u2019s something a lot of women can relate to, but I wonder if that reminded you at all of your days starting out as an actor and feeling like you had to look a certain way.\n\nGERWIG: I always felt like I was just was never quite right, that I was somehow being looked at and found lacking. That\u2019s not exclusively available for actors, I think it\u2019s pretty universal. But it\u2019s heightened as an actor. I did an audition once and I was wearing overalls, I think it was for a TV show, and I got into the room and the casting director looked at me and said \u201cWell you must be very talented.\u201d I thought, \u201cOh no, maybe I\u2019m not talented enough to just be wearing overalls.\u201d Also that this is going quite badly.AP: There\u2019s some thematic similarities between all your films \u2014 women\u2019s economic independence, self-actualization and the idea that emotion is not a weakness.\n\nGERWIG: With any project, I\u2019m completely in it. I can\u2019t really connect it to other things I\u2019ve done. But then when I step back from it, I think, \u201cOh, these are connected in some way.\u201d I think I\u2019m just interested in the gleeful messiness of life and people. And I\u2019m interested in women. I don\u2019t know, I like them a lot. And I\u2019m interested in women talking to each other through generations. The unwieldy nature of living life is not something that always has to be organized. It can kind of live in its own wildness.AP: There\u2019s comfort in the idea that it can all be true.\n\nGERWIG: The hope of stepping into everything, was allowing it to all be equally true. I think of the character of Sasha who dismantles Barbie. I wanted everything she said to be absolutely true. And also other things that are true at the same time. That\u2019s always the place that feels most accurate to me.AP: There was a Guardian piece, I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve read it, about indie directors \u201cselling out.\u201d I feel like this is related, that \u201cBarbie\u201d can be a Mattel movie and also a piece of legitimate art and expression as well. And also, like your characters, you\u2019re ensuring your economic independence while getting your ideas out to the biggest audience possible.\n\nGERWIG: I haven\u2019t read it. I\u2019m sure they make good points, probably. There\u2019s always some tension, obviously, between art that exists in the world to be seen and consumed. I joked at the beginning that I\u2019m not Emily Dickinson, but I really am not Emily Dickinson. I\u2019m not writing poems on the back of envelopes and creating and destroying worlds from the confines of my home and never letting anybody see it. I\u2019m making art to be seen by people.\n\nI am not comparing myself to this person at all, but one of the first things when I was a kid was (Sacramento\u2019s) version of Shakespeare in the Park. I got to be part of it when I was 11. I had one line but I loved it, I would go backstage and just watch everyone. It was \u201cThe Merry Wives of Windsor,\u201d which was created because the fans liked the character of Falstaff. That\u2019s true. He was a fan favorite in \u201cHenry IV\u201d and, like, someone said could you write a play that\u2019s like, a spinoff. And Shakespeare was like, you got it. And it\u2019s amazing. And it\u2019s also a spinoff of a character. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m like Shakespeare, but I do think that sort of tension is part of what I like about all of it. We all live in this mess. Except for Emily Dickinson. But she\u2019s the only one."

    "text": "HANOI, July 3 (Reuters) - Vietnam has banned Warner Bros' highly-anticipated film \"Barbie\" from domestic distribution over a scene featuring a map that shows China's unilaterally claimed territory in the South China Sea, state media reported on Monday.\n\nThe U-shaped \"nine-dash line\" is used on Chinese maps to illustrate its claims over vast areas of the South China Sea, including swathes of what Vietnam considers its continental shelf, where it has awarded oil concessions.\n\n\"Barbie\" is the latest movie to be banned in Vietnam for depicting China's controversial nine-dash line, which was repudiated in an international arbitration ruling by a court in The Hague in 2016.

    "text": "As we bide our time until opening night, EW has compiled everything you need to know about the cast of Barbie.\n\nSomething must have changed along the way because nearly everyone involved with the production of Barbie seems to agree that Gerwig's interpretation of the iconic character is both feminist and funny.\n\nThough Amy Schumer was originally attached to develop Mattel's signature feature, the comedian left the project when it was clear that executives at Mattel didn't see eye-to-eye with her feminist vision. \"They definitely didn't want to do it the way I wanted to do it, the only way I was interested in doing it,\" she told Andy Cohen on an episode of Watch What Happens Live.\n\nIt's quite possibly the most anticipated film of the year so far. Greta Gerwig 's Barbie , starring Margot Robbie as the eponymous doll and Ryan Gosling as Ken, finally arrives in theaters on July 21, 2023, after spending the better part of a decade in development. Gerwig's involvement was first announced in 2019, marking the 60th anniversary of Barbie herself.\n\n01 of 24 Margot Robbie (Barbie) Han Myung-Gu/WireImage, Warner Brothers Margot Robbie began acting in her native Australia on the soap Neighbors and rose to international fame with her barnstorming turn in Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), followed by playing Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad (2016), James Gunn's superior sequel The Suicide Squad (2021), and Cathy Yan's invigorating Birds of Prey (2020). She soon earned two Oscar nominations for her brilliant turn as Tonya Harding in I, Tonya (2017) and her role in Bombshell (2019) before turning heads as Sharon Tate in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. In 2022, Robbie starred in an absolute mess called Amsterdam, as well as the similarly maximalist Babylon. More recently, she played a small but pivotal role in Wes Anderson's delightful, thoughtfully constructed Asteroid City (2023). Robbie has been married to producer Tom Ackerley since 2016. The couple met on the set of the 2014 film Suite Fran\u00e7aise, and founded LuckyChap Entertainment together the following year. Along with Barbie, the company has produced her costar Emerald Fennell's Promising Young Woman and I, Tonya, as well as the Netflix series Maid (2021) and upcoming spins on Ocean's 11 and Tank Girl. (Rejoice!) As for why she signed on to play Barbie, Robbie cited the casting as part of her motivation. \"I don't think I would have wanted to attempt to make a Barbie film if there wasn't a wide diversity of Barbies and Kens,\" she told Time. \"I don't think you should say, 'This is the one version of what Barbie is, and that's what women should aspire to be and look like and act like.'\"\n\n02 of 24 Ryan Gosling (Ken) Mathew Tsang/Getty, Warner Brothers Former Mouseketeer Ryan Gosling got his first acting credit on a 1995 episode of Are You Afraid of the Dark? Since then, the actor has carved a spacious nook for himself on the top shelf of Hollywood. His most notable works include the classic weepy The Notebook (2004), his Oscar-nominated turn in Half Nelson (2006), Lars and the Real Girl (2007), Blue Valentine, the neo-noir action-thriller Drive, George Clooney's Ides of March, and the romantic comedy Crazy, Stupid, Love. Gosling generated further buzz by headlining Adam McKay's The Big Short (2015) and the refreshing comedy The Nice Guys (2016) before earning another Oscar nom for singing and dancing his way through La La Land with Emma Stone and cruising through Blade Runner 2049 in 2017. He then took a four-year break to spend more time with his wife, Eva Mendes (whom he met on the set of The Place Beyond the Pines in 2011), and their two daughters. The actor currently has four projects in development, including the update of The Fall Guy and Margot Robbie's purported Ocean's 11 prequel. Playing Ken has given Gosling a new respect for the character, who the actor has found himself defending as of late. \"It is funny, this kind of clutching-your-pearls idea of, like, #notmyken,\" he told GQ in May 2023. \"Like you ever thought about Ken before this?\u2026 No, you didn't. You never did. You never cared.\" Gosling continued: \"If you ever really cared about Ken, you would know that nobody cared about Ken. So your hypocrisy is exposed. This is why his story must be told.\"\n\n03 of 24 Michael Cera (Allan) Jon Kopaloff/Getty, Warner Brothers Michael Cera grew up in Canada and made a name for himself as George-Michael Bluth, Jason Bateman's awkward teenage son, on Arrested Development (2003\u20132018). He went on to appear in 2007's Superbad and Juno, Nick and Nora' Infinite Playlist (2008), Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010), and as \"himself\" in This Is the End (2013). He has since appeared on Broadway in the Kenneth Lonergan plays Lobby Hero (2018), for which he received a Tony nomination for Best Featured Actor, and The Waverly Gallery (2018). Cera is also a musician, having contributed to the soundtracks of both Scott Pilgrim and Nick and Nora, as well as mandolin and backing vocals to the Weezer track \"Hang On.\" His song \"Best I Can,\" featuring Sharon Van Etten, was nominated for a 2017 Critics' Choice Award for Best Song Featured in a Documentary, though his 2014 cover of \"Clay Pigeons\" by Blaze Foley remains his most popular musical work to date. In 2022, Cera revealed that he is a father to a young son with his wife, Nadine.\n\n04 of 24 Will Ferrell (Mattel CEO) Dominik Bindl/WireImage, Warner Brothers After a tenure on some of the most fruitful seasons of Saturday Night Live, Will Ferrell segued into a successful acting and producing career in television and film. Along with Adam McKay, Ferrell created some of the most enduring comedies of the 21st century: Anchorman, Talladega Nights, Step Brothers, and The Other Guys. Another noteworthy Ferrell flick is Blades of Glory (2006), where he and Jon Heder star as disgraced figure skaters. Ferrell has also been successful in more dramatic roles, namely in films Everything Must Go (2010) and Downhill (2020). Through his and McKay's Gary and Gloria Sanchez Productions, Ferrell has produced Eastbound and Down, Booksmart (2019), Hustlers (2019), Dead to Me, Succession, and The Menu (2022). Ferrell has been married to Viveca Paulin, with whom he has three children, since 2000. As for his role as the CEO of Mattel, the company behind the real-life Barbie doll, Ferrell has been singing his praises for the anticipated blockbuster. \"It is, in my humble opinion, the ultimate example of high art and low art,\" Ferrell told WSJ. Magazine. \"It's a loving homage to the brand and, at the same time, couldn't be more satirical \u2014 just an amazing comment on male patriarchy and women in society and why Barbie's criticized and yet why every little girl still wants to play with Barbie. Boy, when I read it, I was like, 'This is fantastic.'\"\n\n05 of 24 Helen Mirren (Narrator) Daniele Venturelli/Getty, Warner Brothers One of the most celebrated and decorated actors of all time, Helen Mirren boasts a staggering amount of credits to her name. She rose to acclaim in The Long Good Friday (1980) and Excalibur (1981). Mirren then won an Oscar for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II in The Queen (2006), and has taken on action-hero roles in Red (2010) and its 2013 sequel, along with 2023's Shazam: Fury of the Gods. Other notable credits include films Gosford Park (2001) and Hitchcock (2012). Mirren will soon appear in the biopic Golda, in which she plays former Israeli prime minister Golda Meir. Mirren has known Gerwig since they starred together in the entirely forgotten 2011 remake of Arthur, so the veteran actor jumped at the opportunity to be a part of Barbie. \"We formed a bond together, Mirren told Vanity Fair. \"She's an amazing visionary and an extraordinary talent.\" Though she voices the narrator, whether or not she'll appear on screen in the finished film is still a mystery. \"I did shoot an appearance, but whether that's gotten to stay in the movie, I don't know.\" Mirren has been married to director Taylor Hackford (Ray) since 1997.\n\n06 of 24 Kate McKinnon (Weird Barbie) CHRIS DELMAS/AFP via Getty, Warner Brothers Former Saturday Night Live MVP Kate McKinnon has stolen scenes in the films Masterminds (2016), Paul Feig's Ghostbusters (2016), Rough Night (2017), and The Spy Who Dumped Me (2018). In 2019, she starred in Danny Boyle's Yesterday and opposite Margot Robbie in Bombshell. As for television, McKinnon won two Emmys for SNL, has done voicework for Family Guy and The Simpsons, and starred in the underwhelming miniseries Joe vs. Carole, based on the infamous feud in Netflix's Tiger King. She's currently filming Andrew Stanton's sci-fi flick In the Blink of an Eye. When speaking to Fandango about her thoughts after reading the Barbie script, McKinnon shared her appreciation for the fact that it explores how \"gender roles deny people half their humanity,\" adding that it's a \"very powerful message.\"\n\n07 of 24 Issa Rae (President Barbie) James Gourley/Getty, Warner Brothers Issa Rae first became known through her 2011 web series Awkward Black Girl. In 2016, HBO began airing Ray's debut television show Insecure, which garnered critical acclaim and 14 Emmy nominations (plus a win for editing) across its five seasons. During that time, she also started in the 2019 film Little alongside Regina Hall. Rae appeared opposite Kumail Nanjiani in the chaotic rom-com The Lovebirds (2020), and had a small role in B.J. Novak's exceptional thriller Vengeance (2022). In 2023, Rae voiced Spider-Woman in the massive hit Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Rae voiced her belief that Gerwig's approach to her cast and crew led to the overall harmony on set. \"She collaborates with people whose opinions she values, and she wants to make sure that she's hearing everyone out,\" Rae said. \"She's so great about funneling those thoughts through her own vision and heightening and elevating them\u2026Everyone had versions of how they wanted their Barbies or Kens to be, and I saw her take those ideas and make them her own in the best possible way.\"\n\n08 of 24 America Ferrera (Gloria) Han Myung-Gu/WireImage, Warner Brothers Superstore and Ugly Betty star America Ferrera plays a real-world character in Barbie who befriends the dolls when they arrive from Barbie Land. Ferrera's first film appearance was in Real Women Have Curves (2002), and she quickly netted more starring roles in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (2005) and its 2008 sequel, along with Lords of Dogtown (2005), a voice role in the How to Train Your Dragon films, and an unrecognizable turn in End of Watch (2012). Ferrera revealed on an episode of The Kelly Clarkson Show that she decided to wear a particularly fashionable outfit to the Barbie cast sleepover at the swanky Claridge's Hotel in London. \"Nobody told me that it was sexy Barbie sleepover,\" Ferrera protested. \"So everybody was in like, really pretty silky nightgowns and I was in the most grandma floral twin set you could imagine.\"\n\n09 of 24 Simu Liu (Ken) Kevin Mazur/Getty, Warner Brothers Canadian native Simu Liu had roles on shows such as Pacific Rim (2012), Orphan Black (2013\u20132017), Blood and Water (2015), Kim's Convenience (2016\u20132021), Taken (2017), and Slasher (2016\u2013present) before he joined the MCU as the titular hero in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021). That same year, he hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live. Liu joined his other Barbie cast members in praising their director while speaking to Vanity Fair in 2022. \"I remember very clearly about some of our big intricate dance sequences. Greta was very, very conscientious about who she cast,\" he said. \"We were able to cast people of different shapes, sizes, differently abled, to all participate in this dance \u2014 all under this message of: 'You don't have to be blonde, white, or X, Y, Z in order to embody what it means to be a Barbie or a Ken.'\"\n\n10 of 24 Kingsley Ben-Adir (Ken) PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty, Warner Brothers British actor Kingsley Ben-Adir got his start on the London stage before transitioning into television and film. He starred opposite Zo\u00eb Kravitz in Hulu's High Fidelity series adaptation and as Malcolm X in Regina King's One Night in Miami\u2026 (2020). Currently, Ben-Adir can be seen with Samuel L. Jackson in Marvel's Disney+ series Secret Invasion. Other noteworthy credits include Peaky Blinders, The OA, and King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. Ben-Adir told Variety he had no second thoughts about joining the production. \"From the first page, I was like, 'Wow, this is really, really funny!'... Then me and Greta went out for some whiskey. We spoke for two or three hours. There was a really strong sense from early on like she was trying to do something a little bit different,\" he said. \"It's very rare that a script like that comes along. So I was like, 'Whatever, whoever is in it, I just want to be on set with those guys and I want to be a part of it.'\"\n\n11 of 24 Ritu Arya (Journalist Barbie) Roy Rochlin/Getty, Warner Brothers Ritu Arya started acting through guest spots on British series such as Sherlock and Doctor Who before she landed a part in Paul Feig's Last Christmas (2019). That same year, she joined The Umbrella Academy in a lead role as Lila Pitts. She went on to appear in five episodes of Feel Good (2020) and the raucous action comedy Red Notice (2021) alongside Ryan Reynolds and Dwyane Johnson, and in 2023 starred in the inspired genre mash-up Polite Society.\n\n12 of 24 Alexandra Shipp (Writer Barbie) Michael Buckner/Variety via Getty, Warner Brothers Alexandra Shipp rose to prominence by playing the late singer Aaliyah in Lifetime's biopic Aaliyah: The Princess of R&B (2014). She took over the role of Storm for Halle Berry in X-Men: Apocalypse (2016), which she reprised for Deadpool 2 in 2018 and in 2019's Dark Phoenix. Additionally, Shipp starred in the slasher satire Tragedy Girls (2017), Straight Outta Compton (2015), and Shaft (2019). More recently, she appeared in the bio-thriller Silk Road and alongside Andrew Garfield in Tick, Tick\u2026 Boom! in 2021. Like many other cast members, Shipp has praised Gerwig for encouraging each actor not to over-train for their role. \"Greta was really excited about everybody looking the way that Barbies should look, which is every shape and size,\" Shipp told Interview. \"I saw some of the film last week and it's really beautiful to see us all together looking like a gaggle of girls, but also a gaggle of dolls.\"\n\n13 of 24 Nicola Coughlan (Diplomat Barbie) Alexandre Schneider/Getty , Warner Brothers Before she was synonymous with the role of Penelope Featherington on Bridgerton, Nicola Coughlan starred as Clare Devlin in the stellar dramatic comedy Derry Girls (2018\u20132022). She's also appeared on the Hulu series Harlots, and will star alongside Nick Frost in the upcoming comedy Seize Them! \"Oh my God, I'd be so, so happy,\" Coughlan told PEOPLE when asked how her teenage self would view her success today. She elaborated that her career is \"what I've always wanted \u2014 and I think something about it happening to me not in my 20s, it makes me look at it with a different lens, and I appreciate it so much.\"\n\n14 of 24 Emerald Fennell (Midge) Dave Benett/Getty, Warner Brothers Actress, writer, and director Emerald Fennell is set to appear in Barbie as a non-Barbiefied character named Midge. After spending several seasons on Call the Midwife, her role as Camilla Parker Bowles on The Crown brought Fennell to international prominence. As for film, she appeared in The Danish Girl (2015), in Joe Wright's Anna Karenina (2012), and Pan (2015). In 2020, Fennell wrote and directed Promising Young Woman, a positively searing film that was nominated for multiple Oscars and earned Fennell a win for Best Original Screenplay. Her other notable writing credits include six episodes of Killing Eve and the short film Careful How You Go (2018).\n\n15 of 24 Sharon Rooney (Lawyer Barbie) Karwai Tang/WireImage, Warner Brothers Scottish stand-up comedian Sharon Rooney began her career on stage before netting roles in Scarlett Johansson's alien tone poem Under the Skin (2015), Dumbo (2019), and The Electrical Life of Louis Wain (2021). She also starred on the TV series My Mad Fat Diary and Finding Alice (2021). Rooney told Scottish outlet Daily Record about her positive takeaways from the Barbie set. \"I think what Barbie's taught me is that you can do anything and be everything because she's a woman who \u2014 literally \u2014 does everything,\" she said. \"I'd really love to write something of my own. I see how clever Greta is and how wonderful she is and such an amazing actress, but she also is a phenomenal director. And Margot as well, she's an outrageously brilliant actress, but she's also got a fantastic production company.\"\n\n16 of 24 Dua Lipa (Mermaid Barbie) Cindy Ord/MG23/Getty, Warner Brothers London-born pop star Dua Lipa jump-started her career by posting covers of popular songs on YouTube. She released her first single, \"New Love,\" in 2015. Two years later, the artist issued her self-titled debut album, featuring hits \"New Rules\" and \"Be the One.\" Her second studio album, Future Nostalgia, represented a jump forward in her work with its airy, disco-dotted sound. She's since won three Grammys, including Best New Artist in 2019. Lipa has recorded new music for Barbie \u2014 along with Charli XCX, Haim, Ice Spice, Lizzo, Tame Impala, and even Ryan Gosling \u2014 and is currently working on her next solo studio album. Barbie is her first acting role, though she has a part in Matthew Vaughn's film Argylle coming in 2024.\n\n17 of 24 Hari Nef (Doctor Barbie) Pierre Suu/WireImage, Warner Brothers Hari Nef starred in the biographical drama Mapplethorpe and Sam Levinson's Assassination Nation in 2018, along with the comedies 1Up and Meet Cute. She's also appeared in episodes of Transparent, the controversial Max series The Idol, and the Sex and the City revival And Just Like That\u2026\" Nef landed her role in Barbie after posting an open letter to Gerwig and Robbie on social media expressing her ambivalence for the term \"doll\" as a transgender woman. \"Identity politics and cinema aren't my favorite combination, but the name BARBIE looms large over every American woman,\" Nef wrote. \"Barbie's the standard; she's The Girl; she's certainly THE doll. 'Doll' is fraught, glamorous; she is, and she isn't. We call ourselves 'the dolls' in the face of everything we know we are, never will be, hope to be. We yell the word because the word matters. And no doll matters more than Barbie.\"\n\n18 of 24 Emma Mackey (Physicist Barbie) Antoine Flament/Getty, Warner Brothers Despite her roles in high-profile movies such as Death on the Nile (2022), the Gothic drama Emily (2023), and the dramedy series Sex Education, Emma Mackey marks being on the set of Barbie the highlight of her career thus far. \"It was the most fun I've ever had in my life. It was wonderful. It's being helmed by people who know what they're doing and who care and who are in the best possible circumstances to do their job,\" Mackey told Total Film. \"When they're in their element, and you see other people confident and calm in what they're doing, then you feel competent and calm, and you want to make them proud and you want to do the best job possible. It's all a very healthy work environment to be in. Those opportunities don't come by all the time so you've got to take them when you can.\"\n\n19 of 24 Ncuti Gatwa (Ken) Taylor Hill/WireImage, Warner Brothers Mackey's Sex Education costar Ncuti Gatwa \u2014 who currently serves as the Fifteenth Doctor on the long-running sci-fi darling Doctor Who \u2014 was cast in Barbie after Mackey, though he told Elle she kept his casting a secret until he had secured the role. \"...She knew I was going to be in the film because my name was in the script already,\" Gatwa said. \"She kept it a secret for a month! When I found out I got the part I called her singing the Aqua 'Barbie' song.\" As for reuniting with Mackey, Gatwa felt it to be a blessing. \"We had just had such an intense five years together where we all became so close. We love each other so much and it's incredibly exciting seeing everyone go off and do their own things, but to be able to come back together? That's a magical experience.\"\n\n20 of 24 Ana Cruz Kayne (Supreme Court Justice Barbie) Gabriele Holtermann/UPI/Shutterstock, Warner Brothers Ana Cruz Kayne has an impressive list of credits to her name, including the inventive sci-fi film Another Earth (2011), the CBS crime drama series Bull, Louis C.K.'s sitcom Louie, the Tom Selleck drama Blue Bloods, and the upcoming Netflix series Painkiller. She also appeared in Gerwig's brilliant adaptation of Little Women (2019). Kayne took particular pleasure in bringing visibility to the Barbie universe. \"It was just so powerful to get to sit there as a woman of color, as the head of the Supreme Court,\" Kayne told The Messenger. \"It was everything you'd hope for. And because it's Barbie, it's power with a wink. So it felt very fitting.\"\n\n21 of 24 John Cena (Merman Ken) Michael Tran/FilmMagic Former professional wrestler John Cena is tied with Ric Flair for the most world championship reigns within the WWE. In the last 10 years, Cena has also become an ever-present actor, proving his comedy chops in Judd Apatow's Trainwreck (2015) and the raunchy comedy Blockers (2018) while also playing a villain in Bumblebee (2018). Cena later joined both The Suicide Squad (a role which he reprised in Max's Peacemaker series) and the Toretto family in F9: The Fast Hour (2021) and Fast X (2023). He also hosts the game show Wipeout alongside Nicole Byer. Cena has been married to Shay Shariatzadeh since October 2020. Cena revealed on the Today show that he actually pitched himself for the role \"in an accidental run-in with Margot Robbie.\" Reportedly, Cena told Robbie that he \"will do, pretty much, whatever you guys need 'cause I really enjoy the movie. And they asked me if I wanted to be a merman.\"\n\n22 of 24 Connor Swindells (Mattel Intern) Stuart C. Wilson/Getty, Warner Brothers Yet another star of Sex Education, Connor Swindells has also appeared in the miniseries Vigil (2021) and SAS: Rogue Heroes (2022-present). His film appearances include The Vanishing (2019) opposite Gerard Butler and the Jane Austen adaptation Emma (2020).\n\n23 of 24 Scott Evans (Ken) Kevin Winter/Getty, Warner Brothers Scott Evans has appeared in an enviable list of features, including The Lovely Bones (2009), Confessions of a Shopaholic (2009), and Almost Love (2020), and the TV series Grace and Frankie and White Collar. Having not appeared in any summer blockbusters up until this point, Evans couldn't believe the opportunity when he was cast in Barbie. \"I would say 'lost it' is a very big understatement!\" Scott told ET Online. \"When I found out that I got it, it was kind of just like a moment of processing and then it was a moment of, 'I have to go, I have people to call!' Oh my God, the first day of shooting, I was looking around the room. I'm like, 'OK, I know every single person in this room. Do I belong?'\""

Margot Robbie showed Architectural Digest around the DreamHouse set, revealing everything from a multi-story slide to an intricately designed wardrobe.\n\nInside Ken's room\n\nInside Ken's room\n\nThe outdoor gym\n\nThe barbecue area\n\nAbout the house\n\nThe house is built across three different floors and has a slide leading from the first floor to the ground floor lawn.\n\nIn the middle of the property is a disco-themed roller rink, overlooking an infinity pool, outdoor sofa area and Malibu beach.\n\nKen's bedroom opens up onto the lawn and pool, and is kitted out with cowboy-themed decor as well as a wardrobe ready to be raided by the guests.\n\nAn outdoor gym and pink-covered barbecue station is in the garden, as well as a rooftop hangout spot with a telescope to look out over the ocean.\n\nOf course Barbie has no need to eat while she's in residence so there is no fully-functioning kitchen on the site, but thankfully for the Airbnb guests catering comes with the trip.\n\nThe roller rink\u2014with a disco ball hanging overhead\u2014looks out over the sea and has a light-up floor and DJ booth ready for guests to dance the night away.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nMore from Fortune:\n\n5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year\u2014all while working from home\n\nLooking to make extra cash?

But I knew Greta was gonna have a lot to say, and I knew she was gonna Trojan Horse a lot of -- big issues within a very fun world.\"\n\n\"It's a way to look at something through the eyes of the Kens where you think, 'Oh, I see what they've done there,'\" Gerwig said. \"It's not so great when you're the accessory.\"\n\n\"Barbie\" director Greta Gerwig appears in this still from a taped interview for ABC News.

    "text": "This surely wasn\u2019t the kind of publicity that Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie was hoping for. The long-awaited film adaptation of the Mattel doll made headlines when, two weeks before its July 21 theatrical debut, it was banned in, of all places, Vietnam. And not because of any explicit violence or plastic nudity, but for violating the country\u2019s territorial sovereignty.\n\nThe controversy concerns a map of the \u201creal world\u201d that appears when Margot Robbie\u2019s Barbie is told she must leave Barbieland and enter the real world after her perfectly arched feet have inexplicably turned flat. Shown for only a split second, the map looks as if it were drawn by a child \u2014 one who likes bright colors and has failed geography class. Among a mess of shapes and scribbles, one oddly specific detail stood out to reviewers from Vietnam\u2019s National Film Evaluation Council: a dotted, U-shaped trail crossing into the ocean from what\u2019s supposed to be China.\n\nAs far as the council is concerned, this is no ordinary doodle, but a clear and deliberate representation of the so-called nine-dash line: a maritime boundary demarcating Beijing\u2019s contested ownership of the South China Sea. The line has been featured on Chinese maps since the 1940s and, despite being rejected by the International Court of Justice in The Hague in 2016, is still used today to justify the expansion of China\u2019s naval presence in the region, its construction of artificial islands, and its intimidation of foreign fishermen.\n\n\u201cTo the Chinese, the nine-dash line signifies their legitimate claims to the South China Sea,\u201d Peter Zinoman, a professor of history and Southeast Asian studies at UC Berkeley and author of The Colonial Bastille: A History of Imprisonment in Vietnam, 1862-1940, tells Vox. \u201cTo the Vietnamese, it symbolizes a brazen act of imperialist bullying that elevates Chinese national interest over an older shared set of interests of socialist brotherhood.\u201d For this reason, Barbie will not be screening in Vietnamese theaters.\n\nTo some extent, however, the damage has already been done. \u201cAs if the balancing act of stoking and restraining domestic nationalism wasn\u2019t hard enough,\u201d NYU professor and historian of modern Vietnam Kevin Li tells Vox, \u201cpressure from an outside voice actively calling the government\u2019s legitimacy into question on territorial grounds complicates things further. The Republic of Vietnam had, after all, fought the Chinese for [the South China Sea] during the last years of the Vietnam War. In my view, banning [Barbie] was a no-brainer.\u201d\n\nThe film has also raised security concerns in Washington, where politicians doubt the Warner Bros. Film Group\u2019s assertion that the map\u2019s resemblance to the nine-dash line was purely accidental. \u201cWhile it may just be a Barbie map in a Barbie world,\u201d Mike Gallagher, a Republican representative of Wisconsin leading the House\u2019s China committee, told Politico, \u201cthe fact that a cartoonish, crayon-scribbled map seems to go out of its way to depict the PRC\u2019s unlawful territorial claims illustrates the pressure that Hollywood is under to please CCP censors.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that American studios cater to China and its $4.6 billion film industry \u2014 they have been doing so for over two decades, at times to great success. However, the nature of their partnership is changing. The way it used to work, Wall Street Journal reporter Erich Schwartzel tells Vox, \u201cHollywood producers would bend over backward to appeal to Chinese audiences. If they thought casting a Chinese actor in a small role or filming certain scenes in China would help sell tickets there, they would do that.\u201d Think Disney adding a panda character to the Chinese release of Zootopia, or Transformers 4: Age of Extinction being partially set in Hong Kong and starring Li Bingbing and Han Geng in addition to a host of extras selected through a Chinese reality show.\n\n\u201cThat kind of reverse engineering has died down,\u201d adds Schwartzel, who wrote a book on the subject titled Red Carpet: Hollywood, China, and the Global Battle for Cultural Supremacy. \u201cNow, it\u2019s more about not including anything in your movie that risks angering the state.\u201d This explains why Doctor Strange changed the ethnicity of the Ancient One, a spiritual leader living in a mountainous monastery, from Tibetan to Caucasian, why Bohemian Rhapsody removed all references to Freddie Mercury being gay, and why Top Gun: Maverick originally removed the Taiwanese flag from Pete Mitchell\u2019s flight jacket. (It reappeared after protests from fans and the departure of investor Tencent; as a result, the film never played in China.)\n\nStill, there is an important difference between, say, turning a film\u2019s antagonist from Chinese to North Korean, as was done in the 2012 Red Dawn remake, and displaying a map that recognizes Beijing\u2019s highly disputed control over the vast majority of the South China Sea. As the theatrical world shrinks, the CCP\u2019s control over Chinese society tightens, and the cooling of US-China relationship complicates international business relations, we might soon end up in a reality where \u2014 in addition to removing content that offends Beijing \u2014Hollywood will \u201cgo out of its way,\u201d as Gallagher had put it, to insert content affirming the party\u2019s worldview.\n\n\u201cAiming for the PRC market, they are ready to accept the PRC\u2019s view of geography. Disinformation works by repetition.\u201d\n\nThis, many believe, was the case for Barbie. \u201cThe producers of the movie clearly hope it will be a blockbuster,\u201d Hue-Tam Ho Tai, professor of Sino-Vietnamese history at Harvard University, tells Vox. \u201cAiming for the PRC market, they are ready to accept the PRC\u2019s view of geography. Disinformation works by repetition.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting Barbie has already been approved to screen in China, and that manufacturer Mattel has a vested interest in selling its dolls there.\n\nOf course, affirming the CCP worldview comes at a cost. Barbie isn\u2019t the first film to reference the nine-dash line, nor is it the first to be banned in Southeast Asia for doing so. Before surfacing in Barbieland, the line could be discovered in scenes from DreamWorks\u2019 animated family film Abominable, Sony\u2019s live-action adaptation of the video game series Uncharted starring Tom Holland, and an Australian spy drama streaming on Netflix called Pine Gap. Earlier this year, Vietnam even blacklisted John Wick: Chapter 4 for starring Donnie Yen, who is a vocal supporter of CCP policies. (John Wick was briefly available in China but has since been pulled from its platforms alongside other movies with Keanu Reeves after the actor attended a Tibet-related concert.)\n\nSoon, Hollywood will also be facing resistance from the US government, which up until this point has remained largely offscreen. Alarmed by Beijing\u2019s influence over American entertainment, the Pentagon recently announced in a Defense Department document that it will no longer share its bases, ships, and equipment with productions that allow Beijing \u201cto censor the content of the project in a material manner to advance the national interest of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u201d\n\nSchwartzel suggests it is economic incentive, not political pressure, that could ultimately push Hollywood out of China altogether. As time goes by, breaking into the country\u2019s film market has only gotten more difficult. This is partly due to censorship, but also because of cultural barriers. \u201cChinese audiences were always much savvier than Hollywood believed them to be,\u201d he says. \u201cA panda in Zootopia is nice, but it is not the real reason people are going to see it.\u201d The same applies to casting Chinese actors in small, forgettable roles, which in China are mockingly referred to as \u201cflower vases.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s competition from Chinese cinema, which has grown incredibly sophisticated over the past decade or so. In 2011, Transformers: Dark of the Moon was the highest-grossing film in China. Ten years later, in 2021, it was The Battle at Lake Changjin, a historical action epic about the People\u2019s Volunteer Army\u2019s unlikely victory over the US Armed Forces in a major battle during the Korean War. Commissioned by the PRC\u2019s Central Propaganda Department, it brought in an estimated $903 million against an impressive $200 million budget \u2014 numbers Hollywood can only dream of at the moment.\n\nWhile the past and present prevalence of Chinese propaganda in American entertainment poses a significant danger for Americans, who may not always recognize it when it\u2019s in front of them, the situation is even worse for countries not powerful enough to confront China head-on."

    "text": "Greta Gerwig breathes life into the iconic Barbie doll with her upcoming film Barbie, premiering in theaters on July 21. Starring Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, the movie has been gaining attention for its strong marketing campaign, which includes partnerships with Airbnb; Crocs; Burger King; and many other food, clothing, accessory, furniture and household product brands. The film also uses Barbie\u2019s long trajectory as a toy and brand to reflect on issues of gender, feminism, body image and the American dream.\n\n\n\nTo understand more about Barbie\u2019s world, Dustin Kidd, professor of sociology in the College of Liberal Arts, and Sheri Lambert, professor marketing in Fox School of Business, answer questions about who Barbie is and what she represents in American culture.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nThe way that the Barbie doll has changed over the years reflects the way that women\u2019s role in American society has changed.\n\nBarbie\u2019s marketing strategy is unique in that the movie is being marketed directly to women and has partnered with a large number of other brands.\n\nBarbie\u2019s presence in the imagination of Americans of all ages makes her primed for projections of ideas about feminism, but also for brand partnerships.\n\nWhat does the Barbie doll say about American culture?\n\nOver the past few decades, the concept of the American dream has shifted from a story about hard work and achievement to a story about consumerism and having it all. Work is ephemeral, which is why Barbie is easily imagined within a host of different careers. If the owner of a Barbie doll wants to shift their Barbie\u2019s career from doctor to rock \u2018n\u2019 roll singer (ignoring the fact that Barbie is supposedly 19), they need only buy another outfit or another doll.\n\n\u2013Dustin Kidd\n\nBarbie has been on a growth curve. She\u2019s grown up, just like the women of 2023. She\u2019s fearless, she\u2019s going out into the real world. That wasn\u2019t the case for Barbie in the \u201970s when I was playing with her as a kid\u2014Barbie was unrealistic, in terms of her physical attributes, which are unattainable for any real person, but also emotionally. But now Barbie sends a message that little girls can be whoever they want, whether that\u2019s a doctor, astronaut, whatever. The Barbie brand has done a good job of keeping up with changes in expectations of women over the years, and they\u2019ve put it on steroids for women in 2023, saying that they can be fearless, they can truly do anything.\n\n\u2013Sheri Lambert\n\nWhat does the marketing of the Barbie movie say about American culture?\n\nIt says that we like hype. We like themed things. What the Barbie brand has done is incredible\u2014they\u2019ve built so much excitement and there are so many collaborations with other brands, like washable rugs, Gap, nail polish, couches, everything. Everything is pink.\n\n\u2013Sheri Lambert\n\nWhat is special about the way that the Barbie movie has been marketed to the public?\n\nIt\u2019s special in that big blockbuster movies aren\u2019t usually marketed to women. The film industry (and the auto industry) doesn\u2019t market to women well, but it\u2019s time that they market more to women because women have so much buying power. So Barbie is glomming on to the female target, and the female market is going to buy this brand. And they\u2019re also going to take kids to this movie, and it\u2019s great that it\u2019s fun for men, too. The marketing of Barbie is also special because they\u2019re selling two brands at once: the movie and the toy. And they\u2019ve marketed it so that they\u2019re collaborating and selling both at once.\n\n\u2013Sheri Lambert\n\nWhy is there so much interest in the Barbie movie? Is it just good marketing or is there something deeper?\n\nThe centrality of marketing in the Barbie universe does not undermine the wide range of important meanings that Barbie has for her audience\u2014both doll owners and filmgoers. Meaning is a complex negotiation between creators and the audience, and no one is better at making meaning than kids playing with toys. Whatever stories that Barbie\u2019s inventor Ruth Handler might have had for the doll, whatever stories Mattel may have added over the years, and whatever stories that Greta Gerwig might introduce in the new film, the Barbie fans will always have the ultimate say over what Barbie means to them.\n\n\u2013Dustin Kidd\n\nThe marketing of Barbie is fantastic. It touches on everything we teach in a marketing degree program. They\u2019ve covered every angle. They are reaching consumers at every point in their journey: building awareness, buying the product, following up afterwards.\n\n\u2013Sheri Lambert\n\nWhy is the Barbie movie especially well-suited for all of its brand partnerships?\n\nBecause it\u2019s fun, and people want to be happy. Barbie and Ken are fun and happy. Pink is a fun, happy color, and brands are jumping on the bandwagon. Emotion sells\u2014happiness sells, sadness sells, sex appeal sells.\n\n\u2013Sheri Lambert\n\nIn the world of Barbie, jobs are reduced to outfits while consumerism is tangible. There is no shortage of dolls to purchase (various Barbies and her friends), outfits, cars, furniture, decor, etc. Barbie has always been a massive marketing machine, and the movie just takes that to another level. Barbie the doll lives inside a fantasy house and a fantasy world that Barbie owners can buy and constantly expand. Using brand tie-ins for a movie is nothing new, but no movie has ever been more primed for an onslaught of tie-ins than this one. It\u2019s an imagination loop. The products that you buy for your Barbie doll expand her world into something that mimics the real world. The movie tie-ins expand the audience\u2019s world to mimic the world of Barbie.\n\n\u2013Dustin Kidd\n\nIs Barbie a feminist?\n\nWhether or not Barbie is a feminist depends a lot on the interpretation and interests of the audience members. When it comes to these issues, we put a lot of pressure on single stories, demanding that Barbie or Beyonc\u00e9 or Taylor or Awkwafina be all things to all people. The best way for our entertainment industry to be more feminist is to open the door to more diverse storytellers and let them tell the stories that matter to them.\n\n\u2013Dustin Kidd\n\nMargot Robbie plays Barbie as a fierce woman who is fearless and going out in the real world. Barbie represents how women can do anything now. For young women, it\u2019s saying they can be anything they want to be with hard work and perseverance. The movie is a feminist masterpiece\u2014Barbie represents female empowerment, women being fearless.\n\n\u2013Sheri Lambert\n\nIs Barbie a good role model?\n\nSignificantly, this movie is being released in the midst of strikes by both the writers and the actors that make our entertainment industry run. If we can renegotiate how we tell stories through mass culture, we have the chance to make storytelling more equitable. In turn, those stories may help to effect change and make for a more equitable reality. If Barbie fans are inspired to build a more equitable world, then the answer is yes, but that is up to the fans.\n\n\u2013Dustin Kidd\n\n"

And it's doing so well, I'm seeing it everywhere.\"\n\nAnother thing Ali thinks has helped the film are the posters, which people could edit themselves into and \"encouraged a lot of people to make their own\".\n\nHe says Barbie's marketing campaign is a stark contrast to Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, which is released on the same day.\n\nAnd while lots of people are planning to watch both on 21 July - in what's been dubbed Barbenheimer - Ali says Oppenheimer has taken a more traditional approach.\n\n\"That's a movie about the man who helped create the Manhattan Project and the atomic bomb,\" he says.\n\n\"So you can't sell toys off the back of that, you can't sell fishing rods and shirts and hats and whatever random stuff they might be selling - it's just the movie.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nPeople were even talking about the film in June 2022 when Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were snapped filming scenes\n\nMoshe Isaacian is a senior brand consultant who compiled a viral Twitter thread listing many of the Barbie marketing stunts and licensing deals.\n\nAnd if the campaign has felt like it's been going on for ages, he says the planning has been years in the works.\n\nMoshe, who's worked with Nike and Amazon, says many of the deals have been \"a year, two years in the making\" and that Mattel have been \"very good at being selective\".\n\n\"It doesn't just feel like the regular licensing deals,\" he says.\n\n\"It's more like [they're selling] Barbie's lifestyle plan now - like this is how Barbie would dress up, talk, the things she would eat, what kind of candles she would have in her house.\n\n\"These are things that mostly an older generation care about.\"\n\nAli also thinks the film has an older, and wider, appeal than the audience the dolls are marketed at - partly because it's being directed by Little Women's Greta Gerwig.\n\nIn one teaser clip, Barbie asks her fellow dolls if they ever think about dying, and Ken asks Barbie if he can stay round her house - much to Barbie's bemusement.\n\n\"It doesn't feel to me like children will be watching a children's film. In fact, and this is just a guess, I suspect young children will be bamboozled by it.\"\n\nIn contrast to the marketing side of things, there's also been a level of secrecy around the actual film itself.\n\nBBC News hasn't been able to watch it yet but the few reviews that are out there are largely positive.\n\nSo, after months of build-up - is the expensive advertising campaign going to pay off?\n\n\"I think the opening weekend for Barbie is going to be huge even if it ends up being badly reviewed, and I don't think it will be,\" Ali says.\n\n\"The excitement is at such fever pitch that it's guaranteed I think to have people in cinemas watching it, if only to see the big names.\n\n\"But also so they have their own thoughts on the thing that will be the discussion topic in pop culture for the summer.\"\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube."

    "text": "Are there more Barbie stories to be told on the big screen? Greta Gerwig sure thinks so!\n\nSpeaking with PEOPLE for the special Barbie issue (out now) alongside stars Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling and more, the director and co-writer, 39, says she hopes her film \"is the launch of a world and a bunch of different Barbie movies.\"\n\n\"There\u2019s a tone and a humor and a joy, and obviously the world is so beautiful,\" Gerwig adds. \"I want to go back to Barbie Land.\"\n\nPraising Gerwig, Robbie, 33, tells PEOPLE, \"Greta has a very specific thing where she can be very silly and very clever at the same time, but it\u2019s also very heartfelt.\"\n\n\"Her humor never feels cynical or cold,\" continues the actress, who plays the titular doll alongside Gosling, 42, as Ken. \"It\u2019s always warm and loving, but also really, really silly and kind of zany and absurd. I actually think it\u2019s a bit of a throwback in tone. To be honest, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve seen a movie that utilizes that kind of comedy in a long, long time.\"\n\n\n\nNever miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human-interest stories.\n\n\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nGerwig's comments to PEOPLE about potential future Barbie film iterations come after Robbie addressed the possibility a TIME magazine cover story published last month.\n\n\"I think you fall into a bit of a trap if you try and set up a first movie whilst also planning for sequels,\" said the Oscar-nominated actress.\n\nStill, she has been part of conversations about what the future holds for Barbie in terms of a cinematic experience to follow the upcoming movie, in theaters later this month.\n\n\"It could go a million different directions from this point,\" Robbie said.\n\nFilm Name: BARBIE Copyright: \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Warner Bros.

Pictures\n\nAside from Robbie and Gosling, some of Barbie's stars include Kingsley Ben-Adir, Scott Evans, Simu Liu and Ncuti Gatwa, who appear as different versions of Ken in the film. Meanwhile, Hari Nef, Emma Mackey, Dua Lipa, Ana Cruz Kayne, Sharon Rooney, Kate McKinnon, Nicola Coughlan, Alexandra Shipp, Ritu Arya and Issa Rae play different versions of Barbie. Emerald Fennell will appear as Midge, and Michael Cera will play Allan.\n\nAt the time of the trailer's release, character posters were also unveiled for non-Barbie characters, including America Ferrera as \"a human,\" Ariana Greenblatt as another \"human,\" Helen Mirren as \"the narrator,\" Connor Swindells as an \"intern\" and Jamie Demetriou as \"a suit,\" plus Will Ferrell.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures\n\nAsked how she began thinking about Barbie as a character, Gerwig tells PEOPLE, \"Of course, I\u2019ve known who Barbie is for forever, and there\u2019s some sort of collective memory that I wanted to tap into, something about: We invent things like dolls to explain to ourselves what it means to be human.\"\n\n\"Part of me wondered if there was a way that we could allow the doll to also have that humanity,\" she adds. \"Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if the Queen of Plastic was given something real?\"\n\nBarbie is in theaters July 21.\n\nThe special Barbie movie issue of PEOPLE is on newsstands now."

    "text": "In case you didn't know, it's a Barbie world and we're just living in it. Not that we're complaining about the rise of Barbiecore or the endless stream of Barbie movie fashion inspiration courtesy of Margot Robbie, the film's cast, and devoted A-listers alike. There's something about Barbie \u2014 the doll, the brand, the idealogy \u2014 that's infinitely appealing and fashion girlies aren't the only ones to notice. As Barbie finally hits theaters, brands from every corner of the internet seem to have launched a Barbie collab, trademarked by Mattel and available for a limited time only.\n\nBrand collabs are nothing new, especially in fashion and beauty, but there's something about the sheer number and fervor of Barbie-branded collabs dropping this summer that feels overwhelming. Does the world need Barbie-branded sparkly platform heels? Sure, why not. How about whitening toothpaste? Well...\n\nRegardless of whether or not this summer's wild array of Barbie-branded products is necessary, they're here and we've rounded them all up \u2014 from jewelry to pool floats and ice cream flavors.\n\nB\u00e9is x Barbie\u2122 The Movie\n\n\"The jet set life, but make it Barbie\" is the vibe behind the collab between B\u00e9is, everyone's fave chic luggage brand, and Barbie, everyone's favorite pint-size world traveler. Shoppable starting on July 19, the collection features B\u00e9is bestsellers in a colorway so vividly pink no one by Barbie herself would mistakenly grab it off the luggage carousel.\n\nPrimark's Barbie\u00ae Capsule Collection\n\nFrom the swimsuit that started it all to Barbie\u00ae Land neon separates, Primark's 73-piece Barbie\u00ae Capsule Collection quite literally has it all. We're talking womenswear, menswear, pajamas, and accessories. If you want to dive headfirst into Barbie mania without breaking the bank, we suggest you begin your descent into madness at a Primark store near you.\n\nSMASH + TESS x Barbie\u2122\n\nWhile Basic Barbie doesn't quite have a ring to it, Barbie-themed basics are few and far between in a sea of over-the-top Mattel merch. Enter SMASH + TESS x Barbie. The infinitely wearable pieces in its Barbie collection are designed for mixing and matching. Plus, they're made in fair-wage paying factories which we think Barbie would be totally into.\n\nAlex and Ani x Barbie\u2122\n\nSummer's bubbliest blockbuster calls for a bit of bling which is exactly what jewelry brand Alex and Ani is delivering. Made for layering, its Barbie-branded necklaces, bracelets, and earrings deliver just a dash of Barbie sparkle that won't fade once the movie leaves theaters.\n\n\n\nBarbie\u2122 X Cotton On\n\nWe're not sure if the world needs all the Barbie collabs that have launched this summer, but we definitely want the Barbie\u2122 X Cotton On Moto Jacket. In addition to the retro moto, the nostalgia-heavy line includes hoodies, tanks, tops, and bottoms that'll let you show off your vintage Barbie fan street cred.\n\nBurger King x Barbie\n\nY'all. Maybe it's a good thing that this Barbie-themed bacon cheeseburger with mysterious pink sauce is only available in Brazil. We're not sure we want to know what it tastes like, but we imagine it contains notes of existential crisis.\n\nBarbie\u2122 and Joybird\n\nThe Barbie force is strong with this one. Joybird, known for its responsibly sourced furniture, has already dropped one Barbie Dreamhouse\u2122-themed collab and has a second on the way. Arriving on July 17, the limited-edition collection featured plush velvets in grown-up but glam jewel-tone alternatives to pink.\n\nBarbie\u2122 x Tangle Teezer\n\nFor those of us who grew up trying to unknot our Barbies' matted synthetic manes with useless doll-sized plastic combs, this collab might heal some childhood psychic wounds. Take it from this curly-haired writer: Tangle Teezer brushes are detangling machines and it totally makes sense to snag one of the line's two Totally Pink Barbie\u2122 brushes.\n\nBarbie\u2122 x Crocs\n\nLove them or hate them, you cannot escape Crocs, so it makes sense that this summer's most inescapable movie has teamed up with the brand for a Barbie-themed collection. The collab features Croc charms and a range of the divisive shoes in shades of Barbie pink. Even if you're morally opposed to Crocs, you have to admit the platform jelly Mega Crush Sandal is pretty cute.\n\nBarefoot Dreams x Barbie\u2122\n\nBed Rot Barbie may not exist, but if she did, she'd stay snuggly in the Barefoot Dreams x Barbie\u2122 Collection. It doesn't get cozier than the soft pink sweats, shorts, robes, and pullovers in this collab.\n\nBarbie\u2122 x Boohoo\n\nOut of all the Barbie fashion collabs, Boohoo's might be the most inclusive. With Barbie-branded hoodies, tees, and comfy separates in sizes 0-24, this collection will make the hearts of logomanics sing.\n\nBarbie\u2122 The Movie x Superga\n\nWe'll be honest, we're pretty bummed out that some of the Barbie-fied sneakers Barbie\u2122 The Movie x Superga collection are already sold out. While you can't snag a pair of the super-stacked 2802 Barbie Rainbow Sneakers, the collection's more casual sneakers are still shoppable.\n\nPinkberry's Barbie Land Berry Pink\n\nIf you like your froyo (symbolically) Barbie-flavored, we've got great news for you. Pinkberry's Barbie Land Berry Pink flavor, a blend of strawberry and dragonfruit frozen yogurt topped with Dream Sparkles (a mix of pink, white, and silver sprinkles and edible glitter, in case you were wondering) is available now for a limited time.\n\nBarbie\u2122 x Fossil\n\nThe best Barbie collabs let you show off your Barbie pride while also being wearable for the 364 days of the year you\u2019re not seeing Barbie: The Movie in theaters. The Barbie\u2122 x Fossil collection\u2019s luxe leather goods and watches are pure Barbie magic without being obvious about it.\n\nForever 21 x Barbie\u2122 Collection\n\nForever21's Barbie collection is one of the few collabs released this summer that contains actual Barbie dolls. Also included: fun graphic tees, terry cloth separates, and on-theme accessories.\n\nHomesick's Barbie\u2122 Dreamhouse\u2122 Candle\n\nLots of Barbie collabs answer questions fans may or may not have asked, including: What does Barbie's Dreamhouse smell like? If you're curious, Homesick has the answer. Its Barbie\u2122 Dreamhouse\u2122 Candle features base notes of sandalwood and velvet, lemon zest and pink jasmine in the middle, and top notes of sweet peony and rose bush.\n\nGap \u00d7 Barbie\u2122\n\nIt's Barbie(-trademarked) fun for the whole family! The Gap x Barbie\u2122 Collection is actually the most well rounded collab we've seen so far featuring tees, totes, and comfy separates for kids, adults, and even pets.\n\nCanada Pooch's Barbie\u2122 Collection\n\nIf you want more than one measly Barbie-branded dog hoodie option, Canada Pooch has you covered (No shade, Gap. We love your tote bags.) Canada Pooch's Barbie\u2122 Collection features pet attire and toys emblazoned with the Barbie logo and signature pink prints in a range of styles and fits.\n\nBarbie\u2122 The Movie x FUNBOY\n\nYou can now float around in it in true Malibu Barbie style thanks to FUNBOY's Barbie-branded pool float collection. This collection goes hard offering every imaginable form of Barbie transportation from yachts to surfboards, but, you know, as pool floats.\n\n\n\n\n\nBarbie\u2122 x MeUndies\n\nEveryone's favorite comfy printed undies are now available in a retro Barbie-themed print. They're perfect for anyone who likes their underwear to feature rollerblades, disco balls, and Barbie's classic swirled \"B.\"\n\nColdstone Creamery's All That Glitters is Pink\u2122\n\nAll That Glitters is Pink\u2122 starts with pink cotton candy ice cream layered with graham cracker pie crust and dance party sprinkles finished with whipped topping. It's a party in a bowl.\n\nTruly x Barbie\u2122 The Movie\n\nViral skincare brand Truly Beauty launched a Barbie-branded core collection back in May featuring Barbie-fied versions of the brand's best-loved products, like its whipped body butter and bikini serum.\n\nBarbie\u2122 x NYX Cosmetics\n\nThe cult fave-drugstore beauty brand's nine-piece Barbie collection leans into the technicolor brightness of it all. You can shop the line's lip butters and shadow palettes separately or splurge on a vault, collector-style.\n\nBarbie\u2122 x Kitsch\n\nAccessories brand Kitsch dropped several of its hero products, including satin pillowcases and silky scrunchies, in Barbie-bright colors and prints.\n\nBarbie\u2122 x Ruggable Collection\n\nIf seeing Barbie: The Movie just doesn't cut it for you, you can transform your home into an IRL Barbie\u2122 Dreamhouse\u2122 with some Mattel-sanctioned Barbie decor. Ruggable's Barbie collection is, shockingly, not a hot pink fever dream; its washable area rugs feature a range of soft pinks and even a black and beige chevron option.\n\nBarbie\u2122 The Movie x Impala Skate\n\nRiding high on the viral sensation caused by last summer's Barbie set stills, Impala has launched technicolor retro rollerblades, protective knee, elbow, and wrist guards, and, of course, Barbie-branded athletic crew socks.\n\nCHI x Barbie\u2122 Totally Hair Collection\n\nThis Ulta Beauty exclusive collection, featuring two hot tools and a travel case, have some notable Barbie hair-itage. All three products in the collection feature the trippy, colorful print worn by the bestselling \"Totally Hair\" Barbie released in 1992 (which Margot Robbie recently channeled).\n\nBarbie\u2122 x ALDO\n\nWe already told y'all. The collection of accessories, heels, and sneakers(!!!) is cute, affordable, and very, very pink.\n\nBarbie\u2122 x MOON Oral Care\n\nDid you know Barbie\u2122 the Movie has an exclusive oral beauty brand? It's MOON, and it features a two-piece set containing an electric toothbrush and whitening toothpaste. Yes, both are very pink.\n\nBarbie\u00ae x Hot Wheels\u00ae x rue21\n\nThis three-way collab has a whooping 29 pieces, all with a bit of a throwback vibe. It's available online and in-store.\n\nBarbie\u2122 x Swoon\n\nWhat is it? Pink lemonade with zero sugar. Why is it? The brand's founder is a Type 1 diabetic, and 10% of the collab's net sales support the Dream Gap Project. How much does it cost? Merch and case combos start at $30, but you can also buy a \"summer stock\" of Barbie\u2122 x Swoon Pink Lemonade for $5,500.\n\nBarbie\u2122 By PacSun\n\nBarbie\u2122 By PacSun leaned hard into the Malibu Barbie of it all with its \u201890s-inspired collection of tees, swimwear, and denim separates.\n\nBarbie\u2122 x Hally Shade Stix\n\nThe Barbie\u2122 x Hally Shade Stix from Hally Hair do what you'd expect: They temporarily deposit three Barbie-approved colors \u2014 Signature Pink, Malibu Blue, and Pump Up Purple \u2014 into your hair. According to the brand, the colors rinse out with a single wash. Also according to the brand, Barbie dolls are not included with purchase.\n\nShow Me Your Mumu x Barbie\u2122\n\nOkay, y'all. No cap, the Barbie\u2122 Babe One Piece from the Show Me Your Mumu x Barbie\u2122 Collection is legitimately adorable. The rest of the collection's swimwear, activewear, dresses, and separates is also pretty stinkin' cute.\n\nBarbie\u2122 x Posh Peanut\n\nEven (maybe especially?) toddlers and kids deserve the chance to flaunt their Barbie pride. Posh Peanut's Barbie collection delivers primarily pint-sized onesies, separates, and accessories for tiny Barbie fans along with pajamas for equally enthused parents.\n\n"

    "text": "The Barbie film has an iconic cast, through and through.\n\nBut while everyone's familiar with the big names of the cast, there's one name that some moviegoers might not have been familiar with \u2014 and they may not even be familiar with her face. They'll definitely know her work though.\n\nThat person is Oscar-winning costume designer Ann Roth.\n\nRoth is featured in the first trailer for Barbie and shares the cutest (and also funniest) scene with star Margot Robbie. While Robbie is having a bit of a tough moment, she encounters Roth on a bench, looks at her and tells her she's beautiful. Without batting an eye, Roth tells her that she knows, and the two of them laugh.\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone earlier this month, director and co-writer Greta Gerwig discussed Roth's cameo in her film.\n\n\"I love that scene so much,\u201d said Gerwig, adding that Roth is a \u201clegend.\u201d\n\nFurther breaking down the scene, Gerwig continued: \u201cIt\u2019s a cul-de-sac of a moment, in a way \u2014 it doesn\u2019t lead anywhere. And in early cuts, looking at the movie, it was suggested, \u2018Well, you could cut it. And actually, the story would move on just the same.\u2019 And I said, \u2018If I cut the scene, I don\u2019t know what this movie is about.\u2019\"\n\nThe tug-at-your-heart-strings bit, to Gerwig, is \u201cthe heart of the movie. The way Margot plays that moment is so gentle and so unforced.\u201d\n\nRoth, 91, has more than 100 credits to her name and has been nominated for five academy awards for her costume work. She's won two \u2014 for The English Patient and Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.\n\nShe's also notably worked with Gerwig's partner, Noah Baumbach, on three projects: Margot at the Wedding, While We're Young and White Noise. She's worked across movies, TV and theater and also took home a Tony Award in 2013 for The Nance.\n\nHan Myung-Gu/WireImage\n\nIn an exclusive interview with PEOPLE for the special Barbie issue (out now) alongside Robbie, Ryan Gosling and more, Gerwig couldn't help but be nostalgic about being in Barbie world.\n\n\"There\u2019s a tone and a humor and a joy, and obviously the world is so beautiful,\" Gerwig said. \"I want to go back to Barbie Land.\"\n\nShe may or may not have to wait for long for her return. Gerwig added that she hopes the movie, in theaters Friday July 21, \"is the launch of a world and a bunch of different Barbie movies.\"\n\nNever miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up to date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nJon Kopaloff/Getty I\n\nWhat\u2019s already proved to be worth the hype surrounding the film is the pink fashions, which were glimpsed at the height of the Barbie press tour.\n\nRobbie, 33, and her stylist Andrew Mukamal were extremely committed to paying tribute to the Barbie-verse with detailed looks inspired by dolls throughout the decades.\n\nAxelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic\n\nWhether she was quite literally stealing the carpet dressed up as the \u201860s Solo in the Spotlight figurine or channeling the 1992 Totally Hair Barbie in disco glam, the actress was all for bringing the Mattel icon to life even further.\n\n\u201cWe're finding Barbie references from decades past and just doing it really for the big Barbie fans out there, people who are actually collecting those Barbies. We're hoping to get them excited,\u201d Robbie told PEOPLE exclusively at the Barbie world premiere."

    "text": "Turns out, Greta Gerwig is less terrified of flaaaaaat feeeeet! than she is of CGI feet.\n\nThe director of the upcoming Barbie movie starring Margot Robbie said the studio entertained the idea of using CGI for the numerous Barbie actors to replicate their signature arched heels, but she immediately shut down the idea.\n\n\"There was a big discussion in the beginning,\" Gerwig said on Australian talk show The Project recently. \"Everyone said, 'Are you going to CGI all the feet?' And I thought, 'Oh god, no! That's terrifying! That's a nightmare.'\"\n\n\"Also,\" she added, \"Margot has the nicest feet. She has these beautiful dancer feet. I was like, 'She should just hang onto that bar and do it just like this.'\"\n\nRobbie, also a producer on the movie, previously confirmed that the shot Gerwig referred to featured her real feet, explaining that she did hold onto a bar to achieve the scene. \"I really don't like it when someone else does my hands or feet in an insert shot,\" she said in a recent Time cover story.\n\nGerwig added on The Project that the scene \"felt like a Bat Signal,\" as did the typography of the giant B on the Barbie Land sign, to mark the introduction of the iconic doll. \"Globally it's known, but also we kind of share this collective of what Barbie means,\" she said. \"Even though it's this huge movie, it feels very personal to me. It was made by so many people who cared about it.\"\n\nA real, human, non-CGI'd heel in 'Barbie'. Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nIn theaters July 21, Barbie follows Robbie's central titular character as she experiences an existential crisis, and thus embarks on a trip from Barbie Land to the real world for answers about all the strange things that have been happening in her life. The most alarming of all? Her feet are no longer arched, much to the terror of her fellow Barbies.\n\nAna Cruz Kayne, Sharon Rooney, Alexandra Shipp, Margot Robbie, Hari Nef, and Emma Mackey in 'Barbie'. Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nRyan Gosling, America Ferrera, Will Ferrell, Issa Rae, Michael Cera, and Hari Nef are among the star-studded cast.\n\nWatch Gerwig and Robbie discuss the feet scene and more above.\n\nWant more movie news?

    "text": "While this summer\u2019s hotly-anticipated \u201cBarbie\u201d movie has only dropped the vaguest hints about what fans can except, the British Board of Film Classification has offered some more clues after awarding the film a 12A rating on Monday.\n\nThe org, which is responsible for age rating films in the U.K., cited \u201cbleeped strong language,\u201d \u201cmoderate innuendo\u201d and \u201cdangerous behavior,\u201d referring to a scene in which \u201ca child melts a doll\u2019s hair using a lighter\u201d to explain the 12A classification.\n\nAmong the details that made the BBFC decide the film\u2019s younger audiences would require adult supervision are \u201ccomic fight scenes\u201d including \u201cpunches, kicks, headbutts and use of improvised weapons\u201d and \u201coccasional verbal references to death and mental health.\u201d According to the organization, fans can also expect to see a car chase.\n\nA scene that is briefly shown in the trailer \u2013 where Barbie punches a man after he slaps her butt \u2013 is also highlighted under \u201csexual violence and sexual threat.\u201d \u201cThere is a scene of sexual harassment in which men catcall a woman and make inappropriate comments about her appearance,\u201d says the BBFC report card. \u201cA man slaps a woman\u2019s bottom, however, his behaviour is immediately challenged and results in negative consequences.\u201d\n\nWhile most of the film\u2019s language is pretty tame, the BBFC warns it does includes \u201cbleeped strong language\u201d and \u201cmoderate bad language\u201d \u2014 citing the words \u201cmotherfucker\u201d and \u201cbitch\u201d \u2014 as well as terms including \u201ccrap,\u201d \u201chell\u201d and \u201cdamn.\u201d\n\nThe BBFC\u2019s classification adds there are also \u201cgags about \u2018beaching off\u2019 and \u2018sugar daddies.'\u201d\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s 12A rating means children under the age of 12 can still see the movie if they are accompanied by an adult.\n\nOn the same day the BBFC awarded \u201cBarbie\u201d its 12A rating, on the other side of the globe Vietnam\u2019s ministry of culture banned the film entirely after ruling the film violates the country\u2019s \u201csovereignty.\u201d The offending scene reportedly features a map with the \u201cnine dash line,\u201d representing China\u2019s territorial claims in the South China Sea."

    "text": "The multiplex is about to get Barbiefied, but the soon-to-be hit isn\u2019t the first film to feature Mattel\u2019s favorite plaything. A previous Barbie movie was made in 1987, an experimental musical biopic that barely saw the light of day. The dolls sing, and they argue, and the most famous one dies. Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story was an art school project by a mischievous but deadly earnest Bard College MFA student named Todd Haynes. Yes, before he went on to make major, Oscar-nominated films like Far From Heaven and Carol, Haynes was playing with dolls.\n\nSuperstar didn\u2019t circulate for long; Karen Carpenter\u2019s brother and bandmate, Richard, successfully sued for copyright infringement \u2013 the film features uncleared Carpenters music throughout, and he was also enraged by his portrayal in the film, since Haynes insinuates that Richard, who was married to his first cousin at the time, is gay \u2013 consigning the 43-minute creative burst to cult-curio status. But it has thrived there, with bootlegs becoming an avant-garde badge of honor. Entertainment Weekly named it one of the top 50 cult movies ever made. Today you can see blurry versions on YouTube.\n\nIt is well worth your time. Superstar remains haunting and quite moving in exploring Karen\u2019s struggle with disordered eating, and her death from heart failure at the age of 32. Haynes makes frequent use of onscreen text: \u201cWe will see how Karen\u2019s visibility as a popular singer only intensified certain difficulties many women experience in relation to their bodies.\u201d And, of course, there are the Barbies, made up and dressed for realism, serving as the perfect vessels for Haynes\u2019 vision.\n\nBart Weiss is among the film\u2019s legions of fans. The founder of Dallas VideoFest, a longtime showcase for the avant-garde and out of the ordinary, he was never able to show Superstar due to legal restrictions. But he has one of those VHS bootlegs, as well as a DVD anthology of illegal works, released by the now-defunct Stay Free! magazine, that includes the film. He believes Superstar remains worthy of study. Editor\u2019s picks\n\n\u201cThe first time you hear about it, you think, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s just going to be a spoof of Karen Carpenter,\u2019\u201d Weiss says. \u201cBut it\u2019s actually a very serious film, and the idea of using these dolls is really about the sense of perfection, which is what was really driving Karen Carpenter crazy. After about 10 minutes the novelty just sort of recedes into the background, and the foreground is incredibly powerful.\u201d\n\nDirector Todd Haynes poses with his hands folded under his chin, New York, New York, November 5, 1987. Michel Delsol/Getty Images\n\nBarbie has long been castigated for perpetuating impossible standards of physical appearance, from the pert facial features to the ridiculously slender physique (although recent iterations have brought more diversity in this regard and others). Greta Gerwig\u2019s new Barbie movie, starring Margot Robbie as the eponymous human doll, plays with this idea, casting the heroine into the real world, where all manner of imperfection lurks. But Haynes was way ahead of the curve. We see his Karen/Barbie push away food and leave boxes of laxatives laying around her room. She collapses onstage from exhaustion. Her family berates her. The filmmaker mixes in live-action footage of the Vietnam War, and talking-head commentary from fake experts, including an opinionated DJ played by Haynes himself. Trending Texas Threatens Doctors After Judge Says Woman Can Get Emergency Abortion Taylor Swift's 'Time' Cover Is Breaking Far-Right Brains Multiple Women Accuse Popular Van Life Influencer of Unwanted Sexual Behavior Nicki Minaj Reveals 'Pink Friday 2' Track List Ahead of Release\n\nHaynes was an avid student of semiotics, the systematic study of sign processes and meaning-making often used in analyzing film and literature. The Superstar Barbies are the ultimate signifiers, suggesting the artificial realm to which the film\u2019s heroine aspires. The film is also a dryly caustic send-up of the music industry, with an A&M executive, voiced by the actor Rob LaBelle (who also plays Karen and Richard\u2019s father), exclaiming his plans for The Carpenters with a coldness that only an inanimate object could conjure.\n\nIn other words, Superstar is not a comedy at all, but a sneakily subversive tragedy and an inspired wedding of form and content. The fact that you\u2019re not supposed to be able to see it only adds to the thrill. It\u2019s hard to blame anyone in Carpenter\u2019s family for wanting to suppress it, especially given the music clearance issues. But it\u2019s impossible to deny the film\u2019s resonance and its palpable sympathy for Karen Carpenter\u2019s plight. As one Barbie movie makes a box office fortune in the coming weeks, carve out a little time for its forbidden predecessor."

    "text": "Why \"Barbie\" is in hot water over the nine-dash-line\n\nDonald Rothwell is a professor of international law at Australian National University.\n\nThe new \"Barbie\" film starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is set for imminent release. But according to Vietnam's state-run Tuoi Tre newspaper, the film's release has been barred. The head of the Department of Cinema, a government body in charge of licensing and censoring foreign films, said:\n\nWe do not grant license for the American movie 'Barbie' to release in Vietnam because it contains the offending image of the nine-dash line\n\nVietnam's response to the \"Barbie\" movie's depiction of the South China Sea shows how sensitive these matters are in South East Asia, and especially in Vietnam.\n\nWhat is the nine-dash line?\n\nThe South China Sea has a long history of being contested.\n\nChina and Vietnam engaged in military clashes over the Paracel and Spratly Islands in the South China Sea in 1974 and 1988.\n\nThose disputes were over land, but more recently the focus has turned to claims over the continental shelf (the area of seabed that extends beyond the coast to at least 200 nautical miles) and the economic zones (the area at least 200 nautical miles from the coast).\n\nSince the late 1940s, China has promoted the so-called nine-dash line in the South China Sea. The line, also known as the \"U-shaped line\" or \"cow's tongue\" comprises nine dashes.\n\nAs depicted in various official and unofficial Chinese maps, the line extends off the coast of China's Hainan Island, and runs close to the coast of Vietnam, deep into the South China Sea, enclosing the Spratly Islands.\n\nNorth of Borneo, near the coasts of Malaysia and Brunei, the line turns and runs to the west of the Philippines and ends just to the south of Taiwan.\n\nThe line has long been the subject of speculation as to what exactly it purports to encompass. Is it a Chinese territorial claim? Is it a Chinese claim to a maritime space? Does it extend to sovereignty over the whole area or just to resources?\n\nChina has never been very explicit as to precisely what the claim includes but it has been persistent in seeking to advance the claim.\n\nThis has especially been the case since Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam have begun to advance their own claims to parts of the South China Sea, which overlap the nine-dash line.\n\nChina\u2019s \u201cnine-dash line\u201d demarcation gives it control of most of the South China Sea. https://t.co/7N0S4IJnGW pic.twitter.com/iPNJuaxuLC \u2014 Geopolitical Intelligence Services (@GIS_Reports) August 24, 2016\n\nWho disputes the line?\n\nA 2009 joint Malaysia/Vietnam submission to the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf highlighted competing claims over the continental shelf in the South China Sea, which is what sparked the current controversy.\n\nChina made a formal diplomatic response to the UN claiming:\n\nChina has indisputable sovereignty over the islands in the South China Sea and the adjacent waters, and enjoys indisputable sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the relevant waters as well as the seabed and subsoil thereof (see attached map).\n\nChina attached a copy of the nine-dash line map to its formal diplomatic protest to the Malaysia/Vietnam submission and added:\n\nThe above position is consistently held by the Chinese Government, and is widely known by the international community.\n\nIt turned out, however, that this was not a widely known or shared view by the international community. Since then the commission has become something of a de facto legal battleground for various views regarding the status of the nine-dash line.\n\nIn addition to China continuously advancing its position regarding the legitimacy of the nine-dash line, countries including Australia, France, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, United Kingdom and Vietnam have rebutted China's assertions.\n\nBut the commission is not a court and is comprised of scientists who assess continental shelf claims.\n\nIt was up to the Philippines, as the other nation with possible claims on the region, to separately challenge the legality of China's nine-dash line claim under the law of the sea. In 2016, a United Nations Law of the Sea Convention Tribunal ruled unanimously that China's claim had no basis in international law.\n\nThat ruling was clear-cut and conclusive, and immediately rejected by China. While the Philippines conclusively won the legal argument that the nine-dash line had no basis in modern international law or the law of the sea, China refused to respect the outcome of that case and continues to assert its South China Sea entitlements.\n\nChina does this in multiple ways. It has built artificial islands in the South China Sea, harassed foreign naval and military aircraft passing through the region, intimidated Vietnamese and other foreign fishermen, asserted rights to explore and exploit maritime oil and gas reserves, and continued to publish maps depicting the nine-dash line claim.\n\nThis is why any legitimacy given to the nine-dash line, even in Hollywood movies, is so sensitive.\n\nI spent part of the morning reply guying policy peoples questions about Vietnam banning the Barbie movie with the nine dash line map with this image of the map pic.twitter.com/oqJ91HJVUh \u2014 Lmao gan ma (@rzhongnotes) July 3, 2023\n\nWhy are maps so controversial?\n\nMaps are reflective of a critical national attribute: territory.\n\nThey define the outer limits of territorial claims. Children are familiarised with their home country by maps. Maps have historically been depicted on postage stamps, buildings and more recently, government websites.\n\nMaps now depict a country digitally and this has become contested, as highlighted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nUniversity students challenge their professors when maps are shown that depict disputed lands.\n\nMaps have meaning and touch national sensitivities.\n\nVietnam's response to Hollywood's depiction of China's nine-dash line is understandable. It demonstrates a fierce resistance to any legitimacy that China's ongoing South China Sea nine-dash line claims may generate, even in Barbie's fictional world.\n\nA spokesperson for the Warner Bros. Film Group told CBS News, \"The map in Barbie Land is a child-like crayon drawing. The doodles depict Barbie's make-believe journey from Barbie Land to the 'real world.' It was not intended to make any type of statement.\"\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license."

    "text": "Barbie is a movie that benefits from multiple screenings. On every viewing, you\u2019ll catch something different, whether it\u2019s a big idea or a tiny detail. When it hits theaters on July 21, every person who has ever dressed a Barbie up is bound to recognize some outfit or prop from their childhood, whether they played with the doll in the 1960s or 1990s. And even the Barbie agnostic will find something to pick up, whether it\u2019s references to the technicolor musicals of Old Hollywood or a famous scene from The Matrix.\n\nFilmed primarily at a studio in London, the story of Barbie begins in a pink wonderland called Barbie Land where there\u2019s an all-female Supreme Court, and, as Helen Mirren\u2019s narrator tells the audience, \u201call problems of feminism and equal rights have been solved.\u201d The Barbies celebrate their good fortune with nightly slumber parties. It\u2019s a lived-in fantasy world that relies primarily on physical sets rather than CGI. To build out Barbie Land, writer-director Greta Gerwig decided to create a coherent set of rules that would govern how it looked and functioned. In order to do that, she dove into the history of Barbie, the history of movies, and the history of fashion. For a cover story on the new film, Gerwig, producer and star Margot Robbie, and creatives at Mattel spoke to TIME about how they dreamt up all the details in the film.\n\nThe Barbie team attended a Barbie bootcamp\n\nOver the course of 2018 and 2019, Gerwig, Robbie, and folks from Robbie\u2019s production company LuckyChap went through an immersion course designed by Mattel. The unofficial Barbie bootcamp began with the doll\u2019s origin story\u2014Barbie was created by Ruth Handler\u2014and took a tour through some of Barbie\u2019s best outfits over the years.\n\nMore from TIME\n\nRead More: How Barbie Came to Life\n\nThis research served as inspiration for the story. Handler\u2019s relationship with her daughter Barbara (after whom Barbie is named) manifested as a plot point involving a mother and daughter in the film. \u201cA Barbie movie is only ever going to be a mother-daughter movie on so many levels because it was Ruth Handler and Barbara\u2014that was the relationship,\u201d says Gerwig.\n\nGerwig and filmmaker Noah Baumbach, her co-writer and partner, also had to build a world from scratch. They came up with rules for Barbie Land to keep everything coherent. \u201cYou see a seamless universe that all makes sense, and that\u2019s because there were these very specific boundaries about what could and couldn\u2019t happen,\u201d says Kate McKinnon, who plays one of the Barbies. One such rule? Barbie Land is a utopia, so nothing can be cluttered. There is no trash. \u201cNothing is dirty in the world, even when it gets its most chaotic,\u201d says McKinnon. \u201cI was struck by that.\u201d\n\nBarbie\u2019s 1950s origins inspired the Dream House aesthetic\n\nGiven that Barbie first came to market in 1959, Gerwig and Oscar-nominated production designer Sarah Greenwood decided to run with a midcentury modern aesthetic for Barbie\u2019s Dream House and many of her fashions. Barbie lives on the sort of suburban cul de sac idealized in that era.\n\nThe Dream Houses were built without walls so the actors had to be attached to wires to make sure they didn\u2019t topple off the top floors of their homes when they got out of bed. But the cast says everything else in their Dream Houses was surprisingly functional: They would sit on the retro chairs and hang out talking between takes. \u201cWe all just wanted to kick it in each other\u2019s living rooms because they were so fabulous,\u201d says Alexandra Shipp, who plays an author Barbie.\n\nRead More: Why It Took 64 Years to Make a Barbie Movie\n\nSkipper\u2019s house is the only one on the block that\u2019s purple instead of pink. Leaves are growing out of the roof, and a swing is tied to a protruding branch. Technically it is the Chelsea Tree House\u2014nearly an exact replica, scaled up to fit human actors.\n\nIn fact, everything in Barbie Land is built to a specific scale to look \u201ctoyetic.\u201d \u201cThe scale is not life-like,\u201d says Lisa McKnight, the executive vice president at Mattel whose job is specifically to oversee the marketing of Barbie and dolls. For instance, Barbie the character\u2019s Corvette is just a little too small for Robbie, just as Barbie the doll\u2019s convertible is a little too small for her: The windshield only comes up to her chest.\n\nGerwig was influenced by Old Hollywood\n\nGerwig\u2019s team didn\u2019t just study midcentury furniture trends. The filmmaker also revisited the films of Old Hollywood to capture the look of those stories. Rather than using a green screen to ensure that there were only bright blue skies in idyllic Barbie Land, Gerwig\u2019s team hand-painted the backdrops to look like old soundstage musicals. In an early scene, Ken tries to interact with a set backdrop with disastrous results.\n\nRead More: Barbie\u2019s Got a New Body\n\nMany of the props on set were also painted by hand, from the trees to the pool that sits outside of Barbie\u2019s Dream House and contains no water. \u201cI remember even the bark of the palm trees had different shades of brown, green, and even pink,\u201d says McKnight.\n\nBarbie is filled with dance numbers that are heavily influenced by 1940s and 50s Technicolor musicals like Singin\u2019 in the Rain. During filming, Robbie\u2019s production company LuckyChap hosted a film festival of sorts playing movies that influenced Barbie.\n\nBut Gerwig didn\u2019t limit herself to one era. The movie is stuffed with references to all sorts of films ranging from Rocky to 2001: A Space Odyssey to Clueless.\n\nThe devil in the tiny, pink details\n\nBarbie Land comes to life in the details. Gerwig obsessed over it all, and the props that populate the fantastical space imbue it with a surprisingly lived-in quality, like a Barbie version of the book Moby Dick on a side table. All the letters in Barbie\u2019s mailbox have been scribbled upon in a nonsense language, like a child might write.\n\nBarbie devotees know that Pantone 219 is Barbie\u2019s very specific shade of pink. A giant Pantone 219 chip sits outside the Barbie conference room at Mattel. But the set used so much pink paint\u2014in that specific color as well as secondary and tertiary shades\u2014that it precipitated a worldwide shortage. The sheer number of pinks in every shot presented their own challenge. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have seen or will ever see a film with more pink in it,\u201d says producer David Heyman, who helped build another famous fantasy world with the Harry Potter film series. \u201cAnd then how to handle that photographically\u2014thank goodness we had Rodrigo Prieto, who was able to balance all that and create a beautiful and rich palette.\u201d\n\nOut now: TIME\u2019s new special edition about Barbie is available at newsstands and here online\n\nThe soundtrack is filled with today\u2019s top artists, but even the singers were chosen with intention. Issa Rae, who plays President Barbie, points out that Barbie\u2019s image among adults has been buoyed in recent years by Nicki Minaj, who has adopted the name \u201cBarbie\u201d as one of her personas. Minaj, along with Ice Spice, are the ones remixing Aqua\u2019s old \u201cBarbie Girl\u201d song in a wink to Barbie\u2019s influence on music throughout the years. \u201cMy Barbie association is Nicki Minaj,\u201d says Rae. \u201cSo it\u2019s dope that she is a part of this movie in some way.\u201d\n\nBarbie\u2019s fashion is (almost) always on point\n\nBeyond the Barbie immersion course, Gerwig and Baumbach did their own deep dive to dig up even more details about particularly strange or controversial outfits or dolls Mattel produced over the years. Robbie\u2019s Barbie and Ryan Gosling\u2019s Ken donned collector\u2019s items that we won\u2019t spoil for superfans. And, yes, some of the stranger toys show up in the movie too. The marketing rollout has already revealed that the pregnant Midge doll who quite literally popped a baby out makes an appearance in the film. (Emerald Fennell has the honor of portraying the unusual toy.)\n\nRead More: What to Know About Midge and Allan, the Deepest Cuts From the Barbie Movie\n\nOscar-winning costume designer Jacqueline Durran was charged with replicating some of Barbie\u2019s most iconic looks. She had a direct line to Kim Culmone, the head of design for fashion dolls at Mattel, who in turn would dive deep into the archives to provide the filmmaking team with references. Every bathing suit and camp shirt was handmade and silk screened and completely custom. \u201cWhether it\u2019s 1950s ladylike attire or a Western Barbie and Ken look or the rollerblades, those looks stick out to me as really toyetic,\u201d says Culmone. \u201cAnd that was important because even though we were putting Barbie in the real world, there was always a commitment to serve the fans of Barbie with these toyetic references.\u201d\n\nBut the specific touches are what truly made the set a work of art. At one point during the movie, Ken walks around in a pair of boxing shoes that are made specifically for smooth surfaces, which is fine because there\u2019s no real grass, gravel, or dirt in Barbie Land.\n\nPhotograph by Carlota Guerrero for TIME\n\nWrite to Eliana Dockterman at eliana.dockterman@time.com."

    "text": "Even for \"Barbie\" director Greta Gerwig, negotiating a salary isn't always easy.\n\nGerwig's movie is among the most anticipated films of the summer. And while her salary has not been made public, the movie has a budget of $145 million, according to Variety. Gerwig's leading actors, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, are each making $12.5 million for the film, Variety also reported.\n\nDespite Gerwig's Hollywood success and directing accolades, though, she hasn't always been comfortable in salary negotiations, she told CNBC Make It in 2020.\n\nEven with her agent acting as an intermediary, \"I always have this sense of, 'Don't negotiate, just take whatever they'll give us,' because I'm just so scared that I won't be able to make a movie,\" she said. \"I don't want to ask for too much.\"\n\nFor that reason, she's glad to have a middleman pushing for more than she might herself.\n\nWithin the movie industry, Gerwig believes there is a need for more women directors. More movies should be made about women as well, she told Make It in 2020.\n\nOutside of Hollywood, there is also room to grow when it comes to women's salary lobbying power. Only 26% of female jobseekers negotiated their salaries, compared with 35% of male jobseekers, a 2018 survey from Jobvite found.\n\nAnd Gerwig isn't alone in her fear of asking for too much. Even when women ask for raises as much as men do, they're only successful 15% of the time, compared with men's 20%, researchers from the Harvard Business Review reported in 2018.\n\nFor many women, a major factor for a successful negotiation is knowing what you're worth and asking to be paid a fair market value. Go into the discussion with hard facts about what your peers are earning and prove why you're an asset to the company.\n\nBut for Gerwig, directing movies comes with a much different pay structure than other professions. \"Figuring out how you should be reimbursed for something and what you are worth is complicated,\" she says. How do you evaluate your value before you've even started the project?\n\nPart of the problem is a lack of transparency around pay, an issue that isn't unique to Hollywood, but certainly affects it. \"On the one hand, everything is so public \u2014 you know how much a movie is grossing and you know roughly what the cost of making it was \u2014 but everything else is so hidden, like how much people are making or what their deals are,\" Gerwig says.\n\nEventually, she sees herself working toward a compensation structure that reflects how well her movies perform, she says, like the many established directors who choose to own part of their film in place of taking a salary upfront.\n\nAs Gerwig puts it, it's \"a way to bet on yourself.\"\n\nThis is an updated version of an article originally published in February 2020.\n\nDON'T MISS: Want to be smarter and more successful with your money, work & life?

    "text": "The much-hyped release of the Barbie movie this summer has captured the attention of pop culture enthusiasts and toy lovers around the world, with the \u201cBarbiecore\u201d trend of hot-pink\u2013infused retro style infiltrating everything from fashion to gaming consoles to even Airbnb rentals. But behind this cinematic extravaganza lies a tale of reinvention and strategic prowess by Mattel, the renowned toy company.\n\nRichard Dickson, president and chief operating officer of Mattel, shed light on the struggles, triumphs, and future of the iconic Barbie brand in a conversation with Fortune at Cannes Lions\u2014the creative industry\u2019s equivalent of the Oscars.\n\nA challenging road\n\nWhile Mattel\u2019s legacy spans nearly eight decades, it hasn\u2019t all been smooth sailing for Barbie.\n\nDickson acknowledged the brand\u2019s past struggles, admitting: \u201cConsumers didn\u2019t think that she was relevant. She didn\u2019t reflect the world that kids live in.\u201d\n\nThis sentiment was reinforced by internal market research in 2014 that revealed Barbie\u2019s diminishing appeal and her inability to inspire and represent diversity. Dickson said the brand hit its lowest point in over 14 years, marking a pivotal and arduous time for Mattel.\n\n\u201cMoms were choosing other brands besides Barbie; the business itself was reflecting that,\u201d he said.\n\nReinventing Barbie\n\nTo reverse the decline, Mattel embarked on a comprehensive rebranding strategy, using a playbook which proved a springboard to many of the brand\u2019s smash-hits.\n\nDickson outlined its four key components, the first being a reevaluation of the brand\u2019s purpose. \u201cWhy do we even exist? What made us great to begin with?\u201d he said.\n\nFor Barbie, it meant reigniting her original essence of \u201cinspiring the limitless potential of girls,\u201d a vision Ruth Handler, Barbie\u2019s founder, embraced when she created the 11-and-a-half-inch doll.\n\nThe second component focuses on design-led innovation, ensuring inclusivity and representation through doll development. Mattel aimed to create dolls that mirrored the diverse world around us, including the release of its first-ever doll with Down syndrome.\n\nRemaining culturally relevant is the third pillar of the playbook, enabling Mattel to tap into the pulse of society and connect with its target audience.\n\nFinally, executing with excellence was paramount, ensuring that brilliant ideas seamlessly transition into tangible market offerings.\n\n\u201cGreat ideas are great, but if you can\u2019t bring them to market, they\u2019re nothing but great ideas,\u201d Dickson said.\n\nA glimpse into the future\n\nToday, Mattel stands on the precipice of a monumental theatrical event\u2014the release of the Barbie movie starring Hollywood A-listers Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, which proved such an enormous production effort that it sparked a global shortage of hot-pink paint.\n\nBut that turnaround has only been made possible owing to the efficacy of the playbook in practice, and Dickson proudly announced: \u201cWe hit our highest level of business ever in 2021.\u201d\n\nMattel\u2019s journey of reinvention, however, does not end here.\n\nLooking to the future, Dickson mapped out Mattel\u2019s strategic vision\u2014unlocking the value of their intellectual property, or IP.\n\nWhile Barbie takes the lead with her foray into the theatrical realm, Mattel has a lineup of 13 other brands in various stages of film development, ranging from theatrical releases to television shows, live experiences, and digital gaming.\n\nThe objective is clear: to present Mattel\u2019s cherished IP through captivating storytelling formats, thereby boosting toy sales, consumer product relevance, and impact across diverse categories.\n\nWith the Barbie movie as catalyst, it paves the way for an era of creativity and content creation at Mattel.\n\nThe company\u2019s commitment to unlocking the potential of its IP ensures that audiences can anticipate more captivating movies and experiences to come."

    "text": "It is almost impossible to escape the bright pink posters signalling the imminent release of Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie movie. The film represents the Mattel doll\u2019s first live-action film appearance and has successfully captured the cultural zeitgeist as millennials flock to post their best Barbie-inspired outfits on TikTok (videos featuring the Barbiecore hashtag have more than 570 million views).\n\nThe buzz that the film has generated is no coincidence \u2013 Mattel\u2019s Barbie division has spent $100m on marketing this year, according to Media Radar. It also marks the first major step in the company\u2019s business transformation from toy maker to an intellectual property-driven outfit.\n\nThis new vision for the business was set out by Ynon Kreiz, who became Mattel\u2019s CEO in 2018. The year prior, the company had made an operating loss of more than $339m and the bankruptcy of Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us was cited in Mattel\u2019s financial results as having had a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on its revenue. In response, Kreiz\u2019s long-term strategy shifted away from retail and towards capturing the \u201cfull value of Mattel\u2019s IP through franchise management\u201d.\n\nIn essence, Mattel set out to breathe new life into its popular roster of brands, which alongside Barbie includes Hot Wheels, Thomas & Friends and Uno. And it wants to do this by translating them to the big screen and in the process capturing a new audience.\n\nThis Barbie is a marketing machine\n\nThe idea is not revolutionary, as Sharon Price John, the current CEO of Build-A-Bear Workshop and director of Mattel\u2019s Barbie division from 1994 to 1999, notes: \u201cThe intersection of entertainment and the toy industry has been happening for years.\u201d However, a cursory glance down the list of upcoming box-office releases suggests this strategy is undergoing a resurgence.\n\nMattel alone has 45 films based on its IP in development. These include a horror-themed Magic 8 Ball movie, a \u201csurrealistic\u201d project based on the purple dinosaur Barney, a heist flick based on the game Uno and a JJ Abrams-produced Hot Wheels film. Lego is working on a third Lego movie and, following the box office success of Dungeons and Dragons, Hasbro has films based on its GI Joe, Beyblade, Monopoly, Action Man, Furby and Cluedo brands in development.\n\nBrands are realising that if they can get people to spend 90 minutes with their IP while watching a movie, it could have a really positive effect on sales\n\n\u201cThe intertwining of storytelling and toys is pretty fundamental,\u201d says John, who also worked at Hasbro in the 2000s when the business first went through a similar pivot with the release of the robot-battling blockbuster Transformers. \u201cBut one of the things that has created this recent resurgence is the decline of traditional advertising methods for toys.\u201d\n\nWhere once toy companies could reach a guaranteed audience through TV adverts during Saturday morning cartoons, younger audiences\u2019 attention is now split between video games, social media, YouTube and other video-on-demand services. \u201cThe industry seeks to create that one-to-one relationship with children and one of the few ways to continue to do that is through the creation of its own content,\u201d she adds.\n\nAnother factor influencing this trend is the growing adult market for toys. \u201cBy opening up its IP to Hollywood, Mattel is playing heavily into the strength of nostalgia among a generation of adults that used to buy its products,\u201d says Zoe Scaman, founder of brand strategy studio Bodacious, which works with businesses to open up their IP to new audiences and revenue opportunities.\n\n\u201cThese brands are realising that if they can get people to spend 90 minutes with their IP while watching a movie, it could have a really positive effect on sales.\u201d\n\nFunding a shift to films\n\nThat is not to say the shift is easy. The cost of producing a feature film with a full line-up of Hollywood A-listers, akin to Barbie, is prohibitively expensive for most companies. But there are ways to structure deals or arrange payments that can help mitigate this.\n\nMattel has launched a number of new products to coincide with the release of Barbie \u201cThe approach that different companies may take is determinant of its success as an ad tool to drive sales,\u201d John adds. \u201cThis can allow you to recoup the upfront cost on the increased margin of product sales you make as a result.\u201d Build-A-Bear Workshop released Honey Girls, a film based on its popular range of girl band-themed stuffed animals, alongside Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions in 2021. And the positive impact it\u2019s had at the checkout has been noticeable. The average transaction value at one of its retail stores is around $50, whereas for purchases that include a Honey Girls-themed product, this can rise to $100, John claims. \u201cI can only say it\u2019s a high correlation, but it would be odd if the movie release hadn\u2019t had anything to do with the fact that our dollar-per-transaction nearly doubled,\u201d she says. Nintendo has also noticed an uptick in interest in its products following the release of the The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which released in April this year. Answering questions at a recent investor call, its president Shuntaro Furukawa said: \u201cthe movie inspires interest in Mario games and has a positive effect on sales of Nintendo Switch hardware and software over the medium-to long-term.\u201d\n\nEntertainment as a marketing opportunity\n\nIt\u2019s not just toy companies that are looking to capitalise on the benefits of movie tie-ins. Earlier this year, people flocked to watch Air, which charted the rise of Nike\u2019s Air Jordan brand, and before 2023 is over, cinemagoers will be able to watch the story behind the development of Kellogg\u2019s best-selling breakfast pastry in Unfrosted: The Pop-Tart Story, as well as Eva Longoria\u2019s retelling of the creation of the \u2018Flamin\u2019 Hot\u2019 Cheetos flavour.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a proven model but it\u2019s still evolving. People are now seeing entertainment as a marketing opportunity, rather than just another path to revenue,\u201d John says. \u201cThis means we\u2019re going to see more brands use this strategy to bring their characters and stories to life.\u201d\n\nThe push for more brand-based movies is also coming from Hollywood studios. Although interesting corporate stories have been given the big-screen treatment before, from The Founder to Steve Jobs and The Social Network, there has been a glut of them this year, with Tetris, BlackBerry and Flamin\u2019 Hot all released in 2023.\n\nShawn Robbins, chief analyst at Boxoffice Pro, comments: \u201cNostalgia and brand familiarity have been major selling points throughout media and entertainment for some time. That represents a perfect crossroad when it comes to the business of Hollywood, where studios are typically risk averse. Any property with built-in awareness will be of automatic interest to them.\u201d\n\nFilms based on existing IP carry another perk for Hollywood studios, which are increasingly having to work on tight budgets. \u201cThe brands are often willing to push the film and market the shit out of it, as we\u2019ve seen with Barbie and Mattel,\u201d Scaman says. \u201cThis makes it a lower risk option with a potentially much higher reward.\u201d\n\nCan any IP be turned into a film?\n\nWith a projected $110m US opening, it\u2019s likely that many brands will be looking to dust off their dormant IP in the hope of replicating the success of Barbie. But this does not make it a suitable marketing opportunity for every business. \u201cAny IP can be turned into a film, but not any IP can be turned into a good film,\u201d John notes.\n\nSo, what should companies consider in order to make the strategy a success. John advises business leaders to ask whether their brand is truly beloved, whether it has a following and whether there is a pre-existing story arch. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t weave a story around a product that\u2019s beloved,\u201d she adds. \u201cI think Lego did a great job of that.\u201d\n\nAny IP can be turned into a film, but not any IP can be turned into a good film\n\nShe also advises companies to keep in mind their intentions: does creating a critically acclaimed film actually matter or is it more important to improve awareness and unit sales of any associated products? \u201cI believe in it as a strategy because storytelling and intellectual property have tremendous value. It should be seen as another facet of any brand that has a high emotional connection with its customers.\u201d\n\nFor Robbins, the lessons are the same for an IP-based film as with any other. \u201cTreat the audience with respect. Moviegoers will not rush out to continuously support something just because of the brand\u2026 There has to be a human connection with the characters and the story, or any initial box office success might be short-lived,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s a tightrope walk.\u201d\n\nAlthough Mattel appears to have struck gold by reimagining its Barbie brand for a millennial audience, not all CEOs should see the movie tie-in as the route to their own Malibu Dreamhouse. \u201cYou\u2019ve only got one chance to do this,\u201d Scaman says. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t go well, it can be a disaster.\u201d"

I, I guess Venice Beach was an interesting experience because it was the first time that we had Ken and Barbie in public. Yeah, we had been in *** very safe bubble with uh in Barbie Land and then we were out in the real world, they just rip the band aid off real fast do in head first. Uh There's one bit of choreography in that dance where Scott Evans has to pick me up on his shoulder and, and then I have to like do this back bend and it took us *** little while to get that right. That was um yeah, but we got there in Ryan doesn't mess up anything. Iii I can see *** lot of things that actually made the cut that I would, I would consider an accident on my but I uh I won't point them out as long as you don't notice them. No, it was so hard to find uh Cops for Ken. He was quite his uh just uh an anomaly *** little bit the way he was written. And so, uh I don't think there was any, any of that. I feel like that the, the move was very n sync or five when we do like this move to the front that felt very boy band to me. Yeah. You find that. How does the move go again? What, what move? You know, it it but articulated *** little more strongly. It was Will Ferrell in it. Yeah. Wedding crashes of stepbrothers or um for me, Lord of the Rings. Parts of the Caribbean, the fifth element Snatch. I could go on the notebook. True. It is true. But I have to turn it off at some point before it gets to the first half. Well, I'm *** huge fan of Gavin and Stacey. So Rob Rid and being and it was um you know, an enormous priority for me. Um I'm also *** huge fan of Love Island. So, yeah, the the cameos and the, the John Cena cameo was *** brilliant coincidence. He was in London shooting *** different movie and I was having dinner and when I went to pay the bill, the waiter was like uh it's already been taken care of and I was like, what by who? And they were like by John Cena and I was like, where's John Cena right now because I've worked with him before. He was over in the corner. And I was like, what are you doing here? He said, oh, I'm working on this and I was like, oh, we're shooting at leaves in as well, come be in there, man. And he was like, ok, you needed. The slide is as president. Well, that's obvious. Yeah, that was the, that's what I meant to say. The slide was so fun because it was actually *** bit dangerous. You had to, you had to have *** and Roy, our stunt coordinator had to, you know, help out. You couldn't just go down the willy nilly. That was the whole thing. Um When I was little, uh I wanted to own hotels and be *** magician. So, and then when I got *** bit older, I thought I'm gonna plan music festivals. I'm gonna organize music festivals. I'd probably be *** valet at one of Margo's hotels or *** roadie at one of these music festivals. How, how are you? Thanks. There's so much to take away from the film, but I think it's more than anything. It's just so much fun and it's, we've been having fun making it and it's exciting to see uh people now having the same experience, but you probably have *** more nuance to answer than that. No, I was, I was gonna say dance moves in particular. No. You know which one I want them to take away. This one you do like that. The body roll, the body roll with the, the hand comes around. It's my favorite.\n\nGET LOCAL BREAKING NEWS ALERTS The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. Your Email Address Submit Privacy Notice"

    "text": "Valentino, Paris Fashion Week A/W 22\n\nJul 09, 2023 By WGSN Insider\n\nDiscover why retailers should look beyond the social trend and plan with lighter pink tones for longevity, even though #HyperPink hues are trending on social media.\n\nHyper brights / WGSN Streets\n\nWith the upcoming Barbie movie premiere this month, the recently released trailer has triggered another social media surge of pinks. Brands are tapping into the craze with #Barbiecore styling in stores, windows, social content and digital merchandising. However, data from WGSN Fashion indicates that this trend has peaked commercially with it performing below average.\n\nThe evolution of Hyper Pink\n\nWGSN first forecast the Hyper Pink trend in 2018. In 2020, we announced Orchid Flower as the 2022 Colour of the Year. The demand for products has been high ever since, and through WGSN\u2019s data forecast, we saw early indicators that #BarbiePink was gaining traction in all regions.\n\nWGSN first highlighted Hyper Pink as a trend at the S/S 19 London Fashion Week\n\nIn the short term, we expect #HyperPink hues to trend on social deeper into the summer, in line with the release of the Barbie movie on the 21st of July. Google searches show \u201cBarbie pink\u201d gaining interest again. Our Women\u2019s Spring analysis report also notes that mentions of \u201cBarbie pink\u201d on social media grew 21% YoY.\n\nMentions of Barbie pink peaked on social media in October 2022 and spiked again in April 2023 when the Barbie trailer was released / Source: WGSN, February \u2013 April 2023 and 2022\n\nDespite the social buzz, sales momentum slows for Hyper Pink\n\nWGSN e-commerce data shows that Barbie pink products are performing below average. The hyper-bright era is on the wane as a more sombre mood took hold following the post-pandemic euphoria, which saw hyper-brights have their moment.\n\nKoche, Paris Fashion Week Spring/Summer 23\n\nAt WGSN, we collect and classify product data from major global e-commerce sites, including product descriptions, price, promotions and availability, enabling us to assess the strength of trends over time.\n\nWe see that retailers have been increasing the amount of bright pink products this summer by 1pp compared with last year, however more of these products are being discounted than the apparel average, with only 9% of them going out-of-stock at full price (vs a 13% apparel average). Categories where bright pinks are performing are jumpsuits, trousers and sleepwear.\n\nWGSN / Fashion Week Streets\n\nGoing forward, retailers should pull back bright pink volumes and take a tactical category and item approach to discounting what they have, in order to protect margins.\n\nWith WGSN data, we are able to capture trends ahead of big cultural shifts and consumer conversations such as the Barbie movie, and help figure out the next move for your business. To get a more in-depth pink colour forecast, talk to our team to get full access to WGSN data insights."

    "text": "Mark Ronson is showing off his Barbies.\n\nScattered throughout his studio, the executive producer of the \u201cBarbie\u201d soundtrack \u2014 and a musical polymath known for his work with artists like Amy Winehouse and Lady Gaga \u2014 has a few \u201cleftovers\u201d scattered across the room. One doll is placed in a permanent split, stretched across a Moog synthesizer. Another is styled to look like primatologist Jane Goodall.\n\n\u201cI went to Toys R Us and I couldn\u2019t find a single Ken,\u201d he laughs. Fittingly, \u201cthat\u2019s the theme of the movie.\u201d Mattel HQ did end up sending over a few; the Ken that remains in Ronson\u2019s studio is, appropriately, shirtless.\n\nFinding the sound of \u201cBarbie,\u201d poised to become one of 2023\u2019s biggest blockbusters, required careful consideration and research for a film with such a rich visual palette. In the end, he produced a stacked soundtrack that included Lizzo, Billie Eilish, Dua Lipa (who also acts in the movie) and more.\n\nBut it started with a simple text message.\n\nThe music supervisor on the project, George Drakoulias, shot Ronson a quick, \u201cBarbie?\u201d Ronson read the script and was in. He also scored \u201cBarbie\u201d with collaborator Andrew Wyatt. Ronson is no stranger to working on music for film, but executive producing a soundtrack album and scoring an entire movie, let alone, a movie of this size, was new territory. \u201cIt was a lot of learning on the job,\u201d he says.\n\nThe soundtrack assignment began with two tracks: a pop song for a big dance number and an \u201980s power ballad for Ken (name a genre with more \u201cself-aware, bombastic silliness,\u201d as Ronson calls it).\n\nThe former came first. Ronson came up with a chorus and beat \u2014 a detour from his first, far too obvious plan on writing \u201c\u201980s, sugar-y pop,\u201d and instead landing on a \u201cgroovy, melodic thing \u2026 with some toughness,\u201d perfect for Dua Lipa. It became \u201cDance the Night,\u201d the Lipa track featured in the film\u2019s main trailer.\n\nThe Ken song came about differently. For the most part, Ronson works on instrumentals: When he wrote \u201cShallow\u201d with Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper for \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d for example, he only contributed lyrics to fill in gaps \u2014 the \u201csurface, don\u2019t hurt us,\u201d line, as he recalls. But for the song that would become Ryan Gosling\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Just Ken,\u201d Ronson couldn\u2019t shake the lyric: \u201cI\u2019m just Ken, anywhere else I\u2019d be a 10.\u201d\n\nSo he sent director Greta Gerwig a demo with a few lines \u2014 including a deliciously mouthy lyric about \u201cblonde fragility.\u201d She sent it to Gosling, who plays Ken in the film, and knew immediately he needed to sing it. What could have soundtracked any scene in the film became its own musical moment.\n\nEarly on, Gerwig used the Bee Gees and \u201970s discos as a reference point for Ronson.\n\n\u201cYou know the Chicago (Disco Demolition) thing, where everyone burned their disco records, \u201cSaturday Night Fever\u201d had reached its apex and the poor Bee Gees were like, \u2018All we wanted to do was make people dance! What did we do wrong?\u2019\u201d says Ronson. \u201cThat\u2019s \u2018Barbie.\u2019\u201d\n\nIf anything, that idea is more of a thematic one than a sonic guideline. The mood board was vast, and also included \u201cDolly Parton, Olivia Newton John, \u2018Nine to Five,\u2019\u201d Ronson explains.\n\nIt speaks to why the \u201cBarbie\u201d soundtrack spans pop genres, including a reggaeton track courtesy of Karol G, \u201cWatati,\u201d bubblegum K-pop from girl group Fifty Fifty featuring Kaliii in \u201cBarbie Dreams,\u201d and the falsetto-led piano ballad \u201cWhat Was I Made For?\u201d by Billie Eilish.\n\nFor Atlantic Records, who released the soundtrack, collaboration and diversity was key.\n\n\u201cAll of these artists were brought in early on to do screenings with Mark, Greta, and the filmmakers. They would see scenes they were going to write their music to,\u201d says Brandon Davis, executive vice president and co-head of pop A&R at the label. \u201cEach of these artists wrote lyrics about the specific ways Barbie was important to them.\u201d\n\nRonson echoes the sentiment.\n\n\u201cKarol G was like, \u2018I\u2019m here because I love Barbie. I wasn\u2019t expecting this incredible film. This is awesome,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cAnd HAIM had this encyclopedic knowledge. The only VHS they were allowed in the \u201990s, when they were kids, was this one Barbie thing. They knew every song.\u201d\n\nOthers were tasked with a prompt: Lizzo\u2019s \u201cPink\u201d, which ends with a voiceover from Helen Mirren, was inspired by the lead Barbie, played by Margot Robbie, living through her perfect day. And because the film is a comedy with real-world complications, humor informed a lot of the songwriting: It\u2019s in Dominic Fike\u2019s \u201cHey Blondie\u201d as well as the many samples of Charli XCX\u2019s \u201cSpeed Drive.\u201d\n\n\u201c(Soundtracks) are an area where we cracked the code and figured out how to make it work in a way where we support our partners creatively,\u201d says Kevin Weaver, president of Atlantic Records West Coast, citing Atlantic\u2019s work on other major soundtracks like from the \u201cFast & Furious\u201d franchise, \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars,\u201d and \u201c The Greatest Showman,\u201d which produced massive hits like Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth\u2019s \u201cSee You Again,\u201d Charli XCX\u2019s \u201cBoom Clap,\u201d and \u201cThis Is Me,\u201d respectively.\n\nBut unlike those films, part of the acquisition process for \u201cBarbie\u201d required a trip to the doll factory, where Atlantic executives got to witness the doll-making process from inception to completion. (Davis and Weaver are both producers on the soundtrack.)\n\nWhen working with legendary intellectual property, a soundtrack comes with some risks. Do you bring back Aqua\u2019s 1997 hit \u201cBarbie Girl,\u201d or do you reimagine it? Surely Nicki Minaj must be featured \u2014 her fans are called Barbz.\n\n\u201cI remember \u2014 no offense \u2014 that I had a song on the \u201cGhostbusters\u201d remake and I think six of the 12 songs were reinterpretations of Ray Parker Jr.(\u2019s \u201cGhostbusters\u201d theme),\u201d says Ronson. \u201cIt all dovetailed into the single we have with Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice,\u201d he continued, referencing the reworking of \u201cBarbie Girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never really executive produced something before,\u201d Ronson says. \u201cI love this film. We had an amazing partner in Atlantic Records.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then doing the score, but it was a lot of learning on the job. It was still a job that I\u2019ve never really done before. \u2026 It\u2019s fun to show people different scenes and getting them to dream big.\u201d"

The review criticized the film about the iconic doll of abandoning its core audience of families and little girls to instead focus on LGBTQ stories.\n\n\"The new BARBIE movie forgets its core audience of families and children while catering to nostalgic adults and pushing lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender character stories. Furthermore, the movie was poorly made with multiple premises, losing even the most die-hard fans,\" the scathing staff review-penned piece began.\n\n\"They had a built-in market and audience for this franchise that they completely ignored,\" the story continued. \"Millions of families would have turned out to the theaters and purchased tickets, but instead, Mattel chose to cater to a small percentage of the population who has proven over and over to abandon the box office.\"\n\nOSCAR-WINNING SCREENWRITER LEFT FAILED SONY \u2018BARBIE\u2019 MOVIE BECAUSE STUDIO WANTED \u2018GIRL-BOSS FEMINIST TWIST'\n\nHowever actress Margot Robbie defended the film in a recent interview, saying it was \"literally crafted to be for everyone.\"\n\n\"This is such a thing people say when they do press for a movie. They\u2019re like, \u2018It\u2019s for everyone.\u2019 But it was literally crafted to be for everyone,\" Robbie said after being asked if the film was made for kids. Director Greta Gerwig crafted humor aimed at children and adults, the film's star further explained.\n\nHowever, members of the cast and crew have praised the film's left-leaning messages on gender in media interviews.\n\n\"It most certainly is a feminist film,\" Gerwig said to ABC News Australia. \"It's feminist in a way that includes everyone,\" she elaborated.\n\nBARBIE STAR SAYS FILM TESTS \u2018HETERONORMATIVE\u2019 IDEA OF GENDER, OFFERS \u2018SCATHING CRITIQUES\u2019 OF ICONIC DOLL\n\nTransgender actor Hari Nef, who plays a \"Doctor Barbie\" told Out Magazine that the film had an empowering message about being transgender.\n\n\"As much as there\u2019s a celebration of femininity and being a girl in this [movie], I think there\u2019s also an encouragement of letting go of the checklist we ascribe to living and living your life and being in your body your way, on your own terms,\" Nef said.\n\nStar Simu Liu has also praised the film for deconstructing \"heteronormative\" gender roles about toys and colors.\n\n\"And I\u2019m so glad that this movie exists because I think it puts the final nail in the coffin of that very heteronormative idea of what gender is, and what is or is not gendered,\" he said during an interview with Screen Rant\u2019s Joe Deckelmeier.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile discussing the film's feminist themes with Fandango, actress and \"Saturday Night Live\" alum Kate McKinnon revealed she knew she wanted to be in the film after reading about how the script deconstructs gender roles.\n\n\"I knew it was going to be something and then I read it, and it was like, sort of about how like gender roles deny people half their humanity and how like we need to just like be ourselves,\" McKinnon said.\n\nCo-star Issa Rae praised the film for sidelining Barbie's male counterpart, \"Ken\", to be an \"accessory\" for Barbie.\n\nRae told interview host Naz Perez, \"I think a Ken for me is just kind of there. I think a Ken is just a great accessory. That\u2019s what I loved about Greta\u2019s imagining of Barbie is that the Kens are just supplemental characters to these Barbies.\"\n\nWarner Bros.

    "text": "Hari Nef \u2014 the trans actress from Philadelphia \u2014 plays one of the Barbies in Greta Gerwig's new film about the doll starring Margot Robbie. But conservatives are angry about Nef's role. Read more\n\nOn the heels of its premiere, Greta Gerwig\u2019s highly anticipated Barbie film is already drawing criticism from some conservative crowds. And at the center of those critics\u2019 disapproval is Philly-born actress Hari Nef.\n\nIn Barbie, a string of Barbies and Kens live in Barbieland and share the same names. Each Barbie and Ken takes on a different personality and role. The main Barbie is played by Margot Robbie and the main Ken by Ryan Gosling. But other notable actors playing the respective dolls include Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Dua Lipa, Simu Liu, and John Cena.\n\nNef, who is known for her roles in And Just Like That... and Transparent and was the first trans woman signed by IMG Models, plays one of the Barbies. Nef\u2019s inclusion and some of the feminist themes in Gerwig\u2019s Barbie have been praised as a diverse and empowering portrayal of the iconic doll. But far-right personalities and commentators see it differently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Philly-born transgender model is breaking down fashion barriers\n\nLast week, a review by the Christian site Movieguide slammed the film for including queer talent.\n\n\u201cThe new Barbie movie forgets its core audience of families and children while catering to nostalgic adults and pushing lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender character stories,\u201d read the article \u2014 which is titled \u201cWARNING: Don\u2019t Take Your Daughter to Barbie.\u201d Fox News has since quoted the review.\n\nGinger Gaetz, the wife of U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R., Fla.) criticized the film after attending its premiere this week, saying that it \u201cunfortunately neglects to address any notion of faith or family.\u201d She went on to call Ken\u2019s portrayal \u201cdisappointingly low T\u201d \u2014 suggesting low testosterone levels \u2014 and a \u201cbeta\u201d male, not an alpha.\n\nAs noted by the LGBTQ+ digital magazine, them, a video of a pastor condemning Barbie for being full of \u201ctranssexual and transgender homosexuality\u201d went viral online.\n\nRight-wing commentators Charlie Kirk and Ben Shapiro both slammed Nef\u2019s casting ahead of the film\u2019s release.\n\nStill, those involved with the making of Barbie say fearmongering over a \u201ctrans Barbie\u201d is just that.\n\nIn an interview with Attitude, Robbie confirmed the dolls don\u2019t have sexualities \u2014 because, well, they\u2019re dolls.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t actually have sexual orientations because they don\u2019t have reproductive organs,\u201d she said. Still, when casting, Robbie \u2014 who is also one of the movie\u2019s producers \u2014 and Gerwig wanted to make sure Barbieland was inclusive. \u201cIt was so important that every person that was coming aboard the party would be able to represent someone else that could be watching this movie.\u201d\n\nAlong with Nef, other LGBTQ+ cast members include Kate McKinnon, Alexandra Shipp, and Scott Evans.\n\nIn an interview with Out, Nef said she wasn\u2019t cast because she was trans \u2014 adding that the film\u2019s executive producer said he didn\u2019t know Nef was trans in the first place.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Why is \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 having such a cultural moment?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably positive for Mattel to include me in this because we\u2019re trying to show all different kinds of Barbies, but that\u2019s not why I got the role,\u201d she said. \u201cI got the role because I fit the role. To be honest, I don\u2019t look much different in the movie than the Barbies that I had when I was a kid.\u201d\n\nStill, Out reported that the movie has a strong message for trans women about \u201cthe beauty of being a person rather than an ideal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think as a trans girl, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in big dreams of what you\u2019ll become. And it\u2019s inevitable that you\u2019ll get struck down by external messages and obstacles of what you\u2019ll never be and what you won\u2019t be able to do. You\u2019re caught constantly between striving for perfection and recoiling from rejection. It\u2019s hard,\u201d Nef said.\n\n\u201cAs much as there\u2019s a celebration of femininity and being a girl in this [movie], I think there\u2019s also an encouragement of letting go of the checklist we ascribe to living and living your life and being in your body your way, on your own terms,\u201d she said. \u201cThe best that we can do as women, as trans women, is be there for each other and take ourselves at face value, without relying on the green light from someone or anyone else.\u201d\n\nDespite the anti-Barbie wave and a hashtag to #BoycottBarbie (which has gained little traction), Barbie is expected to bring in an estimated $95 to $105 million opening weekend, Variety reports."

    "text": "LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - JULY 09: (L-R) Ryan Gosling, America Ferrera, Ariana Greenblatt, Issa Rae, Margot Robbie, Greta Gerwig, Simu Liu and Hari Nef attend the World Premiere of \"Barbie\" at Shrine Auditorium and Expo Hall on July 09, 2023 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Rodin Eckenroth/WireImage)\n\nBarbie is one of the most highly-anticipated movies of the summer! The film about America\u2019s favorite plastic doll hits theaters on July 21st with Oscar-nominated actress Margot Robbie stepping into the heels of the iconic doll, while fellow Oscar-nominated actor Ryan Gosling portrays Barbie\u2019s boyfriend Ken.\n\nAside from Robbie and Gosling, the film has an all-star cast that includes Issa Rae, America Ferrera, Kate McKinnon, Michael Cera, and Simu Liu. The cast has been busy doing promotional tours for the upcoming release and sharing secrets about production and having fun filming the movie, but they didn\u2019t let the fun stop after the cameras stopped rolling.\n\nThe Barbie cast bonded during sleepovers and pink days while on set\n\nThe Barbie film has been gaining a lot of buzz as fans eagerly await to see the fun adventures of Barbie, Ken, and their friends. The making of the film was a fun experience for the cast, who became fast friends.\n\nIn an interview with People, the group revealed how they bonded when they were away from the set. Before filming started, Robbie hosted a sleepover with the other actors, according to Liu.\n\n\u201cMargot was so great. She had a sleepover with the Barbies before photography started, and the Kens were allowed to either visit briefly or to phone in and say hi.\u201d\n\nAside from sleepovers, the cast also attended movie nights at Robbie\u2019s house. The actress made sure her co-stars had a fun time and found a unique way for them to raise money for charity. According to Gosling, Robbie implemented pink days to help raise money for a good cause.\n\n\u201cMargot had this pink day once a week, where everyone had to wear something pink. And if you didn\u2019t, you were fined. She would go around collecting the fines, and she would donate it to a charity.\u201d\n\nGosling revealed that the crew also got in on the action with the pink dress code.\n\n\u201cWhat was really special was just how excited the male crew members were. At the end of the film, they all got together and, with their own money, made pink crew shirts with rainbow fringe. It was this opportunity for them to show their respect and admiration for what Margot and Greta Gerwig were creating.\u201d\n\nLooks like the project was a fun experience for both the cast and crew. Fans will get to see the final product when Barbie premieres in theaters nationwide on July 21, 2023.\n\nAre you excited for the film?

There\u2019s also a line of \u201cBarbie the Movie\u201d dolls. (So far, no such line for \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d)\n\nGet The Big To-Do Your guide to staying entertained, from live shows and outdoor fun to the newest in museums, movies, TV, books, dining, and more. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAs intense as \u201cBarbie\u201d marketing has been, the movie\u2019s strongest selling point is also its simplest: brand awareness. Love her or hate her (for many of us, it\u2019s more complicated than that), you know her. And even if you never coveted her in a toy store aisle, or cut her hair, or carted her and her friends off to some yard sale in the sky, you probably know someone who has.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1959 Teenage Fashion Model Barbie doll Mattel\n\nWe asked our newsroom colleagues to share their experiences over the years with the Barbie brand \u2014 and received stories about Ken (a.k.a. \u201cjust Ken\u201d), Christie (the first Black \u201cBarbie\u201d doll, debuted in 1968), a beloved Barbie sports car, and more.\n\n\u2014 BROOKE HAUSER AND ODIE HENDERSON\n\nThe \"Christie\" doll from 1969 Mattel\n\nMy Barbie was Christie growing up in the early 2000s. Every time I played with Christie, I made her exactly like my cool older sister, but with a career as a world-renowned fashion designer. My mom would let me cut up socks and doll clothes so that I could make the outfits in my imagination come to life. Although my designs never turned out great, I will never forget being able to live out my dream job as a kid through my favorite doll \u2014 who also looked like me and every woman around me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014 ADRIA WATSON\n\n1979 Barbie and Ken dolls Mattel\n\nPoor Ken. In Barbie\u2019s world, he ranked between \u201cleft shoe\u201d and \u201cpool slide\u201d as her most important accessory. He had no dream house or car and was saddled with a wardrobe straight out of the International Male catalog.\n\nBut I\u2019m happy to say that in my childhood home, in the 1970s, Ken found status, meaning, and love. He made his way from my sister\u2019s Barbie collection into the welcoming embrace of my G.I. Joe action figure.\n\nJoe, who had recently redecorated his camper (with my help) after an extended tour in Vietnam, was looking to share his abode on wheels with a new pal. Ken was more than happy for the companionship. They made a beautiful couple. Their adventures in my backyard included picking raspberries from the overgrown briar patch to make coulis for their cheesecake and gossiping about Barbie\u2019s poor taste in satin jumpsuits.\n\nThey shared everything, even the single bed in Joe\u2019s camper. Thankfully my sister never noticed Ken\u2019s mysterious disappearance from her toy chest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014 CHRISTOPHER MUTHER\n\n1978 Country Camper Barbie vehicle Mattel\n\nWhen I was growing up in the \u201890s in Karachi, Pakistan, Barbie was the elite toy my uncle brought me and my cousins from America. Once I moved to Canada a few years later, I could pick out my favorites from the store myself: Cool Clips Barbie had super-long hair and pink and blue color-changing hair clips I could put in my own hair, too.\n\nOther faves were an Indian Barbie in a sari; two princess Barbies (accidentally bought a duplicate) where one was the evil twin because I messed up her hair; and another Barbie that came with a cat that could pee in a litter box. My beloved dolls are still stored in a large bin at my parents\u2019 house. Its blue lid hasn\u2019t served as a pool in nearly two decades.\n\n\u2014 SAHAR FATIMA\n\nA miniature VIP ticket that came with one Barbie doll is an example of the extremely tiny accessories that often accompany the popular toys \u2014 and get easily lost. Steve Annear\n\nI\u2019d mostly avoided Barbie interactions for 38 years, having grown up in a household in the 1980s and \u203290s with two boys who loved \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\u201d and \u201cGhostbusters.\u201d But now that I have a 5-year-old daughter, who has become enamored of the dolls after they were gifted to her one birthday, there is a large pink house inside my tiny apartment that takes up most of our living room. There are also Barbies lying half-clothed in the tub, and Barbies spilling out of a basket now affectionately known as the Barbie Basket.\n\nMy Barbie voice during playtime is high-pitched and subpar, and my patience for locating the teeny-tiny accessories \u2014 a VIP ticket the size of a tick; rogue sneakers and little pet turtles; a minuscule chalk bag for Sport Climbing Barbie \u2014 when my daughter loses them is waning. Luckily, she also likes Ninja Turtles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014 STEVE ANNEAR\n\n1962 Barbie Dreamhouse Mattel\n\nI didn\u2019t really have Barbies growing up. My older sister had one \u2014 \u201cKissing Barbie,\u201d with a button on her back you could push to make smooching noises \u2014 but my doll of choice was Strawberry Shortcake. I was (and am!) more interested in cakes and pies than bust measurements and clothes, and Strawberry Shortcake dolls also came with animal familiars, which was a draw for me.\n\nI did play with Kissing Barbie because our stock of dolls was limited (toys were a lot more expensive in the \u203280s), but she always looked extremely out of place in our shoebox dollhouse with her weeny outfits. A lot of our play plotlines involved making Barbie the scapegoat for everything that went wrong, or casting her as an airhead, or marrying her to Strawberry Shortcake\u2019s evil nemesis, the Purple Pieman. I don\u2019t think I ever thought of her as a standard of beauty \u2014 blond, for some unfair reason, was synonymous with stupidity to us, and being smart was important in our family.\n\n\u2014 FRANCIE LIN\n\n1978 Ken doll Mattel\n\nIn 1978 I was living my best 5-year-old life, peacefully at play with Matchbox cars \u2014 until Barbie busted into my life in a riot of pink.\n\nOur neighbor\u2019s Dreamhouse became my obsession. Mom noticed and tried to curb my interest. Traditional gender roles and aggressive masculinity were tenets of family life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuying Ken was her wish for me to be bullied less. Instead he became my ticket into the Dreamhouse, where I abandoned him for Barbie.\n\n\u2014 OMAR VEGA\n\nFrom left: Kingsley Ben-Adir as Ken, Ryan Gosling as Ken, and Ncuti Gatwa as Ken in Warner Bros. Pictures\u2019 \u201cBarbie.\" Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nI recall feeling a sense of pride around not typically playing with Barbie dolls as a child. With an older brother and mostly male friends, I\u2019d always wanted to be \u201cone of the boys,\u201d hence my rejection of the feminine toy. But now, in adulthood, I find myself eager for the release of the \u201cBarbie\u201d movie in all its hot-pink frivolousness. I am a child of the early 2000s, so Barbie is my birthright, and I can\u2019t wait to shamelessly, finally, unwrap her.\n\n\u2014 DANA GERBER\n\nMargot Robbie as Barbie in Warner Bros. Pictures\u2019 \"Barbie.\" Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nBarbie was not part of my childhood in the 1970s. However, she\u2019s part of my life now. I played Drag Queen Bingo at New York\u2019s Stonewall Inn a few Mondays ago. I won a round! The drag queen mocked my film critic job \u2014 \u201dyour mother must be so proud!\u201d \u2014 and my prize was a Disney Princess Barbie. I chose Princess Tiana, because her movie has a character named Mama Odie. I never win anything, so I\u2019m keeping this doll!\n\n\u2014 ODIE HENDERSON\n\nAshlee Korlach drives a pink Barbie Corvette around a cul-de-sac as her father watches. Ashlee Korlach\n\nWhen I was the perfect age to drive a bright pink, toddler-sized Barbie Corvette, I was a Barbie girl through and through, cruising the cul-de-sac in style. There would be many dolls after them, but Barbies were the first dolls my sister and I had in the late \u201890s/early 2000s. I\u2019ve gone through phases since then \u2014 like resenting Barbie, as a budding feminist \u2014 but I\u2019ve come back to loving all things Barbie as I await the movie.\n\n\u2014 ASHLEE KORLACH\n\n1980 Black Barbie Mattel\n\nOne of my early Barbie dolls was her friend Christie. She was Black, like me, but she was an adult who was long-legged, shapely, and glamorous. Christie had on a gown that Diana Ross or Donna Summer would wear and big \u203270s feathered hair with a cool blond streak. I wanted to be Christie because she personified all the elegant and beautiful Black women I emulated.\n\nSoon, I began to request Barbie dolls with careers that inspired me. I had a ballerina Barbie, a doctor Barbie, and a Day-to-Night Barbie. I also owned several Barbies who represented expansive diversity and beauty ideals that followed the trends of the times: Black Barbie (the very first \u201cBlack\u201d Barbie doll with the Barbie name, released in 1980), the winking Western Barbie, and Magic Curl Barbie, whose hair went from curly afro to straight with the aid of a magic mist straightening powder.\n\nI also owned many of her accessories that completed the promise of her fabulous adult life: her three-story townhouse, pink Corvette, pool, and Golden Palomino horse named Dallas. I saw my dolls going places and accomplishing big goals. Barbie was the mini-me \u2014 the me who was still yet to be.\n\nToday, I still \u201cplay\u201d with Barbie, only now I\u2019m a doll collector. I purchase many of the limited-edition Barbie dolls, and I am also buying back the older, vintage Barbie dolls I had in my youth. After all these years, I still love Barbie.\n\n\u2014 RONKE IDOWU REEVES\n\nThe box for a 1997 Happy Holidays Barbie that remains unopened. Marie Piard\n\nI played with Barbie during the 1990s and was obsessed with all things Mattel. The doll aisle at Toys \u201cR\u201d Us was my fortress. I had her Jeep, Corvette, and Dreamhouse (I was that girl). In 1997, as a gift from Mom, I got a Happy Holidays Barbie. She was too perfect. Even as a kid, I knew it would one day be very special, so I did the impossible: I never opened the box. To calm my excitement about having her, I slit open a small section of the back panel so I could feel the red and gold dress with my pinky. I still have the mostly unopened box.\n\n\u2014 MARIE PIARD\n\nNews Anchor Barbie poses in front of the linotype in the lobby of The Boston Globe, ready for a day of reporting with her microphone. Karissa Korman for The Boston Globe\n\nMy Slack picture is and has been a 60th-anniversary journalist Barbie. I have her at my desk. News Anchor Barbie came with a small microphone, heels, and a blue statement necklace (all things journalists need, clearly). I bought her as well as a tiny pink laptop, tiny pink iPhone, and tiny pink iPad. She also has a small Starbucks drink.\n\n\u2014 MADDIE MORTELL\n\n1961 Austin Healey Barbie car Mattel\n\nI pulled the dolls one by one from the box \u2014 festive, holiday Barbies to celebrate Christmas and New Year\u2019s Eve. Their gleaming faces were the idols of my childhood in the 1990s, early lessons in makeup and beauty. Constructing their lives became foundational for my love of narrative, a first foray into theater. Barbies cemented a decades-long friendship with the girl who lived down the street.\n\nI held one out to my 5-year-old daughter, expectation and joy in the palm of my hand.\n\nShe eyed it warily.\n\n\u201cNo thanks,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2014 JESSICA BARTLETT"

He also knew he didn\u2019t want to propose in front of a typical landmark. He wanted a spot that felt iconic but unique, a place that felt like the Washington they knew, not the Washington that was known.\n\nThat\u2019s how the two ended up standing in front of a house on Q Street in Northwest D.C. one evening last year, looking at the latest display in the Barbie Pond.\n\nDuring the early days of the pandemic, the couple had walked by the garden-sized body of water and seen Barbie and her crew posed in all sorts of ways that reflected current events, holidays and movies. In April 2020, two dolls in boxing gloves stood in a ring fighting the coronavirus. In October of that year, zombie-appearing dolls lurked in that space. A month later, dolls resembling President Biden and Vice President Harris stood against a backdrop of the White House surrounded by Barbies holding signs that indicated they had voted.\n\nOn the day Looney planned to propose, he and Benjamin walked from their home in Dupont Circle to the restaurant Le Diplomate. After they finished dinner, as he had done many times before, Looney suggested they check out what Barbie was up to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen they arrived at the pond, they found a large wooden cake with Barbie and Ken on top. Barbie wore a wedding dress and Ken donned the clothes of a prince. In his hands, he held a sign that read, \u201cEmma, Will You Marry Me?\u201d\n\nA video taken of that moment by the men who created the display (after receiving a letter from Looney) shows Benjamin jumping up and down after she realizes what is happening.\n\n\u201cMy goal was to try to find something quintessentially D.C. without the monuments or the politics or the White House,\u201d Looney, 29, told me on a recent afternoon. The Barbie Pond allowed him to achieve that, he said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve never lived in Dupont, you might have no idea what the Barbie Pond is. But for those who have lived there, it\u2019s such a staple of the community.\u201d\n\nThe highly anticipated release of the Barbie movie has been bringing much attention lately to the iconic doll and all her pink accessories. In the D.C. region, bars, beer gardens and theaters have planned events that play to the theme. For people with dogs, there is even a \u201cBarbie Yappy Hour\u201d that promises to have cocktails, games and a costume contest.\n\nBut before the rest of the country started obsessing about Barbie, many D.C. residents knew where they could find Barbie putting on a show. At the Barbie Pond, she has long been a star.\n\nThree longtime friends create the installations at the pond, and over the years, they have mostly avoided public attention. They have declined most media interview requests in the past. But this isn\u2019t just any moment. This is Barbie\u2019s moment. So, I reached out to them recently. They agreed to share the story of the pond on the condition that I identify them by only their first names \u2014 Craig, Jon and Brent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first thing you should know about the men, who are in their 40s and 50s, is that they don\u2019t take themselves too seriously. They laugh \u2014 a lot \u2014 at their displays and at themselves.\n\n\u201cWe are three grown men playing with Barbies, and we\u2019re totally comfortable with that,\u201d Craig told me. \u201cThe running joke between us is \u2018Is it time to hang it up?\u2019 We\u2019re not really serious because we get so much joy out of it. We also keep getting feedback from people that it means something to them, and we don\u2019t want to let them down.\u201d\n\nThe work at the pond started small and without consistency. The homeowner, Brent, put some cake toppers in that space, and it drew some laughs. He then kept placing figures there and eventually started using Barbies. Craig and Jon joined the effort about a decade ago, and the three now regularly work together to create the scenes. They try to put up a new one each month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCraig said it\u2019s especially helpful that Jon is a carpenter: \u201cOtherwise it would all be made out of duct tape, hopes and prayers.\u201d\n\nShare this article Share\n\nJon turned a toy car into a moon rover for a display that honored the 50th anniversary of the moon landing, and he built an Eiffel Tower for a display that gave a nod to the show \u201cEmily in Paris.\u201d\n\nOther displays have shown Barbie and her crew celebrating Cinco de Mayo, Pride month and Hanukkah. There have been Barbies in drag and Barbies wrapped in American flags. There have been Ken dolls that appear pregnant. That display went up after the U.S. Supreme Court decided to overturn Roe v. Wade. A sign next to those Ken dolls read, \u201cThings Would Be Different IF \u2026\u201d\n\nThe men post videos of all the displays on an Instagram page, and their latest creation has drawn the highest online engagement yet. More than 50,000 users have viewed it. That installation features a Supreme Court made up of nine women seated in front of an American flag and a sign that reads \u201c#Goals.\u201d The song that plays with it: \u201cNot Ready to Make Nice\u201d by the Chicks.\n\n\u201cBest Barbie pond ever!!\u201d reads one of the comments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAmen to that!!\u201d reads a second.\n\n\u201cYou never disappoint! Brilliant!\u201d reads yet another.\n\nI asked Craig whether the displays draw much hate, either in person or online. He said they surprisingly don\u2019t. He said the Instagram page has accumulated more than 30,000 followers, and many of the people who live near the pond are protective of it. People have even left dolls and thank-you notes at the site.\n\n\u201cThe biggest surprise has been the people from out of town,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery once in a while, we\u2019ll get people from across the country and even other parts of the world, and they will tell us that the pond was on their list of things to see.\u201d\n\nHe described that as \u201cmind boggling\u201d in a voice filled with awe. He said they never expected a little pond with Barbie dolls to come to mean something to so many people.\n\nThey never expected it to become a permanent part of a couple\u2019s story."

    "text": "Tom Cruise knows how to sell tickets\u2014even to other people\u2019s movies. \u201cThis summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters,\u201d the Mission: Impossible star wrote on Instagram recently, while he and director Christopher McQuarrie posed with tickets in front of posters for rival films. Cruise congratulated Harrison Ford for \u201ccreating one of the most iconic characters in cinema history\u201d with Indiana Jones, and identified himself as one of the many people who\u2019d make a double feature out of Oppenheimer and Barbie, which will go head-to-head in theaters as of July 21. His act of goodwill proved to be contagious, as he must have hoped it would. A few days later, Barbie director Greta Gerwig and star Margot Robbie tweeted their own photo shoot, in which they also waved tickets to their rivals: \u201cMission: Accepted!\u201d\n\nSummer box office used to be the ultimate showbiz blood sport. Now, publicly at least, it\u2019s all kumbaya and collegiality, which says a lot about the industry\u2019s enduring post-pandemic fears. Beneath the gracious social media shoutouts is a pervasive sense that if the public doesn\u2019t fall back in love with in-person moviegoing for good now, the bottom will continue to fall out of the studio system and take stars down in the process. So far, summer 2023 has proven to be a bumpy ride. Sure-things have struggled, surprise sleepers have failed to emerge, and pressure is mounting on a handful of July titles to save the season.\n\nBox office watchers are still predicting that movies like Mission: Impossible\u2014Dead Reckoning Part One and Barbie can help summer ticket sales in the US and Canada hit $4 billion, which would be taken as a sign that the industry has indeed recovered from an anemic three years. But a trail of early underperformers\u2014including DC\u2019s The Flash, Pixar\u2019s Elemental, and Indy\u2019s fifth and final outing, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\u2014has only stoked worries. With his cheerleading post, Cruise, the man who \u201csaved Hollywood\u2019s ass\u201d last summer with Top Gun: Maverick, is attempting to stage a rescue mission again. This time he\u2019ll have some help from Barbie and the atomic bomb.\n\nHollywood power brokers are watching all this closely, to say the least. \u201cI was very excited after Super Mario Bros., and then I got a little more concerned after the last four weeks,\u201d says producer Jason Blum, best known for low-cost horror hits Paranormal Activity, Insidious, and M3GAN. \u201cThe movie business has in no way bounced back like the live events business has, but I really think that it\u2019s a matter of time.\u201d Few expect earnings to surpass summer 2019 levels\u2014when 32 films brought in $4.34 billion\u2014but anything close will be a win. The industry is used to absorbing bad news\u2014and hoping for last-minute salvation. \u201cNot everything works,\u201d says another studio executive poring over summer ticket sales, \u201cbut that\u2019s just the movie business.\u201d\n\nThere are reasons to be at least optimism-adjacent. Moviegoers still want to see spectacle\u2014and they are willing to pay extra to see it on premium large-format screens. \u201c2023 has definitely been a much fuller slate than pre-pandemic times,\u201d says IMAX CEO Richard Gelfond. \u201cAnd for us, it\u2019s even a little more intense because the audience has shifted more to premium on a global basis. IMAX\u2019s market share went up by 50% in North America and it\u2019s gone up by about 40% globally. So it\u2019s not only more competition within the industry, it\u2019s more competition for IMAX screens. We think our box office will be similar to 2019.\u201d\n\nSimilar is the new amazing.\n\nMoviegoers signaled that they were ready to return to theaters last summer when they showed up in droves for Top Gun: Maverick, the top performer of the year with a staggering $719 million in US ticket sales, and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which outperformed 2016\u2019s Doctor Strange. But the robust performance of a handful of titles belied ongoing challenges. Last winter, as one Oscar contender after another died gasping at the box office, a senior awards strategist told Vanity Fair, \u201cthe audience is just not there anymore for these sorts of movies.\u201d One obstacle was simply a volume problem: Even though tentpoles like Avatar: The Way of Water were dominating the weekend, there just weren\u2019t enough movies in theaters.\n\nThis summer, every weekend offers multiple options, and they\u2019re often aimed at disparate demographics, as with the showdown referred to in some quarters as \u201cBarbenheimer.\u201d Since May 5, when Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 dropped, there\u2019s been a steady beat of new releases, among them The Little Mermaid, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, and Transformers: Rise of the Beasts. The major studios are expected to release 42 films widely across the country by Labor Day weekend. One studio executive moans about all this in a way that sounds almost nostalgic: \u201cIt\u2019s such a crowded summer.\u201d\n\nBefore Cruise began his goodwill campaign, the actor was involved in a behind-the-scenes fight for IMAX screens, according to Puck. His latest Mission: Impossible outing will play on IMAX screens for about a week, but then must give them up for Oppenheimer, which debuts a week later on July 21 and has all the screens exclusively booked for three weeks. That has little to do with earnings expectations, and everything to do with relationships. Nolan, a longtime IMAX champion, had struck a deal long before with the exhibitor to guarantee that his movie would play on those screens, regardless of who else parachuted into the market on a motorcycle.\n\nIMAX\u2019s Gelfond tells VF that he worked closely with Nolan and Universal on Oppenheimer\u2019s release date more than a year ago. He visited the Mission: Impossible set and is \u201ca huge fan of Tom\u2019s,\u201d he says, but this is the bottom line: \u201cWe made a commitment to Chris. Obviously, I think the movie\u2019s going to be great, but irrespective, we honor our commitments.\u201d\n\nExecutives worried about a crowded schedule are one sign that movies are back, baby. \u201cWe\u2019ve had really big films since reopening from the pandemic, like Avatar and Top Gun and Spider-Man, but now we\u2019re talking about many titles,\u201d says Elizabeth Frank, the executive in charge of programming AMC Entertainment\u2019s more than 10,000 screens. \u201cPeople are saying, \u2018Well, which one do you want to see first?\u2019 And that\u2019s a different level of excitement. In an industry where momentum is really important, it\u2019s an opportunity for us to build back habitual moviegoing.\u201d\n\nIn Hollywood, the weekend box office is treated with the same seriousness as the World Series. \u201cI have a group of friends, we get together at the beginning of the year and we have a draft, we pick all the movies for the year, and points are awarded based on Metacritic score, based on box office, based on awards, and based on profitability,\u201d says Blum, whose company, Blumhouse, has Insidious: The Red Door out on July 7. \u201cWe text each other every Thursday or Friday. I\u2019m currently in second place.\u201d\n\nGuys like Blum no doubt pay closer attention to movie ticket sales than the average American, but even he has noticed that more people are following the money as they did years ago. \u201cThe box office derby is one of those things that everyone can be a part of,\u201d says Paul Dergarabedian, an entertainment industry analyst for Comscore. \u201cNot everyone has played professional sports or ridden a horse professionally or driven a race car, but we can all sit in a movie theater.\u201d\n\nMore scrutiny, of course, means more headlines when movies stumble. For every winner like Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (with its $356 million in domestic grosses) or Spider Man: Across the Spider-Verse ($346 million), there\u2019s something like The Flash, which has pulled a meager $102 million in the US in spite of its reported $200 million budget, or Elemental, whose $29.6 million debut was considered a major flop for Disney\u2019s Pixar. Meanwhile, Dial of Destiny, which reportedly cost $295 million, arguably needed to make a lot more over Fourth of July than it did. One bright spot? Studios are focusing more on profitability, which Blum contends, \u201ceveryone forgot about for about five years.\u201d Now, he says, there\u2019s more pressure to rein in costs: \u201cThe budget conversation was the last conversation when you were introducing new projects to buyers. Now it\u2019s the first, which makes me happy because I think less expensive movies are often better and more interesting.\u201d\n\nEven before June gloom hit the box office, Hollywood had largely put its faith in Mission: Impossible, Barbie, and Oppenheimer to carry ticket sales. Now it\u2019s even more imperative that all three titles find their audiences. Early tracking\u2014which pegs the Mission: Impossible opening at around $90 million, Barbie somewhere north of $70 million, and Oppenheimer around $40 million\u2014suggests that they will. Though Ethan Hunt will likely be the biggest star of the summer, media attention has focused squarely on the matchup between Barbie and Oppenheimer.\n\n\u201cI do think a rising tide lifts all boats,\u201d says a top film agent. \u201cWhen we have pictures in theaters that start to feel like they\u2019re \u2018watercooler\u2019\u2014which I really think the Barbie-Oppenheimer thing is becoming\u2014it\u2019s incredibly healthy for the box office, because what we\u2019re doing is delivering an experience that people feel like was worth their time and money.\u201d\n\nAMC has been preparing for the summer movie season by extending operating hours at its theaters, hiring more staff, and making sure its Icee dispensers are full. \u201cIncreasingly, fans of different films are also looking for movie-themed merchandise and movie-themed drinks,\u201d says Frank. \u201cIt makes the moviegoing experience that much more engaging and dynamic. It\u2019s a little complicated, though, to be moving in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle cups while you\u2019re figuring out whether you\u2019ve still got a bunch of people who want the Mission: Impossible ones or the Barbie ones.\u201d\n\nPredicting the box office has always been like reading tea leaves or tarot cards. Even IMAX\u2019s Gelfond admits to fixating on the returns\u2014from the first night to the last. \u201cLike a junkie,\u201d he says. \u201cI hate to admit it, but yes. Most of our movies open on Thursday nights because they\u2019re big blockbusters. So by Friday morning, I\u2019m on the phone with our distribution and marketing teams trying to understand what the weekend\u2019s going to look like and what\u2019s working and not working and why and why not.\u201d\n\nIf you want to know how summer 2023 turns out, you\u2019ll have to wait for the final reel."

    "text": "The new Barbie movie starring Margot Robbie has sparked fresh interest in all things Barbie, including collectibles. Mattel, Barbie\u2019s maker, estimates there are well over 100,000 active collectors, many of whom attend the annual Barbie convention (held in early July this year in Orlando).\n\nWhen Barbie was introduced in 1959, I was 10 \u2014 too old, I thought, to play with dolls. Then, in 1995, I saw photos of a No. 1 Barbie and a trunkful of clothes found in an abandoned storage locker. I was hooked.\n\nAs I began collecting vintage dolls, it was interesting to see how Barbie\u2019s hairstyles evolved in her early years \u2014 from a ponytail and curly bangs in the Elvis era, to a bouffant \u201cbubblecut\u201d when Jackie Kennedy was first lady to a sleek pageboy in the mid-\u201860s and then to the long straight hair of the hippie and Mod generation.\n\nLooking to explore the Tampa Bay area? Subscribe to our free One Day in Tampa Bay newsletter series Once a week, you\u2019ll get insider tips on things to do, dining and more to help you plan a perfect day in a local city or neighborhood. Loading... You\u2019re all signed up! Want more of our free, weekly newsletters in your inbox? Let\u2019s get started. Explore all your options\n\nIt was the clothes, though, that were truly captivating, hand-sewn couture fashions made of exquisite fabrics with metal snaps and zippers. At her peak of elegance in 1965, Barbie wore satin evening gowns, gold lame sheaths and tweed suits trimmed with real fur. Outfits had names like Shimmering Magic and Debutante Ball. And oh, the accessories \u2014 tiny compacts, pearl necklaces, even a portfolio with fashion sketches.\n\nThe oldest and generally most sought-after dolls were made in Japan. As that country became wealthier and labor costs rose, Barbie\u2019s story tracked that of the world\u2019s emerging markets \u2014 production moved to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Mexico, Malaysia, Indonesia and China.\n\nWith Barbie aging (albeit beautifully), prices for some of the earliest dolls have soared. At Marl and B, a Bradenton shop specializing in vintage Barbies, a No. 1 doll was recently listed at $15,000 and some bubblecuts as much as $1,500. (Prices on eBay tend to be less.) Condition is key. Bad hair, missing fingers and toes and the dreaded green ear \u2014 caused by metal earring posts interacting with the plastic in the doll\u2019s head \u2014 dramatically affect value. As for the clothes, one way to spot the earliest ones is by their black-and-white embroidered tags. Accessories \u2014 often lost or sucked up in vacuum cleaners \u2014 can be scarcer and more valuable than the clothes.\n\nIn anticipation of the Barbie movie, a friend and I got out our vintage dolls. Maybe I was too old for Barbie at 10, but not anymore."

    "text": "This is a preview of our pop culture newsletter The Daily Beast\u2019s Obsessed, written by editor Kevin Fallon. To receive the full newsletter in your inbox each week, sign up for it here.\n\nI remember when the first Harry Potter film came out in 2001. I was [redacted] years old. Weeks ahead of time, a group of friends and I sent one of our parents (probably my dad) to the movie theater (singular) in the county where I grew up to buy advance tickets to the opening-night midnight showing. Most of us liked the Harry Potter books, but we weren\u2019t among the wild obsessives you imagine when you hear about Harry Potter fans. Still, we were excited.\n\nWe made T-shirts. Mine said, \u201cHonk if you\u2019re a Potthead.\u201d (I had never smoked pot; I thought it was hilarious anyway.) A girlfriend of mine\u2019s shirt said, \u201cShow me that 11-inch wand, nice and supple,\u201d a reference that several parents did not like to Harry\u2019s magical wand in the book. We stood for hours in a line that snaked through the strip mall and into the parking lot, to make sure we could get seats together.\n\nI don\u2019t think we even took a photo, which would be unheard of now. But in 2001, what were we even going to do with one? MySpace didn\u2019t exist yet. There was no thought of memorializing the moment or trading it for online likes and clout. It was just\u2026 fun.\n\nI bring this up now, because the current widespread enthusiasm for the Barbie movie reminds me of that experience. Barbie is still two weeks from its July 21 release date, but is seemingly all anyone can talk about.\n\nObviously my Harry Potter story is a personal one. Maybe you have a similar memory related to the Twilight films, the Lord of the Rings franchise, a particular Marvel movie, or Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again. (OK, that last one might just be me.) It\u2019s now a regular occurrence for an \u201cevent\u201d release to take over the pop-culture news cycle, sell scores of advance tickets, and be greeted with people in costume to celebrate.\n\nIt\u2019s at a point, thanks to social media and the rise of memes, where the enthusiasm has morphed into something ironic: the #GentleMinions phenomenon/fiasco, for example. That\u2019s why I cherish my Harry Potter moviegoing experience. It was innocent and genuine, and I\u2019ve loved seeing some of those earnest feelings return in the lead-up to the Barbie movie. It\u2019s not that there haven\u2019t been other examples of that type of anticipation for a new release. With Barbie, though, it seems to be on a whole other scale.\n\nThe unrelenting nature of this Barbie press and promo push is particularly remarkable in that, at least anecdotally, people don\u2019t seem to be exhausted by or exasperated with it yet.\n\nThe on-set photos of stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling in their fluorescent costumes sparked a curiosity last year that not only hasn\u2019t waned, but it also has helped set off a fireworks show of eager giddiness online whenever there\u2019s a new trailer, clip, red carpet interview, or announcement about the film\u2019s soundtrack. The reaction to an advanced clip of Gosling as Ken interacting with several of the film\u2019s Barbies was akin to the viral footage of that time all of San Diego\u2019s fireworks went off at once, which resurfaced over the holiday weekend. People loved it.\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t believe in hyperbole or over-exaggeration. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll merely say that, based on that 44-second clip, Gosling deserves to win Best Actor at the Oscars, or else the Academy should be legally forced to disband and each voter required to write handwritten letters to every American expressing their shame and begging for forgiveness.\n\nEach new stage of this Barbie press tour sets a new bar for what fans who have been following it would expect, and it has yet to disappoint.\n\nWere you expecting great fashion from the Barbie red carpets? Not only does Robbie look spectacular\u2014rescuing what was a not-so-stellar red-carpet reputation, if we\u2019re being kind\u2014but each of the ensembles is also meticulously inspired by classic outfits worn by Barbie dolls.\n\nDid you think that Gosling would obviously be entertaining doing interviews in support of this film? Not only is he handsome and charming, but he is also more handsome and charming than I could have fantasized about. I watched a clip of an interview where he tells the male interviewer that he is \u201cKenough,\u201d and now I am with child.\n\nAs for stunts: Maybe we should have predicted that someone would build an actual Barbie Dreamhouse in Malibu. Still, we were stunned when someone built an actual Barbie Dreamhouse in Malibu, which can be booked as an Airbnb. (Watch my colleague Fletcher Peters tour it here.) And should anyone be worried that the Barbie hype may not be reaching those who are not terminally online like me, HGTV will be airing Barbie Dreamhouse Challenge, where teams compete to makeover a home into a Barbie oasis. Now my parents can join in the fun.\n\nThe Barbie pandemonium is most noticeable because the pre-release buzz for the other major, sure-to-be blockbuster being released the same day, Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer, throws it into sharp relief.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the color scheme: Barbie\u2019s all neon pinks, in contrast to Oppenheimer\u2019s black-and-white and sepia. It\u2019s not just the stereotypical demographics, if we wanted to be reductive: the female-targeting demo of Barbie versus the cinema bros who thirst for Nolan\u2019s films. It\u2019s that the reaction to the Barbie marketing is so loud in comparison to Oppenheimer that you might forget that the latter film is about the testing of the atomic bomb. (Memes comparing the two films\u2019 PR strategies are delightful and also fascinating looks into how movie fans view the film industry.)\n\nListen, I\u2019m no Ken Doll\u2014for many reasons, including that I\u2019m not delusional enough to ignore that this hoopla is directed tied to capitalist, commercial interests. Barbie is a product owned by a toy company that is expanding its IP into cinema and flooding the field to garner interest in the film. But similar interests controlled the Harry Potter film rollout all those years ago. Two things can be true: the cynical nature of corporatism defining art\u2026 and the desire to have fun. Barbie is giving both\u2014and all before any of us has even seen the movie.\n\nKeep obsessing!

I think it\u2019s going to be a movie that evokes conversation when people can get into a fiery debate about something.\n\n\"I think that\u2019s good, I like that\u2026 versatility, I guess.\u201d\n\nAustralian actress Robbie, lifted the lid on how Cena landed his cameo role, revealing she may have pulled a few strings after Cena displayed an act of kindness in a London restaurant.\n\n\"It happened while we were filming in London. I ran into him at a restaurant and we\u2019d worked together before,\u201d said Robbie.\n\n\u201cI ran into him because I went to pay the bill and they told me, \u2018John Cena already took care of it.\u2019\n\n4 Cena will play the role of a merman in the new Barbie movie Credit: @discussingfilm\n\n4 He looks pretty different from his in-ring persona Credit: Getty\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018what?

But when he posted pictures of the shirt on his Twitter feed, he said, it took off beyond his expectations.\n\n\u201cI normally get about three or four likes on anything I post,\u201d Hudson said. But after sharing a few mock-ups of the shirt, he woke up one morning to hundreds of messages from people asking him if they could buy it.\n\nHudson makes the shirts himself, with a friend, and charges $40. So far he said he had made about 150 shirts, with a second batch of about 70 more on the way. It takes him about 45 minutes to an hour to make one T-shirt, which he does by cutting two shirts in half, pinning them together and sewing and pressing them.\n\n\u201cI had a couple of movie theaters reach out to me privately to do bulk orders for employees,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been overwhelmingly positive.\u201d"

    "text": "Barbenheimer and Beyond: Hollywood's Greatest Box Office Showdowns\n\nAs the battle of Barbenheimer is decided, we look back on some other classic pairings of films that came out on the same day\n\nImage by Hamza Rasheed\n\nPublished Jul 20, 2023\n\nWhen Warner Bros. Pictures announced the release date for Barbie at CinemaCon in April 2022, eagle-eyed film fans were quick to note that Oppenheimer 's release date, which was announced in late 2021, was scheduled for the same weekend. As July 21, 2023 approached, Barbie's marketing painted cities pink and the internet delighted in sharing memes of the famously introverted Cillian Murphy, Oppenheimer's lead, minding his own business. The diametrically opposed movies offer something for everyone, but their box office battle is more than just a pink explosion for the internet.As pandemic-induced restrictions began to ease, Warner Bros. announced that their entire 2021 slate was going to be released simultaneously in theatres and on HBO Max (as it was then called). In response, Christopher Nolan, one of the studio's most prominent directors, was outspoken in his criticism of the move, describing the decision as making \"no economic sense.\" Although WB was Nolan's home for the better part of 20 years, it was of little surprise that he began shopping his latest film to other studios after their public falling out. It's of even littler surprise that his former employer has decisively pulled out all the stops in their counter-programming strategy.\"Barbenheimer\" isn't the first time two big titles face off at the box office \u2014 it isn't even the first time Universal Pictures, Warner Bros. and Nolan have danced this dance. From '80s tentpoles to Christmas fare, we look back at some of the greatest (and most curious) box office showdowns in cinema history.As for Barbie vs. Oppenheimer, who will come out on top is anyone's guess. Nolan's fanbase is ardent and IMAX-happy, but it's hard to discount the fact that Barbie feels like a moment. For my money, it's a peculiarly excellent double feature waiting to happen: come on, Oppy, let's go party.While the box office numbers may seem wildly lopsided, it's important to note that The Shining only released on 10 screens during the Memorial Day weekend compared to The Empire Strikes Back's 126 theatres (the latter also began showing in cinemas two days earlier). Empire would go on to be the top domestic grossing film of 1980 (The Shining was twelfth) and set a new standard for how good sequels could be \u2014 but Stanley Kubrick's iconic film, though met with mixed reviews on its initial release, is now considered a bonafide classic in its own right.There are many films that can be considered decade-defining in the '80s, but Ghostbusters and Gremlins represented a shift in the horror genre with the addition of pure comedy; perhaps in keeping with the tubular '80s, viewers looked for the humour in even the most terrifying scenes. However, for some parents, Gremlins took this concept a bit too far, with many not realizing the film was not suitable for children, prompting many to walk out before the film ended that opening weekend. It's rather fitting that two films so emblematic of the decade would be released on the same weekend, with just $1.1 million separating the two.Considering Point Break opened in twice the amount of theatres as Boyz n the Hood, John Singleton's seminal film is the emphatic winner in this SoCal movie competition. Although the two films have a shared location (sort of), Boyz n the Hood's authentic exploration of a much-maligned neighbourhood has cemented it as an American classic, while Point Break continues to delight as a pulpy cop thriller. Neither film toppled Terminator 2: Judgment Day in its second weekend (or earned more than the fourth theatrical re-release of 101 Dalmatians), but they are still beloved by audiences today, albeit for very different reasons.On the surface, it feels like an unfair comparison. The Matrix was one of the biggest cinematic events in the '90s and had an instant impact on pop culture that continues to resonate today. But in 1999, the teen high school comedy really was all the rage. Similar to how I imagine the crowds for Barbie and Oppenheimer will be, The Matrix brought out all the sci-fi boys to the yard, while 10 Things I Hate About You seemed destined to fulfill the angst-ridden high schooler of the day. Both movies have continued to find life beyond their theatrical releases, but one was just on a slightly larger scale than the other.The tale of two Christmases, Elf and Love Actually appeal to different sides of the yuletide from different sides of the pond. Given that Love Actually is a distinctly British film, it's surprising that it was released in the US and Canada two weeks ahead of the UK (where Love Actually topped Elf). Canadian and American audiences were decidedly Team Buddy upon their debuts, but both films have found a place in many households during Christmas. (Fun fact: The Matrix Revolutions was also released on this day and took the top spot at the box office that weekend with $48 million.)Christopher Nolan, Universal Pictures and Warner Bros. were once again behind the ultimate counter-programming move, although the parties were all on different sides than for today's Oppenheimer/Barbie showdown. Nolan and WB were in the midst of their successful partnership, and excitement was exceptionally high for the director's follow-up to 2005's Batman Begins. Universal, in a bid to cut into their competitor's box office receipts, released a rom-com musical, but to no avail. Not only did The Dark Knight crush Mamma Mia! in its opening weekend, it also became the top-grossing film of the year, crossing the $1 billion mark worldwide."

    "text": "Do you hear the term \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d a lot these days? There are times in the ever-changing film business that completely transform the processes of film production, distribution, and reception. July 21, 2023, marked one such milestone, with the emergence of an Internet phenomenon known as \u201cBarbenheimer.\u201d This viral sensation revolved around two films with seemingly opposite genres and themes \u2013 \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d \u2013 both set to hit theaters simultaneously. As the amalgamation of these titles suggests, the trend captured the attention of millions, showcasing the powerful impact of social media on shaping the film industry\u2019s future.\n\nThe term \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d was coined by online fandoms, who quickly embraced the dual theatrical release of the two movies. Through hashtags, memes, and creative fan-made content, social media became the driving force behind the success of this cinematic experiment. The interplay between die-hard fans, curious cinephiles, and casual moviegoers led to an unprecedented buzz, leading to an influx of bookings across theaters worldwide.\n\nI've been seeing a lot of incredible fan art, mashups and parody posters for what is now known as \"Barbenheimer\". Felt inspired and thought I'd join in on the fun! So here's a little Photoshop fun by me for the DOUBLE FEATURE OF THE CENTURY! \ud83d\udc60\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\ude0e pic.twitter.com/qUmDkbIMso \u2014 Steve Reeves (@stevereevesart) July 11, 2023\n\nAMC Theaters, one of the largest cinema chains, exemplified the tangible influence of social media on this unique event. More than 20,000 of their AMC Stubs members proudly proclaimed their intent to witness both films on the same day. The phenomenon sparked conversations and debates that extended far beyond cinema seats, permeating various online platforms, news outlets, and even academic discussions.\n\nBut what exactly were the implications of Barbenheimer, and how did social media facilitate this groundbreaking marketing success? As industry experts delve into the matter, several key factors come to light. The intertwining of social media and film promotion has proven to be a potent force, capable of not only generating hype but also shaping the narrative surrounding these movies.\n\nThrough interactive campaigns, directors, producers, and studios harnessed the power of user-generated content, turning fans into enthusiastic brand ambassadors. As audiences shared their anticipation, speculations, and personal connections to both Barbie and Oppenheimer, the films acquired a life of their own, transforming into cultural touchstones even before their official release.\n\nAdditionally, the ease of communication on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube facilitated instant feedback loops. Filmmakers could gauge public sentiment and adjust their marketing strategies accordingly, creating a symbiotic relationship with their audience. The barrier between creators and consumers blurred, opening up new possibilities for more inclusive storytelling.\n\nAs we explore the realm of Barbenheimer and social media\u2019s impact on the film industry, this blog post will delve into the underlying mechanisms that made this viral event possible. From the role of online fandoms in shaping modern cinema to the influence of social media in constructing movie identities, we aim to provide an expert analysis of the convergence between art, marketing, and the digital age.\n\nWhat is Barbenheimer?\n\nBarbenheimer is a portmanteau of the words \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d two major summer blockbusters that are set to be released on the same weekend, July 21, 2023. Fans first argued about whether the film was better and which one they would watch, but then wondered, \u201cWhy not both?\u201d As a result, the name \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d was coined, and viewers promised to sit through both films in their entirety on the same day. Fans even created a trailer for it!\n\nThe popularity of the fad on the internet has helped make it a marketing success. For instance, AMC Theatres stated that more than 20,000 of its AMC Stubs members had purchased tickets to see both films on the same day. Barbenheimer became so popular that even merchants began to be made about it. When you go to a movie right now, you\u2019re more likely to see one of these than just the Oppenheimer t-shirt.\n\nmy tshirt arrived pic.twitter.com/U5UHZpGfSc \u2014 laila \ud83c\udf3fTHREE TIME EMMY NOMINEE PEDRO PASCAL (@falconsnat) June 29, 2023\n\nHere are some of the reasons why Barbenheimer is trending:\n\nThe two films are both major blockbusters that are set to be released on the same weekend.\n\nThe films are very different from each other, which has created a lot of anticipation and debate about which film will be more successful.\n\nThe term Barbenheimer is catchy and easy to remember, which has helped it to spread quickly on social media.\n\nThe dating trend that has been dubbed \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d is also generating a lot of buzz.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how Barbenheimer plays out in the coming weeks and months. Will it become a box office success? Will it become a lasting cultural phenomenon? Only time will tell.\n\nActors also love the idea of \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d\n\nActors from both \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and \u201cBarbie\u201d seem enthusiastic about the idea; in fact, \u201cBarbie\u201d star Margot Robbie has already planned out her ideal \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d weekend.\n\nAt Wednesday\u2019s London premiere of her film, Robbie said, \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect double bill.\u201d In my opinion, \u201cI think actually start your day with \u2018Barbie,\u2019 then go straight into \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 and then a \u2018Barbie\u2019 chaser.\u201d\n\nRyan Gosling, who plays Ken in \u201cBarbie,\u201d agreed, stating he would first watch \u201cBarbie,\u201d then \u201c\u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 for lunch,\u201d and then \u201cBarbie\u201d again.\n\nCillian Murphy, who plays the protagonist in \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d told IGN that he \u201c100 percent\u201d intended to see \u201cBarbie\u201d and that Barbenheimer was \u201cjust great for the industry and for audiences \u2026 you can spend the whole day in the cinema. What\u2019s better than that?\u201d\n\nSocial media\u2019s effect on the film industry and marketing\n\nBarbenheimer is just the latest example of social media\u2019s effect on the film industry and marketing. Social media has revolutionized the film industry and transformed how movies are marketed and experienced. Here are some key ways in which social media has had a profound effect on the film industry and its marketing strategies:\n\nAudience engagement and interaction: Social media platforms provide an unprecedented opportunity for filmmakers and studios to engage directly with their audience. Through official accounts, hashtags, and live Q&A sessions, filmmakers can interact with fans, respond to questions, and build a sense of community. This engagement fosters a deeper emotional connection between the audience and the film, driving anticipation and word-of-mouth marketing.\n\nSocial media platforms provide an unprecedented opportunity for filmmakers and studios to engage directly with their audience.

Viral marketing and fandom culture: Social media thrives on viral content, and films with dedicated fan bases can leverage this phenomenon to their advantage. Fandoms play a crucial role in generating buzz around movies, with fan art, fan theories, and fan fiction becoming significant drivers of online conversations. Studios recognize the value of these fan-driven initiatives, often incorporating fan-generated content into official marketing campaigns to amplify the movie\u2019s reach.\n\nSocial media thrives on viral content, and films with dedicated fan bases can leverage this phenomenon to their advantage.

Real-time feedback and data analytics: Social media platforms offer filmmakers and marketing teams real-time feedback on trailers, teasers, and other promotional materials. By monitoring audience reactions, sentiment, and engagement metrics, studios can fine-tune their marketing strategies or even make changes to a film\u2019s direction before its release. Data-driven insights from social media help studios identify trends, target specific demographics, and understand audience preferences better.\n\nSocial media platforms offer filmmakers and marketing teams real-time feedback on trailers, teasers, and other promotional materials.

Influencer partnerships offer a way to access niche audiences, generating interest and excitement among groups that might not typically engage with traditional marketing channels.\n\nInfluencers and content creators on social media have massive followings and can sway opinions.

Extended storytelling and transmedia campaigns: Social media allows filmmakers to extend storytelling beyond the confines of the movie screen. They can create transmedia campaigns that incorporate interactive elements, alternate reality games, and online puzzles, enriching the movie\u2019s universe and keeping audiences engaged long after the film\u2019s release. This approach transforms the film into a multi-platform experience, enticing fans to explore the narrative across different media channels.\n\nSocial media allows filmmakers to extend storytelling beyond the confines of the movie screen.

Crowdsourced marketing and user-generated content: Audiences have become active participants in film marketing through user-generated content (UGC). Fans create memes, trailers, and promotional videos, sharing them across social media platforms, effectively becoming co-creators of the movie\u2019s marketing campaign. This organic sharing enhances the film\u2019s visibility, authenticity, and credibility.\n\nHow AI and big data analytics are changing influencer marketing\n\nIn conclusion, social media\u2019s effect on the film industry and marketing has been transformative. It has empowered audiences, broken down barriers between filmmakers and fans, and opened up new avenues for creativity and engagement. As social media platforms continue to evolve, the film industry must adapt and harness the power of these digital tools to stay connected with audiences and drive success in an ever-competitive landscape.\n\nFeatured image credit: DiscussingFilm"

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor about a year, a box office battle has been brewing between \"Barbie\" and Oppenheimer\" \u2014 the two much-anticipated films from Oscar-nominated directors that are set to be released on exactly the same day.\n\nOn July 21, the feud between Greta Gerwig's take on the Mattel doll and Christopher Nolan's epic will come to a head in what has been dubbed \"Barbenheimer.\"\n\nThe films' release date may be where the similarities between them end. One film, after all, is about a plastic doll and her boyfriend. The other is about Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who helped the United States develop the first nuclear bomb and changed the course of the Second World War.\n\nGiven the enduring popularity of Barbie, it's maybe no great surprise that her first outing on the big screen is expected to emerge triumphant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's predicted to gross between $70 million and $80 million on its first three days in US theaters, according to internal projections from Warner Bros. seen by The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThat's as much as double the $40 million that Universal Pictures expects \"Oppenheimer\" to take in the same period, per the report. (Part of the discrepancy may be length: \"Oppenheimer\" runs for three hours, which means theaters can't squeeze in as many screenings of it as they can of \"Barbie,\" which comes in at a touch under two hours.)\n\nCillian Murphy plays the nuclear physicist in \"Oppenheimer.\" Eamonn McCormack/Getty Images\n\nWhile both movies cost about $100 million to make, the marketing hype for \"Barbie\" continues to amaze many observers. There's even a full-scale replica of Barbie's Malibu Dream house listed on Airbnb.\n\nNo matter who wins, the feud may be less contentious than audiences have been led to believe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCritics point out that the competing releases are a top-notch example of \"counter-programming\" by both studios \u2013 a reference to simultaneously releasing titles that'll appeal to very different audiences.\n\nThe biggest audience for Gerwig's film, which stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, is likely to be women under 35, per The Hollywood Reporter. The trade publication points out that it's the same demographic that helped turn the \"Mamma Mia\" and \"Sex and the City\" movies into box-office monsters.\n\nNolan, meanwhile, will be hoping that his latest feature, which boasts an A-list cast, erases memories of \"Tenet,\" which bombed after being released in theaters (at his insistence) at the height of the pandemic in 2020.\n\nOf course, as Ryan Gilbey notes for The Guardian, \"there will be some overlap between their audiences.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if you are planning on catching them on the same day, my Insider colleagues Rebecca Cohen and Chris Panella have come up with the perfect schedule for a Barbenheimer double bill, no matter which you see first.\n\nAs they point out: \"While 'Barbie' calls for fruity cocktails and clubbing with the girls, 'Oppenheimer' gives off more of a black coffee and cigarette energy.\"\n\nWhichever film takes the weekend, it's unlikely that either one will beat out \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie,\" which had the best debut of the year. The Nintendo flick is also the highest-grossing film of 2023, making more than $1.3 billion globally.\n\n\"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\" and \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" both made it into nine figures on their opening weekends, taking $120 million and $118 million respectively, according to Comscore figures reported by Variety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOverall it's been a much better year for theaters, with US ticket sales sitting just over $4.3 billion at the six-month mark \u2013 up by 20% over 2022, per Comscore.\n\nThat's before the release of more blockbusters, including \"Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\" and, of course, \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer.\"\n\nAnd no matter what happens on July 21, one thing is certain: As David Gross, who writes a box office newsletter, told The New York Times: \"Audiences are going to find them, and both films are going to do extremely well.\""

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" both slated for a July 21 opening day, the internet is celebrating by creating \"Barbenheimer\" memes inspired by the two very different movies going head-to-head.\n\nIf you've been out of the loop, the fact that Christopher Nolan's \"Oppenheimer\" (a serious film about the atomic-bomb creator, J. Robert Oppenheimer) and Greta Gerwig's movie \"Barbie\" (about the Mattel doll) are both being released on the same day has delighted fans. People are creating schedules for back-to-back viewings. There are plans for what to eat and drink. There are even plans on what to wear.\n\nAnd then there are the memes.\n\nIn an interview with BBC Radio 1 on July 18, Margot Robbie, who stars as Barbie in the titular movie, and Ryan Gosling, who plays Ken, shared their thoughts on the \"Barbenheimer\" memes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked if she had seen the memes, Robbie said that her friends have been sending her a lot of them. \"People are so clever, people who come up with those funny memes,\" she said.\n\nAt the end of the interview, Gosling managed to create a new meme all by himself when he asked, \"What is a meme?\"\n\nTwitter users were quick to pick up on Gosling's reference to \"Oppenheimer\" actor Cillian Murphy, who once asked the same question in an interview with NME.\n\n\"He knew exactly what he was doing there,\" tweeted one user.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Ali showing once again why he's the best at this. Congrats on the birth of a new meme,\" tweeted another.\n\nMeanwhile, Twitter users were creating memes of their own.\n\n\"I feel like this is the Grimace Shake, but for #Barbenheimer. I obviously loved it,\" one user tweeted, referring to the recent viral McDonald's Grimace Shake trend.\n\n\"I love that fans are taking the oppenheimer press into their own hands,\" read another tweet referencing ths smoking pink Barbie house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTikTok users are also creating videos to celebrate the release. The #Barbenheimer hashtag currently has 109 million views.\n\nOne user, who goes by the username @alysilverio, shared a video of a Barbie-themed party she'd thrown. The caption read, \"pov: you throw a barbie themed party and the boys show up like this.\"\n\nIn the video, the men walk through the door wearing flat caps and waistcoats, presumably representing characters from \"Oppenheimer.\" They are greeted by a group of women dressed entirely in pink.\n\nOne of the women is holding a Barbie-themed cake, which the TikTok creator made in a previous TikTok video.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You mean peaky blinders?\" the top comment read.\n\nAnother comment read, \"Wow, that's so Ken of them actually.\"\n\nIn another video that has 3.5 million views, Tess Donatello, who goes by the TikTok username @tessdonatello, showed herself taking off her black \"Oppenheimer\"-themed outfit, to reveal her pink Barbie-themed outfit underneath.\n\n\"BYE THIS ATE,\" read the top comment, which has 59,700 likes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWarner Bros. predicts that \"Barbie\" will take up to $80 million in its first three days \u2014 about double the $40 million that Universal Pictures expects \"Oppenheimer\" to take in the same period.\n\nSources told Insider's Jason Guerrasio that \"Oppenheimer\" writer and director Christopher Nolan wasn't thrilled the studio wanted to release \"Barbie\" the same weekend as \"Oppenheimer.\"\n\nIn a recent interview with Guerrasio about whether \"Barbenheimer\" is \"strictly pettiness\" by Warner Bros, Nolan said, \"Now, you must know I'm not going to answer that question, only to say those who care about the theatrical experience, we've been longing for a crowded marketplace with a lot of different movies. That's what theaters have now, and those of us who care about movies are thrilled about that.\"\n\nThere's still time for even more memes and videos to surface before both movies are released on July 21. The fun has just begun."

Warren Buffett has nodded to both the iconic doll and the father of the atomic bomb over the years.\n\nThe famed investor debuted a set of four exclusive Barbies during Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in 2000. The dolls were cobranded with See's Candies, the Berkshire-owned confectioner that Buffett has hailed as his dream business.\n\nA glamorous blonde assistant in a See's Candies uniform brought two of the dolls to the stage where Buffett and his business partner, Charlie Munger, were seated. She pecked Munger on the cheek, prompting Buffett to quip, \"It's just a sample of what it's like to be an officer at Berkshire.\"\n\n\"This is the new See's Barbie doll,\" Buffett declared. \"And believe it or not, we've come up with three more just like this young woman.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We wanted our shareholders to be the first ones to have a shot at this new product,\" the Berkshire CEO continued, adding cheekily, \"The model is not included.\"\n\nThe lighthearted moment can be watched in full on CNBC's Warren Buffett Archive.\n\nOn a far more serious note, Buffett has frequently touched on J. Robert Oppenheimer's signature creation, the atomic bomb. He's repeatedly underscored the immense threat that nuclear weapons pose to the world.\n\n\"I've been concerned since 1945 when the first atomic bomb was used,\" Buffett said in 2017. \"We have developed over these 72 years, since August of 1945, the ability around the world to almost destroy civilization.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In 1945, we unleashed something like the world had never seen, and that is a pop gun compared to what can be done now,\" he noted during Berkshire's yearly gathering in 2016.\n\nBuffett also called nuclear weapons \"the ultimate problem of mankind\" in 2006. Moreover, the billionaire said in 2016 that if he could reduce the risk of a major nuclear, chemical, biological, or cyber attack by even 5%, he would commit all his wealth toward achieving that goal.\n\nThe Berkshire chief has also asserted that a US president's top priority should be combating those threats, and warned a major nuclear attack is one of the few things that could bankrupt his company.\n\nBuffett hasn't said whether he's going to see \"Barbie\" or \"Oppenheimer\" this weekend. Given he's drummed up demand for special-edition dolls, and banged the drum on nuclear threats, neither option seems out of the question."

    "text": "Nobody would have believed if they were told at the start of 2023 that Oppenheimer and Barbie would be two of the most anticipated movies in India. However, there is massive excitement among Indian viewers for Barbenheimer, both releasing on July 21.\n\nAdvance bookings for the opening day in the top three national chains alone exceeded all predictions, with around three lakh tickets sold for both movies combined, Pinkvilla reported.\n\nFor the opening day, Oppenheimer has managed to sell over two lakh tickets while Barbie followed closely behind with over 80 thousand tickets sold in the top three national chains, as per the publication. These numbers indicate a combined box office collection of anywhere between \u20b915 to 20 crores nett, primarily driven by audiences in metro cities, Pinkvilla added.\n\nRenowned screenwriter Paul Schrader earlier expressed his admiration for Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, likening it to his own iconic works such as \"Taxi Driver\" and \"Raging Bull.\" Calling it the \"most important film of this century,\" Schrader encouraged viewers to experience Oppenheimer's brilliance on the big screen.\n\nAcross the Pacific, Greta Gerwig's Barbie is projected to surpass Oppenheimer in the US box office race, boasting a star-studded cast featuring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. The film is expected to make a dazzling $110 million debut, with industry analysts even predicting it could reach as high as $140 million. Warner Bros, the distributor of \"Barbie,\" remains more cautious, anticipating a $75 million opening in the US market.\n\nInterestingly, while Barbie is dominating the US box office, Oppenheimer's appeal in India is soaring, probably due to Christopher Nolan's esteemed reputation as one of the finest filmmakers of his generation. At the same time, many have termed Oppenheimer as Nolan\u2019s best work till date.\n\nBarbie, on the other hand, comes from a director who has made outstanding films like Lady Bird and Little Women. In a wrapper of childlike presentation, she is delivering something that is more mature than it seems.\n\nMilestone Alert!Livemint tops charts as the fastest growing news website in the world \ud83c\udf0f Click here to know more."

De memes begonnen toen duidelijk werd dat twee van de grote zomerfilms dit jaar \u2013 Greta Gerwigs Barbie en Christopher Nolans Oppenheimer \u2013 in Amerika op dezelfde dag (vrijdag 21 juli) zouden worden uitgebracht. In Nederland worden ze overigens al iets eerder uitgebracht (Barbie op woensdag 19 juli, Oppenheimer een dag later), maar daar had het internet uiteraard geen boodschap aan.\n\nDe grap van Barbenheimer is dat de twee films onderling niet meer van elkaar zouden kunnen verschillen. Barbie is een in roze gedrenkte genderkomedie over de iconische, blonde en langbenige meidenpop van Mattel; Oppenheimer een sombere, serieuze karakterstudie over J. Robert Oppenheimer, de \u2018vader van de atoombom\u2019.\n\nOnline verschenen zelfgemaakte trailers voor Barbenheimer, er kwamen polls voor welke films je bij deze double-bill als eerste moest bekijken, en influencers gingen de straat op om aan mensen te vragen naar welke van deze twee films ze meer uitkeken. Kortom: de hypemachine draaide op volle toeren voor twee films die eigenlijk niets met elkaar te maken hebben."

    "text": "Check out the brain on Barbie! Sure, she\u2019s just a doll, but that doesn\u2019t mean she has to be an airhead. Therein lies \u201cLady Bird\u201d director Greta Gerwig\u2019s inspired, 21st-century solution to bringing one of America\u2019s most iconic playthings to life on the big screen. Combine that with the casting of Margot Robbie in the title role, and \u201cBarbie\u201d is already starting out on the right, perfectly arched foot. So what if this high-concept comedy falls a bit flat in the final stretch?\n\nBarbie\u2019s strength as a brand comes from her aspirational appeal. While some have rightly criticized the doll for setting unrealistic beauty standards, Barbie also showed girls they can do and be anything, as different models have portrayed her as president, a rocket scientist, even trans. You know who else sets unrealistic beauty standards? Movie stars. Like Barbie, they serve as role models, which is what makes Gerwig\u2019s take on the ultra-popular toy line so darn smart. Robbie might be a dead-ringer for Barbie, but her moxie powers the performance. Gerwig has made the kind of family film she surely wishes had been available to her when she was a girl, sneaking a message (several of them, really) inside Barbie\u2019s hollow hourglass figure.\n\nThat\u2019s an admirable achievement, given understandably protective corporate parent Mattel \u2014 though let\u2019s be honest, in the year 2023, it would be a shock (and box office suicide) if \u201cBarbie\u201d arrived without some kind of female-empowerment message baked in. This one checks all the right boxes, while making Ryan Gosling\u2019s dumb-dumb Ken the butt of most of its gender-equity jokes. Boasting fresh tracks from Billie Eilish and Lizzo, the result is a very funny kids\u2019 movie with a freshman liberal arts student\u2019s vocabulary that tosses around terms like \u201cpatriarchy\u201d and \u201cappropriation\u201d \u2014 pretty much everything but \u201cproblematic,\u201d which the movie implies without actually calling Barbie\u2019s legacy.\n\nThat\u2019s the front on which Gerwig and Noah Baumbach\u2019s script feels most daring. \u201cBarbie\u201d doesn\u2019t just poke fun at Mattel; it comes right out and accuses the bestselling doll of setting back the women\u2019s movement. As one indignant teen tells Barbie: \u201cYou\u2019ve been making women feel bad about themselves since you were invented.\u201d This reproach stuns Robbie\u2019s upbeat character, who wakes up every day in the always sunny, hot pink fantasy world where Barbies come in all colors and body types. They win Nobel Prizes and occupy all 12 seats on the Supreme Court. And they\u2019re occasionally pestered by dozens of Ken dolls, who are clearly insecure about being sold (and kept) separately.\n\nBarbie Land, as it\u2019s called, is an inherently hilarious alternate reality modeled on the dream that Mattel has been selling American girls since the doll was introduced in 1959. It looks a lot like the one they\u2019ve seen in countless commercials, where flamingo-bright Barbie Dreamhouses inspire envy as a diverse collection of perky, positive-minded dolls smile and wave at one another (represented here by such avatars as Alexandra Shipp and Dua Lipa, Issa Rae and Ritu Aryu, Hari Nef and Sharon Rooney). It\u2019s a wild pop-art space, all but exploding with supersaturated color, where the doll heads appear lower contrast and backlit, obliging us to squint to make out the actors\u2019 faces.\n\nYou half-expect to see a giant hand reach in from the sky to interact with these lifelike toys, but that\u2019s not how it works. Instead, Gerwig enlists Helen Mirren as narrator to lay out the rules, pausing now and then to spotlight specific costumes, interject vintage TV spots or cast shade on discontinued products \u2014 such as Growing Up Skipper, with her inflatable bust; pregnant Midge; or questionable-taste offerings like Sugar Daddy and Tanner, a flocked dog that poops plastic pellets.\n\nAlthough Robbie\u2019s blond-haired, fair-skinned Stereotypical Barbie seems to possess some abstract notion of herself as a toy, there\u2019s a major disconnect between inventor Ruth Handler\u2019s best intentions and the state of things in the Real World (where the movie spends roughly half its time): \u201cThanks to Barbie, all problems of feminism and equal rights have been solved,\u201d Mirren sarcastically summarizes. One evening, in the middle of a dance party, Stereotypical Barbie blurts out, \u201cYou guys ever think about dying?\u201d The next morning, she\u2019s horrified to find her feet have flattened and a patch of cellulite has appeared. What could be threatening her near-perfect physique?\n\nThe answer lies in the Real World, where Barbie and Ken (Gosling\u2019s Ken, not the ones played by Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, John Cena and others) steer her pink Corvette, emerging at Venice Beach wearing matching fluorescent Hot Skatin\u2019 ensembles. Yes, \u201cBarbie\u201d is one of those movies, like \u201cThe Smurfs\u201d and \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie,\u201d where imaginary characters cross over to modern-day America \u2014 just infinitely more clever. Instead of using the premise as a setup for slapstick, Gerwig shows Barbie defending herself when some random guy slaps her butt, getting a knuckle sandwich in return.\n\nThe script is no less on-the-nose about its politics, and in any case, Gerwig and Baumbach\u2019s social critiques seem more than reasonable. Their script merely emphasizes how lopsided the Real World remains in its treatment of women, up to and including Mattel\u2019s corporate headquarters, where a working mom named Gloria (America Ferrara) holds an entry-level job, while the boardroom is packed entirely with guys in suits. At the head of the table sits Will Ferrell in what is easily the film\u2019s laziest casting choice. (Hasn\u2019t he played a dozen versions of this character before, most obviously starring as Lord Business in \u201cThe Lego Movie\u201d?) Defaulting to Ferrell means passing up the chance to create a memorable original embodiment of the kind of men who run corporate America.\n\nAt the same time Barbie is experiencing her rude awakening, Ken\u2019s busy filling his empty head with all the possibilities that \u201cpatriarchy\u201d entails. In Barbie Land, Ken\u2019s job is a deliberately ill-defined afterthought (basically, just \u201cbeach\u201d), whereas in the Real World, dudes rule \u2014 an idea he takes back to Barbie Land with pointedly absurd results, brainwashing all the women into behaving like obedient housewives. The film\u2019s draggier second half gets both silly and unabashedly strident, as Stereotypical Barbie seeks help from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a damaged-goods doll with singed hair and messed-up makeup who serves as this girly-girl world\u2019s Morpheus-like sage.\n\nIt\u2019s upsetting (in a useful way) to see Barbie confronted with the overnight impact of rampant patriarchy, a concept that has rarely looked more off-putting than the frat-boy fantasy caricatured here. Think of it as the misogynist alternative marketed by old-school beer commercials, the polar opposite of Mattel\u2019s mid-\u201980s \u201cWe girls can do anything. Right, Barbie?\u201d campaign. While the Barbies plot to take back the government, Gerwig gives all the Ken dolls an over-the-top musical number, \u201cI\u2019m Just Ken,\u201d which is so amusingly self-involved it risks subverting the very point the movie\u2019s trying to make. If \u201cBarbie\u201d is all about centering and celebrating women, why let Ken steal the show?\n\nGosling is a good sport to play the slightly predatory, sartorially helpless pretty boy, as the spray-tanned ex-Mouseketeer parodies his popular \u201chey girl\u201d persona, flexing both his muscles and a range of facial expressions all but lacking from his recent work. If Robbie\u2019s Barbie sets an impossibly high bar for young women, then Gosling\u2019s Ken reps an equally formidable male model, with his chiseled abs and cheekbones.\n\nThat factor hasn\u2019t escaped Gerwig, who sets out to disrupt such unattainable aesthetic standards, calling out ways the doll\u2019s idealized design can harm self-esteem and encourage eating disorders. She crams most of that critique into a single motormouthed monologue, which drew cheers at the premiere and which, on closer inspection, contains not a single controversial idea. In the end, the trouble with \u201cBarbie\u201d isn\u2019t that it goes too far, but that it stops short, building to a conceptual scene between Barbie and her Creator (Rhea Perlman) that inadvertently underscores one of the movie\u2019s few failings: It\u2019s an intellectual experience, not an emotional one, grounded largely in audience nostalgia.\n\nThe power of nostalgia ought not be underestimated with a property like this, as much of Gerwig\u2019s approach skews toward grown women and gay audiences who\u2019ve owned the dolls \u2014 and for whom she\u2019s embedded deep-cut trivia and hidden references throughout. The movie was clearly made by people who understand how kids\u2019 imaginations work when playing with Barbies, even if Gerwig uses the project as the delivery device for what sounds like an undergraduate gender studies lecture at times. Most of its points are positive ones for young girls to hear, while those that earned the film its PG-13 rating will fly right over their heads as they feast on all the eye candy, including re-creations of classic looks by Jacqueline Durran (costumes) and Sarah Greenwood (production design).\n\nIt\u2019s kind of perfect that \u201cBarbie\u201d is opening opposite Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d since Gerwig\u2019s girl-power blockbuster offers a neon-pink form of inception all its own, planting positive examples of female potential for future generations. Meanwhile, by showing a sense of humor about the brand\u2019s past stumbles, it gives us permission to challenge what Barbie represents \u2014 not at all what you\u2019d expect from a feature-length toy commercial."

    "text": "\u201cI feel like I need to correct the record a little bit,\u201d Margot Robbie tells Rolling Stone.\n\nEarlier this year, the actress revealed to the world that she had a bit of a \u201cgoth phase\u201d and loved heavy metal when she was younger. But it was just one of many formative musical obsessions that shaped the Barbie star during her youth.\n\n\u201cI had my death-metal phase \u2014 and I do still like that \u2014 but I also like a lot of music,\u201d she continues.\n\nWhen Robbie was five, she became particularly obsessed with the Beach Boys thanks to a tape her family had. It was \u201call [she] would listen to.\u201d She was so devoted to the group that she even refused to listen to the Beatles.\n\n\u201cI had watched a documentary about how the Beach Boys would have been even more popular if the Beatles hadn\u2019t come along and stolen the limelight,\u201d she explains. The band had ties to Barbie\u2019s world just a few years before Robbie was born, with Brian Wilson having penned a tune called \u201cLiving Doll (Barbie)\u201d for the California Dream Barbie in 1987. Earlier this year, the Beach Boys\u2019 \u201cFun, Fun, Fun\u201d was featured in the Barbie trailer.\n\nAs a Nineties kid, Robbie also had a strong love for the pop music of that era. She begged Barbie director and co-writer Greta Gerwig to include the bubbly Aqua hit \u201cBarbie Girl\u201d in the film in some capacity. She also loved the Spice Girls, an impossible-to-avoid musical phenomenon for any young girl during that time.\n\n\u201cThe Spice Girls changed everything and dictated my version of second-wave feminism,\u201d Robbie says. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, my God, they wear little sparkly dresses and push-up bras, and then have a girl gang? That\u2019s what I want to be!\u2019\u201d (The Spice Girls inspired their own line of Barbie-like dolls, though those weren\u2019t official Barbie/Mattel toys.)\n\nRobbie entered her metal and emo era when she was a teenager, and though it didn\u2019t last forever, it still helped shape her eclectic taste. That taste has bled into her prolific acting career, as she often makes playlists for the characters she inhabits before stepping foot into their worlds. Trending Taylor Swift's 'Time' Cover Is Breaking Far-Right Brains Inside Trump\u2019s Plot to Corrupt the 2024 Election With \u2018Garbage\u2019 Data Adele Says She Almost 'Shat' Herself When Lady Gaga Attended Her Vegas Show Texas Threatens Doctors After Judge Says Woman Can Get Emergency Abortion\n\n\u201cI can anchor my character and myself in either a time period or a certain feeling,\u201d she explains. \u201cMusic is so helpful for that.\u201d\n\nThis interview was conducted prior to the actors strike."

    "text": "Life in plastic is fantastic, thanks in part to the hefty check Margot Robbie received for her role in Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cBarbie.\u201d\n\nThe Australian bombshell made $12.5 million for the Mattel film, according to a report from Variety, making her one of the highest-paid actresses of 2022.\n\nIn \u201cBarbie as The Island Princess,\u201d the OG tippy toes, tits up blonde imparts some unexpected poetry, \u201cLife is a sea I\u2019m sailing, riding the winds of time. Looking to find a course that is mine. Striving to find direction. Starting to understand, every wave\u2019s a part of the plan.\u201d\n\nRobbie is a moon child that\u2019s well versed in course setting, wind riding and sailing high on the waves of change. A girl who grew up building forts in her back yard and cut her teeth making Subway sandwiches in Melbourne, the two-time Academy Award-nominated actor made her star turn as Naomi Lapaglia, the mistress turned MILF of the century in Martin Scorsese \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street.\u201d\n\nMargot has since lent her prodigious talents to roles as far ranging as an unhinged comic book character, a vengeful figure skater, a silent film star, Sharon Tate and Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nThis summer, Robbie takes to the screen, drenched in pink and packed with moxie to play the titular role of \u201cBarbie.\u201d She stars opposite Ryan Gosling as Ken in Gerwig\u2019s live action imagining of the life, times and sudden conscious awakening of the iconic doll. How did the divine design of Robbie\u2019s birth chart prepare her for the role of a lifetime?\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t Margot vibe with her sun sign?\n\n5 Margot Robbie\u2019s sun is in the twelfth house of shadows and sabotage. Getty Images\n\nBorn July 2, 1990 at 7:45 AM down under time Robbie is a quintuple Cancer with a Scorpio moon and a heavy dose of planets in grind or die, if you build it they will pay, Capricorn. Robbie has some telling thoughts on her birth chart.\n\nShe revealed to \u201cW,\u201d magazine, \u201cI\u2019m a Cancer. But I don\u2019t really identify as a Cancer\u2026Everything I\u2019ve ever heard about Cancers doesn\u2019t sound like me: that they\u2019re very sensitive, wear their emotions on their sleeve, and are real homebodies. I hate being at home, I\u2019m not particularly sensitive, and I don\u2019t really wear my emotions on my sleeve.\u201d\n\nHow is it that a person with a FIVE PLACEMENT STELLIUM IN CANCER, including her ascendant, not feel like a Cancer? Because my dudes all of that cardinal water is pooling in Robbie\u2019s twelfth house of shadows, hidden matters, self-undoing and the unconscious mind and planets present in this house are not obvious to, or celebrated by the person in question.\n\nThe twelfth house is the domain of secrets, shame and other such things we are reluctant to show. Here, everything is shrouded, dimmed or buried. Thus, despite the heavy concentration of Cancer in her chart, the Cancer archetype and its stereotypes of a super sensitive, bleeding heart homebody don\u2019t resonate with Robbie.\n\nCounter to Cancer\n\n5 Margot Robbie wearing silver, the power color for her zodiac sign. Getty Images for Paramount Pictu\n\nIn terms of presentation, Cancer is ruled by the moon and true to her rising sign, Robbie\u2019s visage is luminous AF, looking as she does like an abalone bowl of holy water mixed with the resplendent dust of Cinderella\u2019s pulverized lost slipper.\n\nMany astrologers hold fast to the theory that as we age, we raise ourselves (or rise up) into our respective rising signs. In this sense, Robbie may begin to identify with her Cancer placements if and when she decides to become a mother.\n\nInterestingly, Robbie\u2019s husband is a Capricorn sun and while the two have yet to add children to their family, the \u2018build it\u2019 influence of their shared cardinal earth energy finds a home in LuckyChap Entertainment, the couple\u2019s join production company which in addition to producing \u201cBarbie,\u201d has brought \u201cI, Tonya,\u201d and \u201cPromising Young Woman,\u201d to the screen as well as the Hulu series \u201cDollface\u201d and the Netflix miniseries \u201cMaid\u201d to streaming services.\n\nRestriction and reward\n\n5 Margot Robbie\u2019s husband Thomas Ackerley is a Capricorn. Getty Images for Paramount Pictu\n\nTrue to her ascendant Robbie\u2019s visage is luminous AF, looking as she does like an abalone bowl full of holy water mixed with the resplendent dust of Cinderella\u2019s pulverized lost slipper.\n\nAnother feature of Robbie\u2019s birth chart that supports her struggle to identify with her Cancer placements is the presence of dad jeans planet Saturn directly opposing her rising sign.\n\nSaturn is known as a malefic planet and in Capricorn, the sign of its rulership, it\u2019s super charged and downright overpowering. Saturn constricts and limits what it touches and in the case of Robbie\u2019s ascendant, this equates to a suppression of the stereotypical expression of the Cancer archetype.\n\nThis could be why Robbie resists sitting still and staying home and is by her own admission, a distracted, disastrous cook. Robbie\u2019s ascendant is also weakened by the square aspect it forms to Mars, planet of drive and desire, in its home team sign of Aries.\n\nThis planetary placement is legitimately setting setting a match to the moody waters of Cancer and is likely to blame for Robbie\u2019s habit of setting her kitchen and her holiday hams on fire.\n\nScorpio at heart\n\n5 Margot Robbie\u2019s chart is heavily weighted towards water. John Phillips/Getty Images\n\nRobbie\u2019s moon is in the secret holding, power hoarding sign of Scorpio and as a Cancer rising the moon is her chart ruler. Scorpio is at once deeply emotional and fanatically private, they absolutely do not wear their emotions on their sleeves, preferring instead to hate whisper them into a tattered spider\u2019s web and bury them in a root cellar.\n\nThere\u2019s a real obsessive/possessive element to the Scorpio archetype, particularly for moon placements and it seems Robbie has channeled these twin tendencies in her approach to securing and performing roles, as she told \u201cBabylon\u201d director Damien Chazelle, \u201cI have to play this character\u2014she\u2019s mine.\u201d\n\nFurther, Robbie expressed something like grief, the provenance of Plutonian Scorpio, when she described the process of letting go of that role,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sad finishing every job. I always get attached to everyone in the film, and I sometimes get attached to certain characters.I think I poured so much of myself and my body and everything into this character that it kind of left me in pieces at the end of it. I didn\u2019t want it to end.\u201d\n\nNew York Post readers also love:\n\nBorn for Barbie\n\n5 Margot Robbie gives life to the plastic icon in \u201cBarbie.\u201d \u00a9Warner Bros\n\nScorpio is at once deeply emotional and fanatically private, they absolutely do not wear their emotions on their sleeves, preferring instead to hate whisper them into a tattered spider\u2019s web and bury them in a root cellar.\n\nIn terms of sun/moon combinations Cancer is about root systems and Scorpio is about shedding skin, burning boats and breaking ground to make way for what is yet to be; nostalgia and newness in an underwater tea party conversation. We see these two energies at work in Robbie\u2019s turn as Barbie, an iconoclastic reimagining of the doll who is loved and loathed in equal measure.\n\nRobbie\u2019s Barbie stays true to some of her traditions; mainly a banging wardrobe and a perennial effervescence while moving into a a more self-aware modern, Feminist modality. To be fair, there was a bit of female subversion from the midcentury jump; in a bold, beautiful inversion of the creation myth, Barbie came first and out of demand, in second place and in her plastic image, came Ken.\n\nRobbie\u2019s Barbie role is further supported by her Mars in Aries/Venus in Gemini. Mars is our planet of action and Venus the ruler of attraction, attachment and aesthetics. Mars in Aries lives for a challenge and in cahoots with a Scorpio moon is absolutely relentless in its pursuit of desire. Venus in Gemini craves constant intrigue and changing scenery. Apropos of this, Robbie told \u201cVogue,\u201d \u201cAll I want to do is live on a train,\u201d a perfect scenario for a Mars/Venus combo that is allergic to boredom and seeks always to be intellectually stimulated, physically on the move and ever on the make.\n\nOther casual indicators of Robbie Venus/Mars tango include our girl removing the brakes from her recreational roller skates and going off script to slap Leonardo DiCaprio during her \u201cWolf of Wall Street\u201d audition. That\u2019s air helping fire burn bright my babies, the quick instincts of Gemini and the fearlessness of Aries mixed with the psychic sway of Scorpio and the under the moody, moon drop shine of Cancer.\n\nAstrology 101: Your guide to the star\n\nAstrologer Reda Wigle researches and irreverently reports back on planetary configurations and their effect on each zodiac sign. Her horoscopes integrate history, poetry, pop culture and personal experience. She is also an accomplished writer who has profiled a variety of artists and performers, as well as extensively chronicled her experiences while traveling. Among the many intriguing topics she has tackled are cemetery etiquette, her love for dive bars, Cuban Airbnbs, a \u201cgirls guide\u201d to strip clubs and the \u201cweirdest\u201d foods available abroad."

Back in May, Cena described his casting as a \"happy accident,\" explaining that he and Robbie had a chance encounter that led to Robbie offering him a role in the upcoming \"Barbie\" movie. As Cena previously explained, he was in the midst of filming \"Fast X\" at the time, which was, coincidentally, across the street from where the \"Barbie\" production was set.\n\nOn \"Insight with Chris Van Vliet,\" Robbie, who stars as the title character and is also a producer on \"Barbie,\" provided more context on her aforementioned interaction with Cena.\n\n\"It happened while we were shooting in London,\" Robbie said. \"I ran into him at a restaurant and we'd worked together before. Actually, I ran into him because I went to pay the bill and they were like, 'John Cena already took care of it' and I was like, 'What? Where is he?' I mean he's a big guy, but I was like, 'He's hard to hide.'\""

    "text": "Throughout the press tour for Greta Gerwig\u2019s upcoming film Barbie, Margot Robbie has lived, breathed, and dressed as the iconic character. At this point, the two-time Oscar nominee is basically Barbie. But what if we told you she wasn\u2019t? Robbie and the cast of the film took a personality quiz to see which Barbie character they\u2019re most like in real life, and Robbie\u2019s reaction to her result was totally priceless.\n\nWhile chatting with Buzzfeed, Robbie, Kate McKinnon, America Ferrera, and Michael Cera scrolled through a series of oddly specific questions and prompts to identify which character they are from the movie. Parts of the quiz asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s a quality you look for in a friend?\u201d while others cued the cast to \u201cPick a color to paint your dreamhouse.\u201d Everyone\u2019s answers were, as you can see in the video below, fairly different. Then it was time for the big reveal.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe my results,\u201d Robbie said to her cast mates. \u201cI\u2019m Ken!\u201d Robbie\u2019s voice did have a tinge of disappoint to it. \u201cThis is how I felt when I did the Pottermore quiz to see which house I\u2019d be in,\u201d Robbie, a noted Hufflepuff, continued. Even after reading the description of the affable character, Robbie rejected her result that she is Ken, saying, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not!\u201d\n\nSlamming her phone face down on the Barbiecore pink sofa, Robbie pondered what response could have possibly given her Ken. Ultimately, though, we know Robbie is Barbie. Maybe the quiz just goes to show each of us has Kenergy within us all. Embrace the Kenergy, Margot! You are Kenough just the way you are!\n\nBefore you go, click here to see the best Barbiecore looks on the red carpet:\n\n"

    "text": "Margot Robbie is an Australian actor hailed as one of the biggest names in Hollywood. She owes her success to the brilliant characters she portrays in movies, which majorly contribute to her high net worth.\n\nRobbie was born in Dalby, Queensland, and started her acting career in Australia before moving to the US sometime in the early 2010s.\n\nIn just a decade, she has cemented her name as one of the most bankable stars in the industry. Her outstanding performances in films, such as I, Tonya (2017) and Bombshell (2019), and big-budget franchise movies of DC Extended Universe (DCEU) have turned Robbie into an instantly recognisable worldwide name from Japan to the American west coast.\n\nShe has also successfully added the tag of producer to her name as well as that of a businessperson, partnering with her husband, British filmmaker Tom Ackerley, on several acclaimed movies.\n\nInterestingly, Robbie is known for being an extremely private person. She is not on social media, having apparently deactivated her Instagram account sometime after announcing a break from social platforms in 2021. Her Facebook account has only a handful of posts, and most of them are related to her films, with the last post being from March 2018.\n\nMargot Robbie: A look at her career\n\nMargot Robbie started her acting career with the Australian TV series Neighbours (2008\u20132011, 2022). Her breakthrough role came with The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), and she has since gone on to lead major critically and commercially successful films, such as Z for Zachariah (2015), I, Tonya, Mary Queen of Scots (2018), Bombshell, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019) and Asteroid City (2023).\n\nHer portrayal of Harley Quinn in three DCEU films \u2014 Suicide Squad (2016), Birds of Prey (2020) and The Suicide Squad (2021) \u2014 has been hailed universally by fans of the iconic DC comic book character.\n\nShe has garnered two Academy Award nominations, four Golden Globe nominations and five BAFTA nominations so far. She has also been recognised by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2017.\n\nHow much does Margot Robbie earn from films?\n\nCelebrity wealth tracker Celebrity Net Worth estimates Margot Robbie may have a net worth of USD 40 million.\n\nMuch of this is obviously because of her film career. But it is not clear how much she may have made from the movies she has been a part of as an actor or producer in the earlier years.\n\nCommenting about her stint in Neighbours, she told Vanity Fair in 2014 that she \u201csaved up enough to get me through three years unemployed.\u201d Some reports suggest that she was paid somewhere around USD 350,000 for The Wolf of Wall Street and almost double that figure two years later for Z for Zachariah.\n\nBut by 2019, she was listed by Forbes as one of the highest-paid actresses in the world with total earnings of USD 23.5 million. The publication noted that a prime reason behind her income was the eight-figure upfront earnings from Birds of Prey of which she was also a producer.\n\nHer income in recent years is better known, especially for Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie \u2014 one of the most-anticipated films of 2023.\n\nRobbie plays the titular character, who is based on the world-famous Mattel doll, and stars alongside Ryan Gosling, who plays Ken. The film also has a larger A-list star cast, including Dua Lipa, Emma Mackey, Simu Liu, Ncuti Gatwa and John Cena, playing different versions of Barbie and Ken. The film also stars America Ferrera, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, Rhea Perlman, and Will Ferrell.\n\nAccording to multiple reports both Robbie and Gosling have been paid USD 12.5 million each for Barbie. It is not clear if Robbie or any of the other actors have a share in the profits of the film, similar to how some A-list stars, such as Tom Cruise, the star of Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One (2023), do in their cases.\n\nNevertheless, Robbie serves as one of the producers of the film. This means her overall paycheck from Barbie will be much higher than her acting fees of USD 12.5 million.\n\nMargot Robbie\u2019s endorsements and businesses\n\nThe face of Calvin Klein and Chanel\n\nRobbie became the face of Calvin Klein\u2019s Deep Euphoria fragrance in 2016. The scent has cascalone and mandarin leaf as its top notes; black rose and geranium, among others, as middle tones; and patchouli and musk as base notes.\n\nShe became a brand ambassador of Chanel in 2018 and since then has worn the brand\u2019s dresses for most of her public appearances. However, it is unclear if she continues to be the brand ambassador of the luxury fashion brand, as Robbie has been seen wearing a series of Bottega Veneta creations in November 2022.\n\nThough she picked a Chanel for her 2023 Golden Globes appearance, she was seen in a Valentino at the London premiere of her film Babylon and wore Bottega Veneta in January 2023.\n\nBe it Calvin Klein, Chanel or Bottega Veneta, details of the deal in each of them are not known.\n\nNissan electric\u2019s ambassador\n\nRobbie was named Nissan\u2019s first electric vehicle ambassador by the Japanese auto giant in February 2017. As part of the promotional event, which was held in Monaco, Robbie went behind the wheels of a Nissan BladeGilder concept car and raced it down the streets.\n\nIn her role as Nissan Electric Vehicle Ambassador, Robbie said, \u201cOur lives are literally turning electric, but the sad fact is that so many people around the world still don\u2019t have access to a reliable source of electricity at all.\u201d\n\nSome months later, a 2018 Daily Mail report cited a publicist saying that Robbie would be paid around USD 1 million over a period of two years as part of her ambassadorship.\n\nMargot Robbie\u2019s production company\n\nMargot Robbie co-founded the production company LuckyChap Entertainment with Tom Ackerley and some of their friends in 2014.\n\nThe production house has since released critically and commercially successful movies such as I, Tonya (2017), Promising Young Woman (2020) and Boston Strangler (2023), headlined by Robbie, Carey Mulligan and Keira Knightley, respectively.\n\nThrough her company, Robbie is also the producer of Barbie whose total production budget is an estimated USD 100 million.\n\nPapa Salt gin\n\nAlong with Tom Ackerley and industry friends, Charlie Maas, Josey McNamara and Regan Riskas, Margot Robbie used her net worth to co-found a new line of gin, Papa Salt, in May 2023.\n\nMade in Byron Bay \u2014 a coastal town in New South Wales, Australia \u2014 the gin is reportedly inspired by the east coast of Australia. The brand\u2019s website calls it an \u201ceasy-drinking gin that celebrates the subtle taste of native Australian botanicals.\u201d\n\nThe official site also reveals that the founders experimented with 59 recipes before coming to the right combination for Papa Gin. It has notes of zesty wax flower, hibiscus and citrus peel as well as nutty wattleseed, pink peppercorn and a hint of oyster shell.\n\nExpensive things Margot Robbie owns\n\nCar collection\n\nUnlike most other celebrities, it is difficult to find out the exact cars that Margot Robbie owns. While several reports say that she owns a Mercedes-Benz CLA, a Ford Explorer, a Mercedes G63 AMG and an Audi A6, among other cars, little can be ascertained about them.\n\nRobbie has hardly ever been seen in them and, unlike Henry Cavill who posts pictures of his rides on social media, she never talked about four-wheelers while she was active.\n\nHowever, older pictures show that she has at least owned a Hyundai Excel, a predecessor of the Hyundai Accent. During its production run from 1985 to 1999, the Hyundai Excel was one of the most affordable cars but had features that were found in more expensive cars of its kind. Pictures suggest that Robbie drove a green Hyundai Excel. It is not clear if she still owns it.\n\nThe other car that she has been seen in is a Cadillac Escalade. Made by American automaker General Motors, the Cadillac Escalade is a full-size SUV, a favourite among celebrities. A 2023 model of the car starts at around USD 81,000 and can go up to USD 151,000. Depending on the variant, it can either have a 6.2L V8 engine or a 6.2L Supercharged V8 engine. It has a top speed of just over 200 km/h.\n\nSome reports indicate that she also owns a Nissan LEAF electric vehicle, which might make sense since she is a brand ambassador of the car brand. In fact, the Daily Mail report from December 2018 says that a publicist revealed she would likely be gifted a car by Nissan when she signed up to be their face.\n\nA 2023 Nissan LEAF goes up to 340 km on a full charge on the back of its 40 kWh battery, which can be increased to 60 kWh. The starting price of the electric car is USD 28,000.\n\nReal estate\n\nIn a short span of time, Margot Robbie strengthened her net worth on the back of smart investments in a real estate portfolio that helps her live comfortably in both the US and her home country of Australia.\n\nOne of Robbie\u2019s best-known homes is located in the Venice Beach neighbourhood of Los Angeles. It was bought by the actor in around October 2019 for USD 5 million, shortly after she was named by Forbes as one of the world\u2019s highest-paid female actors.\n\nThe property has three separate structures on a double-wide lot, the exact size of which is unknown. It is built like a fortress and has its own gate, alarm systems and CCTV cameras. Besides the main building, it has a two-bedroom separate structure and a cottage-style third structure. There is a three-car garage on the property as well.\n\nIn mid-2021, when parts of the property were still under construction, TMZ reported that its total worth will be an estimated USD 15 million.\n\nBesides her US address, Robbie is believed to own a home in Byron Bay. It was bought by her in 2018 for around USD 3 million. Australian media reports from the time suggest that she indeed had a look at the property located in Linnaeus Estate, which was a private gated beachfront estate, between Byron Bay and Lennox Head.\n\nThe timber-lined property is situated next to a beach. It has an all-white interior, large kitchen and designer bathroom, as well as a treehouse-like alfresco deck that extends out of the main building into the greenery-covered ground of the property.\n\nIn May 2023, Robbie and Ackerley reportedly took a look at another Byron Bay property. Reports say that the property, named Cedar Hill, is described as one of the \u2018most beautiful homes\u2019 in the country. It is situated around 10 km south of Byron Bay in a secluded place called Newrybar.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Amir Prestige (@amirprestigegroup)\n\nIt was last sold in 2019 for around USD 1.6 million, but records indicate that another USD 2 million was spent on its redevelopment.\n\nThe barn-style main building sits on 20,000 square metres. It has eight bedrooms and as many bathrooms, along with an open-style kitchen, living and dining areas. It comes with custom-designed furniture, such as a 16-chair dining table and sofas covered in bohemian textiles. The house has an infinity pool, too. Glass, concrete, recycled timber and natural stone among other materials have been used in its construction.\n\nIn 2019, Robbie spent around USD 2 million on two adjoining homes on Gold Coast in Southport, Queensland. They were bought for her mother, Sarie Kessler, and older sister, Anya Robbie. Each property has two bedrooms, three bathrooms and a garage.\n\nFive years before the dual purchase, she had also paid off her mother\u2019s mortgage on their family home on Gold Coast. The family home was originally bought in 2007 by Sarie for around USD 300,000. It had four bedrooms, three bathrooms and a backyard pool. Some years after its mortgage was paid off, the Robbie family sold off the house.\n\nAmong her previous accommodations is a 312.5-square-metre home in a 603-square-metre plot in Hancock Park, a suburb of Los Angeles in California. It was one of the first major properties that the actor added to her portfolio. Robbie bought it in 2017, shortly after her marriage to Ackerley and their move to the US from London.\n\nThe two-floor home, built in 2016, is quite modest. It has four bedrooms, all decked in white walls and five-and-half bathrooms. A huge black chandelier hangs over a blue round sofa in the family room, which also has a fireplace. Just outside the huge floor-to-ceiling glass window of the room is the property\u2019s outdoor pool, which has a low, yellow diving board.\n\nIn the kitchen is a Carrara marble sink and a six-seat counter. On the second floor is the master bedroom with a private balcony. The property also has a boutique wine cellar, spa, patio with a bar and pool bath, and an open-air cabana.\n\nRobbie paid around USD 2.7 million for the property when she bought it. In May 2021, she sold the property for around USD 3.5 million.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Luxury Real Estate (@cleverestates)\n\nIn 2018, Robbie paid USD 950,000 to buy a house owned by Milk (2008) director Dustin Lance Black in Hollywood Heights in Los Angeles. Robbie bought the property as an investment and is, therefore, believed to have never lived in it. Originally built in the 1950s, the actual size of the two-bedroom and one-bath home is 88 square metres.\n\nRobbie commissioned a restoration work on the property, following which the walls and the furnishings were given new colours and fittings. Right behind the property are two terraces that are built into a hillside and have enough space for seating. The uppermost terrace overlooks the house and gives a fantastic view of the neighbourhood.\n\nReports suggest that the house was immediately put on rent for USD 5,000 per month after Robbie bought it. In December 2020, she put it up for sale for USD 1.2 million.\n\n(Hero image: IMDb; Featured image: Courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures/Courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures \u2013 \u00a9 2023 Warner Bros.

    "text": "It's official: Margot Robbie is the real-life Barbie we all needed in our lives\u2014and, no, not because she has an impeccable wardrobe. Or because of her ability to shape-shift into a range of different characters. And not even because she just gave us an up-close-and-personal tour of the Dreamhouse for the upcoming Greta Gerwig film. Right now we consider her a living doll\u2014and a role model who is the opposite of plastic\u2014because of her incredible generosity.\n\nFans recently unearthed an old clip of Margot Robbie detailing how she paid off her mom's mortgage as soon as she could afford it\u2014and if you didn't love the Barbie star already, you certainly will now. \"When I first started working and I was speaking with a business manager, they said, 'You should invest your money, what do you want to with your money?'\" she explains in the 2014 clip. \"And I was like, 'First thing I want is to pay off my mum's mortgage.'\"\n\nWhile that major money goal didn't happen overnight, she stuck to her promise and pocketed away a portion of her paychecks for movies like the Wolf of Wall Street. She added: \"Every couple of months, I'd check in and be like, 'Do we have enough?'\" Eventually, she saved up enough, did all the necessary paperwork, and paid for the $490,000 mortgage in honor of her mother's 60th birthday. \"It's what any kid dreams of doing for their parent,\" Robbie says. \"It was a big secret to be sitting on for so long, but definitely one of the best moments of my life.\"\n\nWe're not crying, you're crying\u2014and you're not alone here. One commenter gushed, \"What a lovely person. \"Margot is a walking green flag,\" another fan wrote. \"Everything is good about her.\" A third viewer kept it simple: \"Margot, the truest Barbie.\"\n\nOf course, Robbie isn't the only celebrity to pay her good fortune forward. Jackie Chan is reportedly donating every dollar of his $400 million net worth to charity, while stars including Allison Janney and Heidi Klum have appeared on Celebrity IOU their inner circle to home renovations. It all goes to show you that\u2014just like Barbie\u2014kindness never goes out of style."

    "text": "July 07, 2023 04:30 pm | Updated 05:53 pm IST\n\nYes, Damien Chazelle\u2019s love-letter to Hollywood is over three hours long, but it does zip by in a hectic cavalcade of colourful excess. While it might be empty calories and gratuitous especially in the nudity department, fast food (once in a while) is fun, no? Carrying on the fast food analogy, continued consumption could make you sick and there is much in Babylon that could make you nauseous, including projectile vomiting and hawking great gobs of saliva (ugh).\n\nThough Babylon has the scale for the big screen, watching it on a streaming platform gives you the choice of taking a break and watching cement dry or something and then returning to the sensory riot.\n\nBabylon Director: Damien Chazelle Cast: Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, Diego Calva, Jean Smart, Jovan Adepo, Li Jun Li Story line: How a young immigrant rises up the studio ranks to become an executive and the characters that help or hinder him on his path Run time: 189 minutes\n\nThe term \u2018Babylon,\u2019 like Kandahar and Samarkand, is evocative, a shorthand for arts, culture, oppression and excess. Fun fact; the Bible refers to Babylon as Babel, and Brad Pitt, who kills it as silent movie star Jack Conrad in Babylon, also featured in Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s Oscar-winning Babel (2006).\n\nBack to Babylon, which opens in 1926 Bel-Air, with Manny (Diego Calva), trying to convince a truck driver to transport an elephant to a studio executive\u2019s party. Those first 30-bacchanalian-minutes introduce all the major players in the story and set the tone. Apart from Conrad and Manny, there is brash, aspiring starlet Nellie LaRoy (Margot Robbie), risqu\u00e9 cabaret singer Lady Fay Zhu (Li Jun Li), the trumpeter Sidney Palmer (Jovan Adepo) and gossip writer Elinor St. John (Jean Smart).\n\nNellie is discovered as she dances in wild abandon as the replacement for an actor who overdosed at the party. Hollywood is in a state of flux with silent movies being replaced by talkies. The change affects the players differently. Manny is all about solutions and he is able to adapt to the changing scenario; Conrad, Nellie and Fay not so much.\n\nThere are drug dealers (like aspiring actor The Count (Rory Scovel) who sells drugs in peanuts), copious amounts of alcohol and copulation, rattlesnake fights, accidental deaths, heads stuck in toilet bowls, gangsters, chained alligators and suicides. There are also quieter moments with the one where Elinor dissects the ephemerality of stardom for a befuddled Conrad being pragmatic and poignant in equal measure.\n\nThough the screenplay is not as tight as it could have been \u2014 Babylon plays out like a loose string of audacious scenes \u2014 the razor-sharp editing, sumptuous costumes and to-die-for music transport you into a psychedelic fever dream.\n\nThe acting is a scorcher. Pitt is on point as the talented, good natured but ultimately ineffectual Conrad. Robbie is like an Energizer bunny as Nellie, \u201cthe maelstrom of bad taste and sheer magic\u201d as Ina (Olivia Wilde), Conrad\u2019s ex wife comments. She fizzes with ideas, talent, a brash sexiness and a self-destructive streak. Tobey Maguire is riveting as manic mob boss James McKay, as is Max Minghella as producer Irving Thalberg. Samara Weaving weighs in as Nellie\u2019s rival Constance Moore, who Nellie leaves far behind.\n\nApart from the montage at the end of the film, which drags you out of your drug-induced thrill ride, quite like the man from Porlock, and the dreadful blurring of body parts under the guise of censorship, Babylon is an eyeball-searing trip into a version of writer-director Chazelle\u2019s Hollywood.\n\nBabylon is currently streaming on Amazon Prime Video"

America Ferrera plays a human with a deep love for the iconic toy, Kate McKinnon plays Weird Barbie, Issa Rae plays President Barbie and Michael Cera plays Allan (based on a short-lived Mattel doll.)\n\nEntertainment reporter Kim Holcomb talked to the actors in Los Angeles.\n\nHOLCOMB: \"You\u2019re both professionals, but the first time you saw each other in the roller blading outfits, what was your actual reaction?\"\n\nGOSLING: \"It's all just a neon haze to me.\"\n\nROBBIE: \"It was both hilarious and mortifying at the same time.\"\n\nGOSLING: \"Margot had brought her Australian family\u2026\u201d\n\nROBBIE: \u201cWe're not bringing this up\u2026\u201d\n\nGOSLING: \u201cAnd they were very disappointed in my rollerblading skills.\"\n\nROBBIE: \"It was just my Aunt Jackie.\u201d\n\nGOSLING: \u201cI was fixated on that. In a way, it helped me, it gave me a focal point through the storm.\"\n\nROBBIE: \"That was the one day on the set where I could do something just a tiny bit better than you.\u201d\n\nGOSLING: \u201cOh. She\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nHOLCOMB: \"Kate, am I correct in assuming you were cast, in part, because you're so limber?\"\n\nMCKINNON: \"Having studied dance for my entire life and being able to fully lift my leg over and around my head, that's mainly why I was cast. And I was told that. (laughter) No, I'm not limber and the splits you may see in the film are fake. I can go about two feet.\"\n\nHOLCOMB: \u201cEveryone is talking about Barbie energy and Ken-rgy. What is Allan energy?\"\n\nCERA: \u201cAllan is sort of a sad figure, he sort of exists in a nether space, in limbo. So it's not the kind of energy you want to inhabit. It's sort of a repellent energy.\"\n\nHOLCOMB: \u201cWhat is Gloria energy?\u201d\n\nFERRERA: \"She's a grown woman and she loves Barbie. And you know what? She's not apologizing for it\u2026 we all have relationships to what we loved and what we believed in and what inspired us as children, and at what point do our perspectives on those things really shift and change? And also, what do we get to keep? Like, how much magic do we get to keep in our lives?\"\n\nHOLCOMB: \"Ryan, I have to say your performance many times reminded me of my son when he was, like, six. Did someone inspire those parts of your performance?\u201d\n\nGOSLING: \u201cMy kids, for sure. But a lot of it was just sort of - I don't know what happened, honestly.\"\n\nROBBIE: \"I think part of the humor is seeing two grown adults having full-on tantrums like they're 3-year-olds\u2026 this movie is bizarre - it goes to a lot of places - but us acting ridiculous is prevalent throughout.\"\n\nHOLCOMB: \u201cDid you take home a souvenir?\u201d\n\nRAE: \u201cI was given a souvenir, they made us this amazing Barbie book. And I took the printed script, because it was like super top secret and let me tell you, that script - they sent it to you in an app, and I screen shot a page, and it just completely shut down.\u201d\n\nCERA: \u201cOh, really?\u201d\n\nRAE: \u201cCompletely shut down, and they were like, \u2018Excuse me, don't ever do that again.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry!\u2019 It was an accident, I didn\u2019t even want the page\u2026 but then they gave a printed script on set and I took that as a souvenir.\u201d"

    "text": "Fans are becoming increasingly convinced that Margot Robbie\u2019s Barbie will be a lesbian, as promotion for the pastel pink, plastic and fantastic film reaches its crescendo.\n\nWe\u2019re less than three short weeks away from Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie finally landing in cinemas on 21 July, yet fans are still not crystal clear on what the plot will entail.\n\nWe\u2019ve been gifted with several trailers, and from what fans can glean, Margot Robbie\u2019s Barbie will face the harrowing experience of losing her doll-like perfection \u2013 that means flat feet, cold showers and the inability to gracefully float down from her Dreamhouse each morning.\n\nAlongside bleach blonde babe Ken (Ryan Gosling), she\u2019ll have to travel into the real world to discover the truth about why her Barbie fantasy is falling apart at the seams.\n\nIt\u2019s an intentionally vague plot, with director Gerwig only dropping hints that the film was inspired by \u201cdisco\u201d music and \u201ctechnicolour musicals like The Wizard of Oz\u201c.\n\nOne plot point that is clear, though, is this is a film about Barbies \u2013 not Kens. In addition to Robbie\u2019s Barbie, there\u2019s Dua Lipa as Mermaid Barbie, Emma Mackey as Physicist Barbie, Issa Rae as President Barbie, and Hari Nef as Doctor Barbie, to name but a few.\n\nOn the Ken side of things, on the other hand, there\u2019s Ryan Gosling as just Ken, Ncuti Gatwa as just Ken, Simu Liu as just Ken, etc.\n\nYou may like to watch\n\nIt\u2019s evident that in Barbieland, men aren\u2019t s**t.\n\nNow Barbie obsessors and sleuths have hooked onto a new theory that Robbie\u2019s leading lady will actually be even more uninterested in men than the trailer makes out.\n\nWhy do fans think Barbie is a lesbian?\n\nWell, the first reason is her apparent complete and utter disinterest in spending any time with Ken at all.\n\nIn the trailer, we see her leave Barbieland and embark on her mission of entering the real world, and she doesn\u2019t appear to have told Ken where she\u2019s off to \u2013 until he pops up in the back of her car.\n\nIn another part of the trailer, Ken suggests staying over at Barbie\u2019s house, and though they both have no idea what they\u2019re supposed to do as boyfriend and girlfriend, it\u2019s clear that she\u2019s not interested in anything physical.\n\nHowever, eagle-eyed fans have picked up on a striking bit of chemistry between Barbie and another lead character instead: Gloria, played by Ugly Betty star America Ferrera, a Mattel employee who tracks Barbie down in the real world.\n\nIn one clip, when Gloria urges Barbie to jump into her car, the pair engage in what can only be described as a very longing stare.\n\nfinally getting my pink barbie girl lesbian rep??? pic.twitter.com/3u8NsJSAJJ \u2014 ellie (@C0MMANDERLEXAS) June 26, 2023\n\nWith the release date creeping ever closer, the rumour mill has only picked up the pace.\n\nMargot Robbie and America Ferrera have taken part in several interviews together, with one clip in particular sending sapphics everywhere into a tailspin.\n\nDuring a conversation with ticketing company Fandango, the interviewer questioned why Robbie once thought the film would never see the light of day.\n\n\u201cThe script was \u2026 when I read it, I thought, this is genius, and they\u2019re never going to let us make it, what a shame, this is all going to go to waste,\u201d Robbie explained.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just that the movie is unexpected, I think it\u2019s like, Greta kind of pushes in directions that I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d let us go in.\u201d\n\nthe way i\u2019m literally convinced Barbie is gonna be a lesbian pic.twitter.com/gLDUQI4Z1r \u2014 marissa (@poeticinemaa) June 28, 2023\n\ni\u2019m telling y\u2019all this barbie is a lesbian https://t.co/hgTXXPCrGw \u2014 olivia piraino (@olivetapenade_) June 27, 2023\n\nthey\u2019ve got a hit on their hands if barbie is a lesbian pic.twitter.com/VRefJoPuqq \u2014 ria. tea\u2019s wife (REAL) (@sapphcore) June 26, 2023\n\nDuring the same interview, Ferrara said that the film wanted to explore \u201chow to bring Barbie into the 21st century\u201d.\n\nIf that\u2019s not enough to convince you, elsewhere in the conversation, the group spoke about how they used to play with Barbie dolls as a kid \u2013 with Robbie suggesting she played with her dolls by \u201cbanging them together\u201d.\n\nFerrara responded with a laugh, and a cheeky, knowing glance.\n\nWhile there\u2019s absolutely no confirmation that Barbie will be made into a sapphic icon, that hasn\u2019t stopped the people of the internet from jumping for joy at the mere prospect.\n\nI am officially a lesbian Barbie truther \u2014 Sabrina (3am Edition) (@cascade_waves) July 1, 2023\n\nwait what if ken turns into the villain when he finds out barbie is actually a lesbian but during his redemption arc he finds out he is actually just pretty gay too???

    "text": "It's official. Or maybe it is not yet. But as per projections, Margot Robbie-led upcoming Barbie movie is on track to defeat Christopher Nolan's biopic-thriller Oppenheimer at the box office. As per Deadline, Barbie, based on Mattel's fashion toy, is tracking for an impressive sum of $80 to $100 million in its opening weekend. This is double the projected collections of Oppenheimer. For months now, film buffs have been eagerly awaiting the release of both movies to see which one comes out on top. While Barbie was always considered to have more value for commercial moviegoers, it is wise never to underestimate Nolan, whose movie releases are events unto themselves.\n\nThus far, though, it appears the Greta Gerwig directorial will win. Both movies, it must be noted, have a production budget of $100 million. What is Barbie all about?\n\nBarbie and Ken, having faced expulsion from the idyllic Barbie Land due to their imperfections, embark on an adventure of self-exploration in the realm of reality. The official synopsis of the film reads, \"To live in Barbie Land is to be a perfect being in a perfect place. Unless you have a full-on existential crisis. Or you\u2019re a Ken.\" Directed by Greta Gerwig and written by her and her filmmaker husband Noah Baumbach, the film has a huge cast with well-known names, including Will Ferrell, Kate McKinnon, Michael Cera, Emma Mackey, America Ferrera, Alexandra Shipp, Ariana Greenblatt, Emerald Fennell, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Sharon Rooney, Anna Cruz Kanye, Ritu Arya, Conor Swindell, Jamie Demetriou, Marisa Abela, Issa Rae, Hari Nef, and Ncuti Gatwa.\n\nWhat is Oppenheimer all about?\n\nNolan's star-studded film follows the life and times of one J Robert Oppenheimer, an American theoretical physicist who is called the \"father of the atomic bomb\" for his contribution to the Manhattan Project, which led to the invention of the atomic bomb. Cillian Murphy essays the role of Oppenheimer. But the film has a veritable army of big names in the supporting cast, including Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Rami Malek, Florence Pugh, Benny Safdie, Michael Angarano, Josh Hartnett and Kenneth Branagh.\n\nBoth Barbie and Oppenheimer will release on July 21.\n\nWATCH WION LIVE HERE"

    "text": "Margot Robbie has a dream life. I mean, she's already a bonafide superstar and is soon set to star in the biggest summer blockbuster of all time, Greta Gerwig's Barbie. But with all good career milestones comes some personal balance, which she very much has, thanks to her solid marriage with her husband, Tom Ackerley.\n\nBut just who is Tom, and how did he capture the heart of one of the most in-demand actresses of our generation? Well, it's been ten years since the lovebirds first met on the set of a film, with their friendship quickly developing into a romance and, years later, a low-key, intimate wedding in her native Australia.\n\nProving that they are destined to be together at all costs, the pair has also forged a successful working relationship thanks to the production company they founded together in 2014.\n\nJon Kopaloff\n\nWith the duo being undeniably strong from the get-go, it's safe to say that little is known about the British film producer, 33, who won the heart of the 32-year-old Wolf of Wall Street icon. So, to learn more about the husband of Margot Robbie read on.\n\nHow did Margot meet Tom?\n\nThe pair met in 2013 on the set of Suite Fran\u00e7aise, in which Margot played the role of Celine Joseph and Tom worked behind the scenes as the third assistant director.\n\nThey first became best friends but began dating the following year. However, that wasn't before some concern on Margot's end, as she wasn't necessarily looking for something serious at the time, and she didn't want to make things weird between them if he didn't reciprocate her feelings.\n\n\"I was the ultimate single gal. The idea of relationships made me want to vomit,\" the Australian actress said in an interview with Vogue. \"And then this crept up on me. We were friends for so long. I was always in love with him, but I thought, 'Oh, he would never love me back. Don't make it weird, Margot. Don't be stupid and tell him that you like him.' And then it happened, and I was like, 'Of course, we're together. This makes so much sense, the way nothing has ever made sense before.'\"\n\nNeedless to say, Margot and Tom knew they were meant for each other, and they also knew they would work well in a professional setting, which allowed them to start LuckyChap Entertainment with their friends Josey McNamara and Sophia Kerr.\n\nWhen did Tom and Margot get married?\n\nThe couple has always been keen on keeping things low-key and never made news of their engagement official. They secretly tied the knot in a private ceremony in Byron Bay, New South Wales, in December 2016, with Margot later confirming the news on Instagram."

I say 'guess who used to live in my flat'.\n\n\"Most people get it because if you live in Clapham, you know she used to live there.\n\n\"They say 'that's what they all say, that Margot Robbie used to live at my flat'. It's a story to tell people.\"\n\nDavid D, 28, who moved into the house two years ago, said: \"I didn't know that she had lived here until I moved in.\n\n\"It was a few weeks after when some of my housemates said about it and had messaged to say this is Margot Robbie's house.

Maybe one of us will follow in their footsteps!\"\n\nFashion worker Sam G, 26, from Wales, and Irish lad Jordan, 28, complete the current gang.\n\nDespite now living among the glitz and glamour of LA, pictures of Margot's Clapham group suggest a hard-drinking lifestyle and a \"party\" house rep back in 2014.\n\nMargot previously described having a \"24-hour party for my 24th birthday\" on Jimmey Kimmel Live where she \"ended up back in our courtyard and popped another bottle of champagne\".\n\n\"Our house is definitely a party house like theirs was,\" David said.\n\n\"There was a bit of a rep and obviously it's a side terrace house with a big back garden and lots of room to bring people around.\n\n\"We've tried to keep up that rep as much as we can.\"\n\nThere has also been gossip that the Aussie could return to the house and reminisce on her boozier days.\n\n\"There was one story where the previous tenants were asked by Margot if she could rent the house for the weekend to have a party,\" Alice said.\n\n\"I think they all had to move out for the weekend, so didn't take her up on the offer. I wish she would call us!\"\n\nDavid added: \"I did hear there were rumours of a garden gnome that she had wanted to come back to see back in 2019.\"\n\n7 Almost a decade later, four average Joes now occupy the same brick and mortar Credit: David D - Supplied"

A recent video posted by Architectural Digest featuring Australian actress Margot Elise Robbie, who will be playing the role of Barbie, gives us a tour of the entire production and what went on behind the scenes of this fascinating set. Barbie Dream House(Architectural Digest)\n\nThe entire basis and theme of the setup were done on \u2018Pink, and it truly gives the viewers an experience of bringing the animated sequel to life. In the video tour of the Barbie Dream House, we get a glimpse of the house, which consists of the entrance at the very beginning of the video, which is later opened by Barbie herself (Margot Robbie). As the tour progresses, we get an insight into how the entire set is made and what thought went into bringing the whole idea of Barbie to life.\n\nStay tuned with breaking news on HT Channel on Facebook. Join Now\n\nThe Movie gives an overview of Barbie coming to the human world and facing the challenges of convincing people that she's actually Barbie, and the problems eventually build on top of what the trailers have showcased so far. So to conclude, the movie wouldn't really be presented much in the Barbie universe, but this shows the amount of effort and planning that has gone into the integral segments of the movie.\n\nThe Dream House is inspired by Palm Springs, and hence we can see a lot of attributes with respect to the sunsets they used in the backdrop of the set, and the way they have added onto palm trees to bring in the little tropical aspect makes the buildup very detailed and interesting.\n\nWhen the Barbie merchandise first hit the market, it was a big success, and we also saw the versatility of the merchandise in terms of its outfit and display. There was a Barbie for every occasion and outfit, and this keeps the team and production of Barbie up to the same level of flexibility in order to make the movie more connecting to the audience."

    "text": "Margot Robbie is raking in big Barbie bucks.\n\nThe 33-year-old star of Barbie, who also produced the film, is expected to earn $50 million as part of a deal that combines her salary and back-end box office bonuses, according to Variety, which cited multiple sources. Her husband Tom Ackerley is also a producer on the film.\n\nReps for Warner Bros. and Robbie did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's requests for comment.\n\nBarbie has so far surpassed $1 billion at the worldwide box office, making Greta Gerwig the highest-grossing female director of a live-action movie at the global box office, per The Hollywood Reporter. It topped 2019's Captain Marvel, which was co-directed by Anna Boden.\n\nRobbie produced Barbie with her company LuckyChap Entertainment, which previously produced Birds of Prey and the Oscar-winning Promising Young Woman.\n\nAmerica Ferrera, Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig. Han Myung-Gu/WireImage\n\nShe hand-picked Gerwig to direct and co-write the project with Gerwig's real-life partner Noah Baumbach. Originally, Robbie wanted Gal Gadot to play Barbie before Gerwig convinced her to take the part.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that I ever wanted to play Barbie, or dreamt of being Barbie, or anything like that. This is going to sound stupid, but I really didn\u2019t even think about playing Barbie until years into developing the project,\" Robbie told Vogue in May.\n\nBefore Barbie achieved its box-office milestone, which the film clinched just over two weeks after its release, Robbie told Collider that she pitched Barbie as a film that could make $1 billion.\n\n\"I think my pitch in the green-light meeting was the studios have prospered so much when they\u2019re brave enough to pair a big idea with a visionary director,\" she said to the outlet.\n\nAn example she gave while \"naming anything that\u2019s been incredible and made a ton of money for the studios over the years\" was \"dinosaurs and [Steven] Spielberg,\" aka 1993's Jurassic Park, which launched a movie franchise.\n\nNever miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nMargot Robbie and Tom Ackerley.

And I think I told them that it\u2019d make a billion dollars, which maybe I was overselling, but we had a movie to make, okay?\" she joked in the interview, before the film ended up making good on that promise.\n\nBarbie revitalized the movie theater business this summer, thanks also in part to the internet's viral \"Barbenheimer\" trend, challenging fans to see both Barbie and Christopher Nolan's three-hour historical drama Oppenheimer. The two films opened in theaters on the same weekend, breaking moviegoing records together.\n\n\n\nBarbie is in theaters now.\n\n"

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom mandatory pink days to cups of special tea, Margot Robbie was committed to her role as Barbie.\n\nSo it should come as no surprise that, even during a \"Barbie\" cast plank challenge, Robbie came out on top.\n\nLondon-based personal trainer David Higgins, who worked with the cast during filming, shared a photo he took with Robbie in front of the challenge's results on his website.\n\nWhile the photo showed that he held the top spot with a plank that lasted five minutes and 32 seconds, Robbie wasn't far behind after holding her plank for four minutes and 10 seconds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe beat out costars Ryan Gosling (three minutes and two seconds), Hari Nef (two minutes and 15 seconds), and her husband Tom Ackerley, who clocked in at one minute and 36 seconds.\n\nHiggins has been working with Robbie since 2015, when he helped her prepare for \"The Legend of Tarzan,\" according to PopSugar. The \"Barbie\" cast worked out together while they were filming in London, which Higgins told the outlet was a \"really collaborative, fun experience.\"\n\n\"Everyone was just up for a laugh and to feel good, it wasn't aesthetics,\" he added. \"It wasn't like the superhero movies that I usually work on. 'Barbie' was more about: let's just feel good, and if you feel good, that's going to translate on camera.\"\n\nThe Kens did four days of strength work and two days of Pilates a week. Warner Bros.\n\nHiggins also told the outlet that the Barbies in the cast typically did four days of Pilates and two days of strength and conditioning work per week, while the Kens in the cast \u2014 including Gosling and Simu Liu \u2014 did four days of strength work and two days of Pilates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn strength and conditioning days, Higgins had the cast do a circuit-style workout that included exercises for shoulders, biceps, back, and lower body. He told PopSugar the circuit always finished with a move for abs, which was often a plank.\n\nPlanks help build strength and muscle throughout the body, and Robbie isn't the only celebrity with an impressive record. Cher once revealed that she's held a plank for five minutes.\n\nWhen it comes to staying fit, Higgins told PopSugar that it's good to mix things up and try new workouts.\n\n\"Why don't you learn how to do it all?\" he said. \"And you can, because the body responds significantly well to diversity.\""

    "text": "OK, since everyone else seems to be writing about her, it\u2019s time for me to jump on the Barbie bandwagon.\n\nFirst, I have to tell you I still have my childhood Barbie and Ken that came to me as hand-me-downs from my older sister, Susan.\n\nApparently, Susan had the first ever Barbie\u2026the long haired blonde who came dressed in a black and white knitted one-piece swimsuit.\n\nUnfortunately, all that\u2019s left of the original is the bottom half of the suit\u2026why someone cut off the top half, we will never know. Maybe it was our sister, Laura (born six years after Susan and six years before me), who preferred catching tadpoles over playing with Barbies.\n\nThe Barbie I inherited is a strawberry blond with bubble-cut hair from the early 60s. She\u2019s much less valuable than the original, which is going for upwards of $25,000 these days. I\u2019ve only recently come to appreciate the distinction. The new movie has prompted me to do some research.\n\nTo Susan and me, Barbie was a clothes horse. Before I was born, Susan would save her pennies and head to the Dupree drugstore on Slappey Drive in our hometown of Albany, GA to carefully select outfits and accessories.\n\nI loved dressing Barbie in those beautiful clothes that Susan purchased years before I was born, but, in the 70s, I lost interest in the newer clothes that were not as elegant or well made.\n\nLittle did I know that over the past 60-plus years, Barbie has come to represent much more than fashion. Barbie has had more than 250 groundbreaking careers for women, including astronaut, pilot, firefighter and surgeon. She\u2019s also been a candidate in nearly every presidential election since 1992.\n\nBarbie now comes in a variety of body shapes, skin colors, ethnicity and abilities. Just this year, the first Barbie with Down syndrome was released.\n\nIn my opinion, the movie does a great job of displaying the range of Barbies, but one thing that is missing, for the most part, is the importance of pets to the iconic doll.\n\nSpoiler alert\u2026two pets that make an appearance in the movie are dogs that caused controversy in their time and were discontinued. Tanner disgustingly ate and pooped the same plastic poop repeatedly. Sugar was part of the Palm Beach Sugar Daddy Ken set. When folks took offense to the doll\u2019s name, Mattel tried to justify that Ken was \u201cSugar\u2019s daddy.\u201d\n\nAccording to Barbie lore, she has had more than 40 pets, including 21 dogs, six cats, 14 horses, three ponies and a parrot. (We won\u2019t count the lion cub, giraffe, zebra, panda and chimpanzee as pets.)\n\nA chimp accompanies the Dr. Jane Goodall Barbie, released last year to honor Goodall\u2019s groundbreaking research with chimpanzees and her nature conservation efforts. Made of recycled plastic, Goodall is just one of the Inspiring Women Barbie series that pays tribute to real-life heroines.\n\nFor those who thought Barbie was a just a body shaming bimbo, it\u2019s good to know that, according to Mattel, the doll\u2019s purpose has been to inspire the limitless potential in every girl.\n\nOf special note to me, there are at least three different Barbie veterinarian dolls, which I hope will inspire more girls to pursue this career and help fill a critical national shortage of vets.\n\nI also hope that if the movie has a sequel, pets play a more prominent role next time. After all, it\u2019s estimated that more than two-thirds of American households have pets. Barbieland needs better representation than Tanner and Sugar.\n\nIf you would like to add a pet to your home, please adopt during our \u201cBig Dog Summer\u201d promotion, now through Aug. 9.\n\nTo view adoptable animals, pasadenahumane.org/adopt\n\nDia DuVernet is president and CEO of Pasadena Humane. pasadenahumane.org"

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n\nAs Barbie finally hits theaters this weekend, star Margot Robbie is in the spotlight for her performance as the titular doll. But who is her real-life Ken?\n\nRobbie, who is very private, quietly tied the knot to producer Tom Ackerley in 2016, after they dated for three years. Now, the two run a production company together\u2014and the latest film they produced is none other than Barbie.\n\n\"I'm always nervous to start any job. I have this complete crisis of faith and think, 'Oh my gosh, I'm not even good at acting and I can't do this,'\" Robbie told the Daily Mirror about Ackerley in 2021. \"Every time I do a movie, I turn to my husband and I'm like, 'I don't think I can do this'. He says something like, 'You do this every time. You'll be fine.' \"\n\n\n\nHere's everything you need to know about Margot Robbie's husband Tom Ackerley:\n\nHe's a British film producer.\n\nRobbie and Ackerley at an Oscars afterparty in March 2018. Jon Kopaloff // Getty Images\n\nAckerley, who was raised in Guildford, Surrey and attended Godalming College, works as a producer. \"I seem to love a lot of British things,\" Robbie joked to The Mirror in 2021. \"I love Harry Potter, I love my husband and I love Love Island. It\u2019s great.\"\n\nIn addition to Barbie, he has produced Promising Young Woman, Maid, and I, Tonya, among other projects.\n\nRobbie and Ackerley met in 2013.\n\nThe couple pose for a photo in November 2022. Phillip Faraone // Getty Images\n\nThey met on the set of Suite Fran\u00e7aise; she was an actress in the film and he was an assistant director. They started dating a year later. \"I was the ultimate single gal. The idea of relationships made me want to vomit,\" Robbie later said. \"And then this crept up on me. We were friends for so long. I was always in love with him, but I thought, Oh, he would never love me back. Don't make it weird, Margot. Don't be stupid and tell him that you like him. And then it happened, and I was like, Of course we're together. This makes so much sense, the way nothing has ever made sense before.\"\n\nThe same year they started dating, they created production company LuckyChap Entertainment alongside friends Josey McNamara and Sophia Kerr. \"I\u2019m a great advocate of doing business with your partner,\" Robbie Porter in 2018. \"Being married is actually the most fun ever, life got way more fun somehow. I have a responsibility being someone\u2019s wife, I want to be better.\"\n\nThey got engaged and married in secret.\n\nMargot Robbie and Tom Ackerley attend the world premiere of Barbie together. Axelle/Bauer-Griffin // Getty Images\n\nThe private couple tied the knot in December 2016 in Australia. After, instead of going on a honeymoon, they went to work on I, Tonya\u2014and took their delayed honeymoon to Tahiti after shooting wrapped. \"We did [I, Tonya] instead of our honeymoon. There were times we were sitting in a car parked in Atlanta freezing cold being like, 'We should be on a beach right now. We should be on a honeymoon. What are we doing?!' Following our dream,\" Robbie told Extra in 2017.\n\nHe was an extra in third Harry Potter movies.\n\n\"My husband is in the Harry Potter movies. I know, I was like, 'Had you told me sooner we would've been married very quickly,'\" Robbie, a major Potter fan, said in 2020. \"But he was an extra when he was a little kid \u2014 he was one of the Slytherin extras when Draco pushes some kids out of the way to see Buckbeak in the third book. He pushes my husband out of the way.\"\n\nHe's on Instagram, but rarely posts.\n\nRobbie has no social media accounts, but Ackerley has an Instagram, @alpha_meows. Robbie sometimes appears, like in this slideshow of photos from their trip to Lapland (swipe through):\n\nAs of this writing, however, he hasn't posted since March 2021."

YouTube/Bryce Vine\n\nThe music video stars Vine as somewhat of a Dr. Frankenstein, who creates a doll-like version of his dream woman \u2014 a.k.a. Shay, 38, who comes to life and eventually turns evil. The reality star has been friends with Vine for a decade and wanted to work with the \"La La Land\" performer for years.\n\n\"It's funny 'cause I've never seen one episode of Vanderpump Rules, and I don't really want to 'cause I know the kind of person she is off-screen,\" Vine tells PEOPLE. \"She\u2019s been a supporter of my music forever and earlier in the day before the director called her, Scheana texted her husband [Brock Davies] saying she wished she was the lead of my 'Drew Barrymore' video. When the phone rang offering the role, she dropped everything to make it happen.\"\n\nThe new single marks Vine's second song inspired by an A-list movie star following 2018's \"Drew Barrymore,\" his breakout hit, which he references in the new song's lyrics: \"I'm over that Drew Barry / Need a spice girl.\" (Hopefully Barrymore isn't jealous, as she told him on The Kelly Clarkson Show in 2019, \"I'm such a big fan of yours, and I am so lucky to be the name of one of your songs.\")\n\nBryce Vine in December 2021. Michael Tullberg/Getty\n\n\"Sometimes the hardest part of writing songs in the studio is figuring out what the hell you even wanna write about,\" the musician tells PEOPLE, explaining that he invited his girlfriend, model Ellis Mae, to the studio for \"some good feminine energy\" on the day \"Margot Robbie\" was written.\n\n\"She arrived in a fully pink getup with her blonde hair perfectly wavy and a bubbly disposition that screams California in the best way,\" says Vine. \"We decided then to write the song completely around her and how a girl like her would want to be sung about.\"\n\nWhile he hasn't spoken to Robbie, 33, just yet, he does have a message for her if she happens to watch the music video. \"Even though we can\u2019t be together,\" says Vine, \"just know that you\u2019re iconic, and you set a new bar for what I look for in a woman.\"\n\n"

    "text": "Life in plastic may be fantastic but the tedious ideology-driven comedy \u201cBarbie\u201d (Warner Bros.) is not. Although genuinely objectionable elements are relatively few, moreover, this is distinctly not a movie for the age group to which the figurine of the title is primarily marketed.\n\nMargot Robbie plays the famous Mattel doll that first arrived on store shelves back in 1959. Together with her sidekick Ken (Ryan Gosling), Barbie inhabits a pink-hued feminist paradise where the president, the nine justices of the Supreme Court and all Nobel Prize winners are women.\n\nTroubled and bewildered by hitherto alien thoughts of death as well as by a sudden physical imperfection \u2014 a patch of cellulite on her leg \u2014 our heroine consults one of her many alter egos, Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon). The problem, it seems, is that whoever is currently playing with Standard Barbie is sad and her sorrow is affecting her toy.\n\nBarbie and Ken journey to the real world\n\nSo it\u2019s time to journey to the real world to meet the cause of the difficulty and, presumably, cheer her up sufficiently to restore the status quo. Ken stows away in the back seat of Barbie\u2019s car and thus gets to share in the adventure.\n\nArriving in Los Angeles, Barbie discovers the tribulations \u2014 and Ken the joys \u2014 of patriarchy. Barbie also learns to her surprise that, far from being revered as a symbol of female empowerment, she\u2019s reviled as the embodiment of women\u2019s subjugation.\n\nKen manages to return to Barbie Land first and proceeds to imbue it with male dominance. Thus, by the time Barbie gets back to her natural setting, it\u2019s not only been tainted by warped values but turned topsy-turvy.\n\nBarbie will need the cooperation of all her many eponymous iterations to avert cultural and political disaster. Fortunately, she\u2019ll also have the help of Gloria (America Ferrera) and Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt), a mother-and-daughter duo from the realm of human beings.\n\nMovie not acceptable for little kids\n\nAs scripted by director Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, the picture bemoans the plight of women while blithely stereotyping men as selfish, childish and aggressive. With the rivalry of the sexes raging, little of the humor (Will Ferrell plays the dizzy CEO of Mattel) and less of the sentiment (Rhea Perlman plays the wise granny who co-founded the company) works.\n\nDespite all the controversy that continues to swirl around her, Barbie has undeniably proved a long-lasting source of enjoyment for youngsters. Her namesake movie, by contrast, is too closely focused on its own agenda to provide older viewers with much entertainment and too freewheeling to be acceptable for little kids.\n\nThe film contains stylized physical violence, a few instances each of mild swearing and crass talk, mature wordplay and brief sexual and anatomical humor. The OSV News classification is A-II \u2013 adults and adolescents. The Motion Picture Association rating is PG-13 \u2013 parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nJohn Mulderig is media reviewer for OSV News. Follow him on Twitter @JohnMulderig1."

    "text": "The thing I keep hearing from people in Hollywood is \u201cI don\u2019t know how she got away with it.\u201d When a theatrically released movie is made at this budget level, anything idiosyncratic or challenging often gets whittled down by studio notes. How were you able to preserve your sensibility the whole way through this process?\n\nI was originally meant to just write it with Noah, and then we finished the script and that was the thing that made me want to direct it. It felt so clear to me: If they didn\u2019t want to make that [version], I didn\u2019t need to make it. Margot, as the producer and star, was really the first person to line up and say, \u201cI want to do it her way.\u201d And then as we started adding collaborators and gathering more cast, suddenly there was a large number of people who were excited to do something that was this, excuse the pun, out of the box.\n\nPart of me thinks that because it was all so idiosyncratic and so wild, it was almost like no one really knew where to start taking it apart. Like, where are you going to start hacking away at how strange it was? Maybe because there was this sense of sheer joy behind it, it was this hard thing to say, \u201cOh no, we don\u2019t want that thing that\u2019s sheer joy.\u201d People wanted it to exist, in all its weirdness.\n\nEven the movie\u2019s inciting incident is pretty heady. I\u2019m trying to imagine how the executives reacted when you told them, \u201cWell, things really kick off when Barbie starts having irrepressible thoughts of death.\u201d\n\nI know! We had the idea of the movie starting off like this whirligig, and that line becomes something where she almost breaks the movie. And what do you do after you\u2019ve broken the movie? Her character tries to just keep the movie going normally again, but there\u2019s no way to do it. But yeah, I don\u2019t know that anyone totally knew what the tone of this was going to be until it was all done. I mean, within the group of people who were deeply making it, we knew, but it was truly an act of faith for everyone else."

    "text": "Name: Ariana Greenblatt\n\nAge: 15\n\nBorn and Raised: Born in New York, she spent a stint in Florida before moving to Los Angeles when acting started to pick up, when she was around 7 years old.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of like a very natural accident. I was a dancer at first in Florida, but every time I had a dance I would treat it like the biggest performance of my life. So I\u2019ve always kind of had that bug in me, to perform,\u201d she says. \u201cI came to L.A. for a family vacation and my dad knows a lot of people here, so we were just saying \u2018hi\u2019 to his old friends and then I was sent out by my manager at the time for a bunch of meetings and I didn\u2019t know what they were. I just thought I was meeting people, but they were actually auditions for three different roles and I got all three of them in the same week. And that kind of snowballed.\u201d\n\nBig Break: Greenblatt stars in the summer\u2019s most anticipated film \u201cBarbie,\u201d as one of the humans (America Ferrera is her mom in the film). The audition came to her without revealing what the project actually was.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know much about what it would actually be, but I just knew Greta [Gerwig] was involved with it, and that\u2019s the only thing I needed to hear to put my life into the audition,\u201d she says. \u201cI did the first round of normal auditions and then once I realized Margot [Robbie] was Barbie and I started connecting the dots and the announcements were coming out, I\u2019m like, \u2018oh my God, this is insanity.\u2019 I fully was just trying to keep my cool and get to know my character really well.\u201d\n\nAriana Greenblatt at the premiere of \u201cBarbie\u201d in Los Angeles. Christopher Polk for WWD\n\nGrowing Up Barbie: \u201cI grew up with the Barbie Dreamhouse. But it\u2019s weird because I didn\u2019t have a lot of Barbies: I had a lot of Monster High dolls, so I put my Monster High dolls inside the Dreamhouse and acted like it was their house,\u201d Greenblatt says. \u201cBut I always loved watching the Barbie Dreamhouse show.\u201d\n\nBarbie Bonding: \u201cI got really close with Alexandra Shipp, who was one of the Barbies. I would always go into her trailer while filming and she would give me little tarot card readings. We would eat snacks together and talk about life,\u201d Greenblatt says. \u201cSame with America, who plays my mom. And Margot too, towards the end of filming; she became like an older sister and I would tell her about my boy problems and my school problems and she was just always there to listen and we would gossip about my life and it was great. She was like my little outlet.\u201d\n\nCareer Goals: \u201cI think Natalie Portman has had such a great career. She\u2019s been doing it since she was really young as well, and I think she\u2019s navigated it in a beautiful way. And she went to school and she\u2019s really smart and well spoken. So I really like her career. Also Saoirse Ronan, I think she has an incredible career, and she\u2019s also so young still. I think women like that, who have paved the way for themselves and also managed to either prioritize school or prioritize other things too, which is really cool.\u201d\n\nUp Next: \u201cObviously with this writer\u2019s strike, everything is kind of crazy, but I definitely have a few things still that will be coming out \u2014 some I cannot talk about at all. Yeah. But one that has already been announced is \u2018Borderlands\u2019 that should be coming out towards the end of the year. But yeah, you\u2019ll see me more. You\u2019ll get tired of me.\u201d\n\nInterview was conducted before the SAG-AFTRA strike."

The \u201cLove Island\u201d star has one line in the film in which he plays a Ken in Barbieland.\n\nMorgan highlighted that Taylor\u2019s trajectory from reality TV to starring in a blockbuster movie is \u201cnot a normal progression for \u2018Love Island.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fairly overwhelming,\u201d replied Taylor.\n\nAccording to Morgan, the story about how Taylor got the part is \u201cequally mind-blowing.\u201d\n\nSome of Taylor\u2019s friends had been at a movie premier that Robbie was attending and they were invited to an afterparty that she was throwing. Taylor joined them at the afterparty where he was introduced to Robbie.\n\nRobbie is known to be a huge \u201cLove Island\u201d fan, publicly voicing her support for the show in multiple interviews.

I\u2019d say an inch,\u201d said Taylor.\n\n\u201cThen you have a mate with very large testicles, is that right?\u201d asked Morgan.\n\nTaylor laughed and replied, \u201cMy dad\u2019s best mate has very big bullocks and he can carry 12 bottles of beer on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd this is how you managed to get inside Margot Robbie\u2019s head to end up playing Ken,\u201d said Morgan.\n\n\u201cI will say I panicked and I just said whatever came to my head,\u201d Taylor said in justification of his bizarre conversation.\n\n\u201cIt was relevant,\u201d Taylor continued. \u201clike people were talking about penises.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is how you basically wooed Margot Robbie to get in the movie,\u201d concluded Morgan. \u201cNext thing, 18 months later, you are in Barbie.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am in Barbie,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cAll because of micro-penises and big balls.\u201d\n\nWatch the exchange around the nine-minute mark in the video above."

Her mates mostly work in the film industry too so they\u2019re not fazed by Margot\u2019s fame and she can just be herself.\u201d\n\nAll her hard work has paid off though, as Barbie has received rave reviews around the world and has grossed more than \u00a3450million.\n\nMargot and Tom, who wed in 2016, formed their own production company, Lucky Chap, with some of their mates.\n\nSpeaking about it previously, she said: \u201cWe started our production company with our best friends and it continues to be a wonderful group dynamic.\n\n\u201cWe all really work well together.

    "text": "Back during the early days of development on the Barbie movie, Amy Schumer was attached to play the titular role. As ideas for the movie kept evolving though, it transformed into something different from the initial concept, and the comedian bailed on the part. Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig ended up taking over the project, developing it into the pink, sparkly extravaganza that just hit theaters. Now, the I Feel Pretty star is reacting to the summer blockbuster in a tongue-in-cheek way that hints at her previous casting.\n\nAmy Schumer posted a goofy photo on her Instagram that shows her sporting a big sun hat. In her caption, she talked about seeing both Oppenheimer and Barbie this weekend, meaning she participated in the viral \"Barbenheimer\" double feature craze. Instead of suggesting she should have played the title character in the fantasy film, as originally intended, she joked that she actually should\u2019ve been considered for another major role. You can see her hysterical post below:\n\nA post shared by @amyschumer A photo posted by on\n\nThis is an absolutely hilarious way of addressing her connection to Margot Robbie's movie. Instead of brushing aside Robbie, the Trainwreck star focuses on Oppenheimer, musing that she could've played Emily Blunt's Katherine \"Kitty\" Oppenheimer. That's obviously much funnier, considering she has zero connection to that movie. I\u2019m honestly not sure she would've been right for the role of Blunt\u2019s Kitty, as she suggests, but I love the shoutout for one of the most exciting movies of the summer.\n\nWhen Amy Schumer was attached to Barbie, the film was very different and in her words, not as \u201cfeminist and cool.\u201d She left the project in 2017, and Robbie was cast in the titular role when Warner Brothers took over the project. With Robbie and Greta Gerwig as the feminine creative minds behind the project, it seemingly received a fresh creative jolt. Schumer was previously asked if she was looking forward to the new iteration of the film that hit theaters. At the time, the actress was enthusiastic, about the project, so it seems evident that there's not kind of bad blood in the mix here.\n\nThe Last Comic Standing alum continues to show she's one of the wittiest comedic minds in the entertainment industry. She always seems able to put a funny spin on a potentially awkward situation, and she did so with such class using this post. It\u2019s hilarious and subtle while encouraging others to see the two wonderful films that just so happen to be in theaters at the same time. Also, she's totally rocking that sun hat, so maybe Christopher Nolan should keep the comedy star in mind he needs to cast another protagonist that sports a sweet lid.\n\nYou can catch both Barbie and Oppenheimer in theaters now just like Amy Schumer did. Fans of the Snatched actress should check out her latest project, Life & Beth, which is streaming now with a Hulu subscription. And for more insight on other films hitting cinemas and streaming this year, make sure to consult our 2023 movie release schedule."

As of this writing the blockbuster film\u2019s star, Margot Robbie, has ascended into the top five for Best Actress, according to the Expert journalists we\u2019ve surveyed from major media outlets. If they\u2019re right this will be her third career nomination.\n\nOn July 24, at which point \u201cBarbie\u201d was already a box office phenom, Experts ranked Robbie ninth in the Best Actress race. By July 26 she had risen to seventh place. On July 30 she moved up to sixth place. And finally on August 1 she slipped past Natalie Portman (\u201cMay December\u201d) to take over fifth position. She still trails front-runner Fantasia Barrino (\u201cThe Color Purple\u201d) as well as likely nominees Greta Lee (\u201cPast Lives\u201d), Sandra Huller (\u201cAnatomy of a Fall\u201c), and Annette Bening (\u201cNyad\u201d).\n\nIt would be unusual for an actor to be nominated for a character based on a doll, but Robbie has thoroughly proved her mettle with a previous Best Actress nom for \u201cI, Tonya\u201d (a film she also produced) and a Best Supporting Actress bid for \u201cBombshell.\u201d And her performance in \u201cBarbie\u201d has been described by critics as \u201cpitch-perfect\u201d and \u201cirresistible.\u201d She \u201cnimbly handles the comedic rhythm of these worlds.\u201d And as with \u201cI, Tonya,\u201d Robbie is also a producer here, which might win her extra points from academy members impressed by her creative achievements in front of and behind the camera.\n\nOf course, it bears repeating that this awards season still has a long, long way to go, and we can\u2019t be entirely sure that the current WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes won\u2019t stretch that season even longer. As it stands, we have yet to see other Best Actress hopefuls like Regina King in \u201cShirley,\u201d Jessica Lange in \u201cLong Day\u2019s Journey Into Night,\u201d and the aforementioned Barrino and Bening. So will Robbie keep rising higher, or will this year\u2019s field of contenders eventually crowd her out?\n\nPREDICTthe 2024 Oscar nominations\n\nMake your predictions at Gold Derby now.

    "text": "I saw \u201cBarbie\u201d the day after it premiered. You probably do not need another \u201cBarbie\u201d take after nearly every pundit in America has already taken a whack, but I am still thinking about the movie nearly a month later. In particular, I continue to marvel at the performance of Margot Robbie, who played the titular heroine \u2014 Stereotypical Barbie \u2014 and who I think isn\u2019t getting enough credit for holding the movie together.\n\nFor the three of you who haven\u2019t seen the movie yet, here\u2019s a rough outline of the plot: Stereotypical Barbie has an existential crisis in women-run Barbie Land when her body becomes less than flawless \u2014 a spot of cellulite here, an unarched foot there. She must journey to the real world, leaving an army of other Barbies behind, to get back to a state of unquestioning bliss. She grudgingly takes Ken (a perfectly doltish Ryan Gosling) with her, and in the real world he discovers the concept of patriarchy. Ken returns to Barbie Land before her and stages a coup, overthrowing the matriarchy and installing a band of \u201cdoofi\u201d in their place. Some dance battles, terrible crooning and rousing feminist speeches ensue, and ultimately, Barbie triumphs (how could she not?), while also choosing beautifully messy reality over plastic perfection.\n\nDespite the pro-Barbie message, I had the same reaction as The Times\u2019s chief film critic, Manohla Dargis, who praised Robbie\u2019s performance as \u201ccharming and subtly phased,\u201d while acknowledging that she is upstaged by Ken\u2019s \u201ccomic obtuseness and arc.\u201d (My 7-year-old daughter still wants Ken\u2019s Mojo Dojo Casa House.) At first, when I left the theater, it irked me that Robbie and her band of Barbies \u2014 with the possible exception of exiled Weird Barbie, who doesn\u2019t fit the mold (Kate McKinnon) \u2014 didn\u2019t get to have as much fun as any of the Kens or Allan (a hilariously disgruntled Michael Cera, who plays the only male doll not named Ken). A movie called \u201cBarbie,\u201d and Barbie didn\u2019t always feel like the main character.\n\nBut after reflection, I wondered if that was an intentional commentary on what it means to be a woman \u2014 doing the necessary and unsung labor of plot exposition while the men in the film get to be Mr. Fun Dad. I also kept thinking about Robbie as Stereotypical Barbie. Her movements were always precise and embodied \u2014 it\u2019s not easy to play plastic. But crucially, it was quietly moving to watch the dawning realization of mortality, human cruelty and prejudice register on her luminous face."

She said her team originally toyed with the idea of Robbie, Ryan Gosling, and other cast members wearing makeup that made them look artificial.\n\n\"We thought, 'Should they have plastic seams? Should they have plastic skin, plastic hair?'\" she told the publication. \"We didn't like all of those things in the end because Barbies are beautiful in every child's mind. So once we created that fake image, it wasn't beautiful.\"\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nInstead, Primorac made the cast look like picture-perfect versions of their human selves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There's a high finish to everything,\" she said. \"So the hair is bigger and the skin is more luminous.\"\n\nRobbie, in particular, had countless makeup options, all of which helped her get into character.\n\n\"Margot would choose her lipstick and blush according to what costume she wore. We had a little shop set up for her with 50 shades of red and pink, and she could choose whichever one was best for that outfit,\" Primorac said, comparing the system to \"a Barbie that comes in a box with all of her accessories.\"\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nBut no matter what hairstyle the actors had or the makeup they were wearing, Primorac said she ultimately focused on ensuring that \"every single Ken and Barbie\" was \"the best version of themselves\" to make them more believable and relatable.\n\n\"Everyone had to have the best skin that suits them, everyone had to have the hair color that suits them,\" the makeup artist told E!

The couple purchased the property the year I, Tonya came to cinemas, a role which won Robbie an Oscar nomination.\n\nMargot Robbie's chic So-Cal home is characterized by its perfect garden spaces and white wood panelling \u2013 and that's just the exterior.\n\nThis 3,300 square foot property was built in 2016, and sits on 0.15 acres of land. The house's high ceilings and oak hardwood floors contribute to the splendor and openness of this property which incorporates West Coastal and New England aesthetics. The house has four bedrooms and six bathrooms.\n\n(Image credit: Engel & V\u00f6lkers Beverly Hills / Paul Barnaby)\n\nThe property includes a number of stand out features, including French doors, ocean views from the primary suite's balcony, a wine cellar, fireplace and a Carrera marble kitchen counter. The backyard contains a pool, bar and cabana.\n\nThis property is not only architecturally stunning, but also exudes charisma with design that isn't taken too seriously, evident by the living room's indoor swing, round sofa and pet room with a separate entry door to the property, which was likely enjoyed by the puppy they adopted earlier that year.\n\n(Image credit: Engel & V\u00f6lkers Beverly Hills / Paul Barnaby)\n\nPut simply, this home is manicured perfection, with its open concept, bright, beachy vibe, it's easy to see why the actress fell in love with it. It's safe to say this property lives up in its grandeur to Barbie's Malibu Dreamhouse.\n\nThe house listed in June 2021 for $3.4 million.\n\n(Image credit: Engel & V\u00f6lkers Beverly Hills / Paul Barnaby)\n\nMargot Robbie's former Bungalow \u2013 purchased in 2018\n\nThe same year Margot Robbie starred as Mary Queen of Scots, she purchased a bungalow in Hollywood Heights to renovate. She is said to have bought the two bed, one bathroom property from Dustin Lance, the writer of Milk, for $950,000.\n\nThe bungalow, built in 1951, is 945 square foot, making it a manageable project for the star to renovate between and during filming. This included refinishing the hardwood floors, renovating the kitchen and painting throughout. The exterior of the house is painted white with blue accent shutters, banister and doors. The house also has blue window covers, and plant beds on various levels, and in the back of the property there is a tiered yard.\n\nThe primary bedroom is close to nature, with French doors leading onto a small courtyard. The living room also has French doors, creating a light and airy flow throughout the property. The highest level of the terrace captures plenty of natural light and is surrounded by plants, creating a peaceful spot for drinks and sunbathing. This spot also has views of the canyon behind the property.\n\nMargot is said to have sold the house in 2021 for $1.2 million, after renting it out for three years.\n\nMargot Robbie's current Venice beach house \u2013 purchased in 2019\n\nIn 2019, Robbie invested in an edgy Venice Beach compound (see above) which she bought for $5 million in an off-market deal. This Los Angeles property is made up of three separate concrete structures on a double-wide lot, including a loft space which includes a kitchen and office space, a second separate structure, which is a two-bed bungalow and, thirdly, a cottage.\n\nAlthough from the outside the concrete property appears uninviting, with only two windows above the three-car garage, the inside of the property is quite the opposite, and ensures utter privacy. With plenty of natural light, white walls, high exposed wood ceilings and light wooden flooring, it captures the Venice Beach lifestyle.\n\nThe property is strikingly modern, repeating the concrete and silver metal theme throughout and in the yard, and which is harmoniously balanced by the wooden furniture and doors that enhance the natural elements of the home.\n\nWith the stunning modern interiors of the house, fans were delighted when Margot Robbie gave viewers a peek into the property during a Vogue 73 Questions video series.\n\nThis revealed some stand-out features, such as a barn door and an outdoor decking area with a long dining table, surrounded by plants and enclosed by other parts of the property.\n\nMargot Robbie grew up on a farm on Australia's Gold Coast which appears to be where some of her interior style has rooted from.\n\nThe house features a lap pool which Margot told Vogue she loves to start her day swimming in. The separate living spaces mean outdoor space is integrated into the home, ensuring plenty of natural light is introduced into the living spaces, which is furthered by the large windows and French doors.\n\nIn 2021, it was reported by TMZ that Margot had donned her renovator hat again, putting the house under major construction work. When completed, this will reportedly up the property's worth to over $15 million.\n\nKnowing Margot and Tom's love for beachy interiors, possibly influenced by her Australian roots, we're excited to see how this property turns out."

    "text": "There\u2019s a moment in \u201cBarbie\u201d where Ryan Gosling, who plays the wickedly funny and insecure manchild, Ken, steps off the screen and yells, \u201cSublime!\u201d It might be the most extraordinary Oscar-worthy clip of a person not to be seen on screen.\n\n\u201cBarbie,\u201d the new meta-comedy from Warner Bros, which also acts as an infomercial for Mattel, finally lands for audiences and could be one of the leading comedy films seeking Oscar recognition by year\u2019s end if Academy members can take it seriously. Gosling\u2019s iconic turn, at least, is worthy of best supporting actor recognition.\n\nCommercial comedies, particularly those without the added \u201cdramedy\u201d sub-qualifier, have faced difficulty landing Academy recognition for decades (i.e., Vince Vaughn in \u201cWedding Crashers\u201d). However, a promising trend has been seen in the last few years with acting nominees like Robert Downey Jr in \u201cTropic Thunder\u201d (2008), Melissa McCarthy in \u201cBridesmaids\u201d (2011) and Maria Bakalova in \u201cBorat Subsequent Moviefilm\u201d (2020) landing comfortably in their respective fields. Gosling could join the ranks.\n\nGosling, 42, is a respected actor in the industry with two nominations under his belt \u2014 one as the drug-addicted teacher in \u201cHalf Nelson\u201d (2006) and the other as the passionate jazz player in \u201cLa La Land\u201d (2016). He may not be the first name you think of when discussing brilliant comedic actors, but he\u2019s displayed his funny chops in films such as Shane Black\u2019s \u201cThe Nice Guys\u201d (2016) opposite Russell Crowe. With abs and a fur coat, Gosling is the film\u2019s MVP.\n\nWhen it comes to the film\u2019s overall chances, it will all rest on sustainability through the season. While the reviews are strong (sitting at 89% on Rotten Tomatoes), it\u2019ll need to show strength through significant guild recognition through the season, such as WGA and PGA, to have any chance of being one of the few populist movies that land in the best picture lineup.\n\nEverett Collection\n\nAs the titular character, Margot Robbie is undoubtedly tailor-made for the role she was born to play. With a career that has already landed the Australian performer two Oscar noms herself \u2014 \u201cI, Tonya\u201d (2017) and \u201cBombshell\u201d (2019) \u2014 she\u2019ll be a fan favorite throughout the remaining calendar year. However, outside of being a solid contender for a Golden Globe in lead comedy actress, an Oscar slot in best actress might be challenging to attain (she\u2019s also a listed producer, which could help in the best picture). The same goes for America Ferrera, who is wonderful as Gloria, delivering an inspirational speech about women\u2019s roles worldwide that will be used in acting classroom monologues for years. Ferrera also has Sony\u2019s \u201cDumb Money,\u201d which could put her on Oscar\u2019s radar.\n\nGerwig\u2019s skillful commentary on feminism and biting humor could create an opportunity for her to land recognition in adapted screenplay. With three previous noms for \u201cLady Bird\u201d (2017) in directing and original screenplay and \u201cLittle Women\u201d (2019) in adapted, she\u2019s a well-regarded scribe and could land, along with her real-life partner Noah Baumbach, in the race.\n\nWhat\u2019s most needed in the \u201cBarbie\u201d best picture quest is the recognition of its artisans. Production design (Sarah Greenwood, Katie Spencer) and costumes (Jacqueline Durran) seem like no-brainers no matter the outcome of the rest of the year. But can it add editing by Nick Huoy, an original score mention by Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt, or an original song for Billie Eilish and Finneas (\u201cWhat Was I Made For\u201d)? Those answers will be vital to its chances.\n\nThe \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d frenzy has linked the two titles in audiences\u2019 minds. Interestingly, with \u201cOppenheimer\u201d feeling assured of a run for best picture run, that could weirdly help \u201cBarbie\u201d get on those same ballots (as long as the campaigns remain as friendly as they\u2019ve been the past few weeks).\n\nCheck out the latest Oscar predictions on Variety Awards Circuit."

When you go to see this amazing film please don\u2019t blink.\u201d\n\nWhile some still questioned whether he was joking, Brydon does make a cameo appearance during a scene at the house of \u201cweird\u201d Barbie, played by Kate McKinnon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobbie, who plays the lead role and serves as a producer, said she wanted to give Brydon a role because she\u2019s a \u201chuge fan\u201d of BBC series Gavin & Stacey.\n\nHad a great time at the Barbie premiere celebrating my pivotal role as Sugar Daddy Ken. When you go to see this amazing film please don't blink \ud83d\ude0a pic.twitter.com/osFeuRbf3L \u2014 Rob Brydon (@RobBrydon) July 13, 2023\n\nSpeaking to Cosmopolitan UK, Robbie said: \u201cI\u2019m a huge fan of Gavin & Stacey so Rob Brydon being in it was an enormous priority for me.\u201d\n\nAt the film\u2019s premiere, Brydon told Virgin Radio UK why he believes he landed a role in the Hollywood film. \u201cI had a message a few years ago that Margot Robbie was a big fan of Uncle Bryn and would I record a message for her birthday,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo I recorded a video for her. I think maybe this part is her way of saying thank you.\n\n\u201cI said \u2018Hello Margot. I\u2019ve loved you in all your films and I\u2019ll tell you for why\u2026\u2019 So when I met her on the set, she said, \u2018Ah, thank you so much for that message\u2026\u2019 So that was quite nice.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrydon played Uncle Bryn in Gavin & Stacey across the show\u2019s three seasons and its two Christmas specials in 2008 and 2019.\n\nAlongside Robbie, Barbie stars Ryan Gosling, America Ferrera, Michael Cera, Ariana Greenblatt, Simu Liu, Issa Rae, Rhea Perlman, Helen Mirren and Will Ferrell.\n\nIn a four-star review, NME wrote: \u201cWhat follows is a nuanced, rose-tinted comedy adventure, set to a stonking pop soundtrack featuring Lizzo and Billie Eilish, that somehow lives up to the immense hype. To borrow a pun from Ken\u2019s coolest jacket (out of a long lineup), Barbie is more than \u2018kenough\u2019.\u201d"

    "text": "As the world progresses towards a more inclusive future, several successful individuals have proved that physical disabilities cannot hinder their dreams and aspirations. Coming out in support of those with hearing impairments, celebrities who know sign language have used the skill on many occasions to spread some love.\n\nFrom acting to literature, music, television, sports and more, famous deaf people have become icons not just due to their success but because they continue to inspire people with their journey. History bears witness to numerous such heroes \u2014 Helen Keller, one of the most prominent names in relation to American Sign Language (ASL), was the first deaf-blind person to graduate from college in 1904 and authored several books. William \u201cDummy\u201d Hoy was a prominent deaf Major League Baseball player, credited with inventing hand signals, which players use even today.\n\nWhile stories of well-known deaf celebrities are inspiring, hearing stars who have learned sign language to connect with admirers also deserve special mention.\n\nToday, 41 countries recognise multiple sign languages, many of which cater to various language diction and dialects. For instance, despite both the UK and the USA being English-speaking countries, British sign language (BSL) is very different from ASL.\n\nFamous personalities who can communicate in sign language\n\nMargot Robbie\n\nBarbie (2023) star Margot Robbie has time and again wowed her audiences with her diverse set of roles. From starring as Harley Quinn in The Suicide Squad (2021) to playing Tonya Harding in I, Tonya (2017), Robbie has proved her brilliant acting prowess.\n\nIn 2023, she won over her fans with another hidden talent of hers. A video clip from the premiere of Amsterdam (2022) went viral on X, formerly known as Twitter, where the actress showed her sign language skills. While signing autographs for fans, she noticed a person gesturing. The actress immediately handed her stuff to her handlers and went over to converse with the deaf fan. The video captures Robbie saying \u201cI know it\u201d and gesturing what appears to be \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d Hawk-eyed viewers also noticed that it wasn\u2019t American Sign Language.\n\nThough not entirely fluent, the Academy Award-nominated star showed she knew the sign alphabet and later posed for a photograph with the fan. This comes as quite a surprise as Robbie has never spoken about knowing sign language before.\n\nV of BTS\n\nKim Taehyung, better known as V from the globally renowned Korean-pop group BTS, has won over the internet several times for supporting the deaf community. During his speech at the \u201cClass of 2020\u201d initiative by YouTube, for those who graduated amid the pandemic, V congratulated the batch and used American Sign Language to gesture applause. This was a big win for those with hearing loss.\n\nTaehyung using the \u2018clapping\u2019 in sign language at every chance he gets, is the sweetest thing ever- \ud83e\udd7a\n\npic.twitter.com/05RyGHXqTU \u2014 koshy\u2077 \ud83c\udf53 (@taeskoshy) May 24, 2021\n\nIn another instance, V gestured \u201cButter\u201d in an image the band put up on Weverse while promoting their 2021 album and the hit song. In 2020, he signed \u201ctogether\u201d as a mark of solidarity among ARMY, during the BangBangCon The Live online concert.\n\nTaehyung used the sign language for \u201cTogether\u201d during the Eye contact part in today\u2019s concert. His ways of showing love for Armys is always so unique. He is the most thoughtful human in this world. \ud83d\udc9c#BANGBANGCON_TheLive @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/uy2wEAchKO \u2014 KTH FACTS (@KTH_Facts) June 14, 2020\n\nHe also took to sign language to gesture \u201cI love you\u201d in one of his birthday lives to show gratitude and love for deaf people who have supported him and BTS.\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAn advocate for the LGBTQ+ community, a fashion icon, a three-time Grammy winner and a former One Direction member, Harry Styles needs no introduction when it comes to creating heart-touching music and outstanding live concerts.\n\nWhile fans may know about his acting talents, many may not be aware that the \u201cWatermelon Sugar\u201d crooner also knows to use American Sign Language adeptly. At the 2023 Grammy Awards, Styles won the Album of The Year and Best Pop Vocal Album for Harry\u2019s House. While addressing the press backstage, he was joined by an ASL interpreter. At the end of the conversation, Styles gestured \u201cthank you\u201d to her and earned enormous praise for knowing the sign language.\n\nHarry Styles thanked the interpreter in sign language \u263a\ufe0fpic.twitter.com/OlmZeuXxGy \u2014 HS (@thehrrycore) February 7, 2023\n\nIt came as a surprise for fans who didn\u2019t know about this talent. However, a 2020 Marie Claire report states the \u201cAs It Was\u201d hitmaker had shared with BBC Radio 1Xtra that he was making the most of the quarantine period. He said he was \u201clearning Italian and doing some sign language classes\u201d.\n\nJeon So-min\n\nPopular Korean actress Jeon So-min is among those celebrities who know sign language to make their fans with hearing loss feel included and loved.\n\nIn one instance, at a fan event in Anyang in 2019, a deaf fan approached her to gift a portrait drawn by him. When she learnt the person was hard of hearing, she immediately expressed her gratitude by gesturing \u201cthank you\u201d and \u201cI love you\u201d using sign language. The video won over the internet as fans poured their love for the heartfelt gesture.\n\nAmitabh Bachchan\n\nNext on the list of celebrities who know sign language is from the Indian film fraternity, Amitabh Bachchan, also known as Big B. In 2005, he starred in Sanjay Leela Bhansali\u2019s Black along with Rani Mukerji. The film narrates the cathartic journey of Michelle McNally (Mukerji) who is a mute, blind and deaf person. Debraj Sahai (Bachchan) arrives as her teacher and a beacon of light in her dark life.\n\nAs part of their preparation for the challenging roles, both Bachchan and Mukerji spent months learning sign language from the Helen Keller Institute for Deaf & Deafblind, said a News18 report. He also took Braille lessons and watched numerous documentaries. The film earned him a National Award and Filmfare Award, among other accolades.\n\nIn 2022, Bachchan sent a strong message on Indian Independence Day when he performed the national anthem with disabled children using sign language.\n\nRiz Ahmed\n\nActor Riz Ahmed is another celebrity who learned American Sign Language for a role. In Sound of Metal (2019), he appeared as Ruben Stone, a metallic drummer who sufferers rapid hearing loss while on tour. Succumbed to his fate, Ruben joins a deaf community to cope with his silent life.\n\nAhmed took sign language lessons from ASL coach Jeremy Lee Stone to get a deeper understanding of its workings and how the community feels at large. The actor found the entire experience to be quite enriching and felt the story was something that needed to be told.\n\nReflecting on learning ASL he told Variety, \u201cJeremy told me that communicating in ASL is different than communicating in English because it was more emotional. You\u2019re listening with your whole body and you\u2019re communicating with your whole body.\u201d\n\nAlexander Skarsg\u00e5rd\n\nAlexander Skarsg\u00e5rd came out in support of his Godzilla vs. Kong (2021) co-star Kaylee Hottle, who portrayed a deaf character, during the filming process. When Skarsg\u00e5rd realised he was sharing the screen with her and needed to communicate, the actor learnt ASL to make her feel more comfortable.\n\nAccording to People, the deaf actress was raised in an all-deaf family and was only nine years old when she bagged the role. Complimenting her role and ease on the set, Skarsg\u00e5rd told Junkee, \u201cIt\u2019s her first movie. It\u2019s fascinating how comfortable she is in front of the camera and how quickly she takes notes from the director Adam [Wingard].\u201d\n\n(Hero image: Courtesy V/ @thv/ Instagram;Amitabh Bachchan/ Instagram; Feature image: Courtesy V/ @thv/ Instagram)"

    "text": "Considering she's been a runway and fashion magazine cover regular for over 12 years, there are few people more qualified to tell you what to wear and how to wear it than model and actor Cara Delevingne.\n\nHowever, that's not the stance she takes on the subject. The 30-year-old ELLE UK September issue cover star, who made her catwalk debut in Burberry's AW11 show, is of the opinion that everyone should be able to govern their own style.\n\nPlaying a game of 'It's A Mood' with the magazine, charting her most iconic looks over the years, she confesses that her 'number one style rule' of all time, is this: 'If you feel good in it, it doesn't matter what anyone else says. Because as long as you feel good in it, that is the point of clothing. Sc**w everyone else, they don't know about fashion, because no-one does.'\n\n'Except ELLE UK,' she quickly caveats, a wry smile on her face.\n\nDiving into her archive to look at a picture of Delevingne and Margot Robbie attending Glastonbury music festival in June 2017, she gives us the secret to her relaxed outfit - making her own denim cut-offs out of vintage blue jeans - and reveals a favourite memory from that summer:\n\n'My favourite memory from attending Glastonbury. When we were lining up to use the bathroom - usually at Glastonbury it's a really long line - and when we were lining up, while we were standing there a man in a caterpillar outfit crawled along the floor and went under the door, because they are like stalls... and then out of the stall emerged this same guy as a butterfly. Everyone was screaming and so happy.'\n\nRecalling the 2023 Met Gala in honour of late fashion designer and industry behemoth Karl Lagerfeld, Delevingne insists that the tribute was, 'Beautiful... There was a lot of crazy sprinkled in there, but it was beautiful.'\n\nAnd thinking back to whose outfit she was most impressed with on the night, she reveals that it was Lil Nas:\n\n'In real life, it was just the bejewelledness. My gosh, that's a lot of effort. I was sitting down for a long time, but that's a lot of effort. His butt always looks so good. Those tight, tight pants.'\n\nOn the flavour of androgyny and genderless dressing that she often likes to bring to the table, she thinks back to the tuxedo look she wore to the wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank in 2018:\n\n'I wanted to mix the feminine and masculine element. I felt dashing, super cool. I wanted a walking stick... a cane. But that would have been too much, too Fred Astaire.\n\nAnd thinking more broadly about weddings in general, the Carnival Row star shared:\n\n'I love a small wedding, I love a destination wedding. They're all beautiful, They're all fun. I don't think I've ever not had a good time at a wedding.'\n\nOn being shown a picture of herself as a much younger girl, in a canary yellow, pouffy dress, she reminisces about her childhood: 'At that age, and I still do love dancing. Out on the dancefloor, throwing myself around all crazy.\n\n'I think when I was younger I had more fun [with fashion]. Now, I feel more pressure with it. I wish I didn't. I think I didn't care as much, but somehow when I cared less, I seemed to be more stylish. But now, I'm like \"this just doesn't go...\" But I wear the same thing all the time.'\n\nA lesson to leave us with for sure...\n\nWatch Cara Delevingne play 'Its A Mood' with ELLE UK in the video at the top of this article.

    "text": "Margot Robbie has revealed she had no idea that her husband Tom Ackerley starred in Harry Potter despite the Barbie star being a 'massive fan' of the films based on J.K. Rowling's iconic books\n\nMargot Robbie didn't know that her husband Tom Ackerley was in the Harry Potter movies, despite being a huge fan herself of the fantastical franchise.\n\nThe 33-year-old actor revealed the fun fact during an appearance on British TV in January 2020, before admitting that she'd have married the English film producer a lot sooner had she known about his Hogwarts history.\n\n\"When it comes to Harry Potter, I'm a massive, massive nerd,\" the Barbie star confessed on The Graham Norton Show, before being shown a photo of a 12-year-old Margot wearing spectacles and reading one of J.K. Rowling's books on her birthday. To prove just how much of a Harry Potter fan she was, she then Graham that she lied to the optician about her eyesight as a child so she could have glasses like the beloved wizard.\n\nMargot goes on to reveal that her husband Tom, whom she married in 2016, also starred in the films - albeit, only briefly.\n\n\"I was like, 'Had you told me sooner we would've been married very quickly,'\" the Oscar nominated-actress quipped, before offering more details on her hubby's Harry Potter credits. \"He was an extra when he was a little kid - he was one of the Slytherin extras when Draco pushes some kids out of the way to see Buckbeak in the third book. He pushes my husband out of the way.\"\n\nMargot first met Tom back in 2013 while filming Suite Fran\u00e7aise, in which she played Celine Joseph and he worked as a third assistant director. The pair initially became best of friends, only for romance to bloom the following year. Margot and Tom tied the knot in 2016 in a small wedding in Australia's Byron Bay, which was reportedly attended by just 50 guests. The Wolf of Wall Street star, who also previously starred on Neighbours, is believed to have worn an Oscar de la Renta dress as she was walked up the aisle by her mother, Sarie Kessler. It's understood that Margot is estranged from her father Doug, who reportedly left the family when she was very young.\n\nImage: Getty Images) Getty Images)\n\nSpeaking about her romance with Tom back in 2016 to Vogue, Margot admitted that she'd always had an aversion to longterm relationships. \"Then this crept up on me,\" she explained. \"We were friends for so long. I was always in love with him, but I thought, Oh, he would never love me back. Don't make it weird, Margot. Don't be stupid and tell him that you like him. And then it happened, and I was like, 'Of course we're together.' This makes so much sense, the way nothing has ever made sense before.\"\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads."

    "text": "Margot Robbie is known as one of the most beautiful, successful women in Hollywood, but she's really a family-oriented person who absolutely loves being married. Her life took a fascinating turn when she fell in love with Tom Ackerley, a British film producer. In a 2016 Vogue interview, she reminisced about her initial reluctance towards relationships until she realized her long-standing feelings for her then-friend, Ackerley. The two had a serendipitous meeting in 2013 during the filming of the WWII-era romance Suite Fran\u00e7aise. Their friendship transformed into a relationship, which they initially kept hidden to avoid complicating their shared living situation in London. But ever since they got together, Robbie says her life has transformed for the better.\n\nMargot Robbie Says Life Got Way Better after She Met Her Husband\n\nRobbie and Ackerley's professional and personal lives became more intertwined when they co-founded a production company, LuckyChap Entertainment, with friends Josey McNamara and Sophia Kerr. It was this venture that led them to pick up the much-anticipated Barbie movie project. Margot took a hands-on approach, bringing in Greta Gerwig to pen the script. Both Robbie and Ackerley were taken aback by the brilliance of the script, which later translated to a whopping $774.5 billion in global box office earnings.\n\nLuckyChap's success prompted Robbie and Ackerley's relocation to Los Angeles in 2016. That same year, the couple got married in Australia. Their nuptials were private and they kept most of it off social media. But they have remained happily married since. They don't have children yet, but they have a special love for traveling. After wrapping up Barbie, they traveled from London to Venice and later explored Japan. Throughout these journeys, Robbie expressed her dream of \"living on a train.\" Additionally, the actress humorously mentioned her aversion to cooking, leaving that task to the men in her life, while she and her female friends excel at enjoying drinks.\n\n\"I'm a great advocate of doing business with your partner,\" she said in a Porter interview in 2018. \"Being married is actually the most fun ever, life got way more fun somehow. I have a responsibility being someone's wife, I want to be better.\"\n\nShe has also said that they remain best friends, and they have a strict rule: they don't spend more than three weeks apart from each other. And if they do have to be travel alone, they talk on the phone all the time. Robbie says that, even though Ackerley is behind the camera, he's a loud and outgoing person who loves to talk to everyone.\n\nAlthough Robbie is largely private about her marriage, it's clear that she is head over heels for Ackerley and much of her success wouldn't be possible without him. This couple joins the ranks of some of the cutest duos in Hollywood, like Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher, Chris Pratt and Katherine Schwarzenegger, and Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds. Many people are waiting for Robbie and Ackerley to have children, but she has made it clear that she isn't in any rush. Still, their kids would be the absolute cutest, so her fans are waiting patiently.\n\nEvie deserves to be heard. Support our cause and help women reclaim their femininity by subscribing today."

    "text": "Saltburn is produced by Margot Robbie, who is currently making waves in Hollywood with her latest film, Barbie. Robbie is co-producing Saltburn with Emerald Fennell. It's all about a British upmarket mystery thriller starring Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, and Rosamund Pike. Meanwhile, Emerald Fennell even appears in the latter as the pregnant Barbie, Midge. So, if you like Promising Young Woman and the other films Margot Robbie has produced and are looking forward to Saltburn, here is everything we know so far.\n\nALSO READ: Barbie: Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling starrer coming to THESE OTT platforms; Here's where you can stream\n\nWhat is Saltburn all about?\n\nSaltburn, which takes place in the mid-2000s, has been characterized as a wicked narrative of luxury and desire that examines England's aristocratic upper society in a dark and captivating drama of infatuation with a soundtrack of early 21st century pop bangers.\n\nSpecific narrative aspects have been kept under wraps since the film is billed as a mystery in which we learn things alongside the characters; therefore, it's wise not to go too deeply into the storyline. But we do know that Barry Keoghan portrays Oliver Quick, an Oxford undergraduate who, unable to form his own clique, falls in love with Felix Catton, portrayed by Jacod Elordi. Felix invites Oliver to his aristocratic family home, Saltburn, for a memorable summer with his quirky family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Fennell is well qualified to convey a narrative like this because the film is likely based on her real-life experiences. Fennell's father, British jeweler Theo Fennell, is an opulent figure in British high society, and she herself attended the most expensive private school in the UK. She even notably played Queen consort Camila Shand in Netflix's The Crown's third season.\n\nWhat is the cast and release date of Saltburn?\n\nSaltburn has been selected for the coveted opening slot of the BFI London Film Festival and will make its debut on October 4, 2023, as part of the festival's 67th edition. MGM will release the picture in the United States. However, it will only be available in limited theaters during Thanksgiving weekend, November 24. It will later be released globally over the following weekend.\n\nSaltburn is scheduled to have a theater run late into the holiday season, right up to Christmas, as Fennell's Promising Young Woman did during the 2021 epidemic and was one of the few movies to have something resembling a successful theatrical run. However, because MGM [owned by Amazon Studios] is releasing the picture, it might be accessible on Prime Video in time for the Academy Awards.\n\nSaltburn has an exceptional star cast, as Barry Keoghan and Jacob Elordi lead an amazing ensemble cast in Saltburn. Keoghan is fresh off his first Academy Award nomination for his role as the charming local dimwit Dominic in The Banshees of Inisherin, and the Irish actor known for his roles in hit films like Eternals and The Batman will aim to get his second mention. Meanwhile, Elordi also has a busy year ahead of him since he will play Elvis Presley in Sofia Coppola's highly anticipated biopic Priscilla.\n\nALSO READ: Barbie: Margot Robbie finally breaks her silence on Internet's fascination with her feet; Here's what she said"

Please enlighten,\" she further added.\n\nLisa is not the only one to call out the film! Prior to her, Juhi Parmar, Jay Bhanushali, Mira Kapoor and Sona Mohapatra had expressed their disappointment with the Greta Gerwig film.\n\nAbout Barbie\n\nDirected by Greta Gerwig, Barbie is the first live-action Barbie film! Starring Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, the film follows the duo on a journey of self-discovery after their expulsion from the utopian Barbie Land.

The Independent gave the film five stars, calling it \u201ca near-miraculous achievement\u201d.\n\nDirector Greta Gerwig co-wrote the film with her husband, director Noah Baumbach, with producer Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling playing the lead roles.\n\nThe film has many laugh-out-loud moments, many of which involve Gosling\u2019s performance as Ken, but one joke involving Barbie left a bad taste in the mouths of many audience members.\n\nIt arrives when Barbie is having an existential crisis upon her return to Barbieland, where she discovers it\u2019s been taken over by the Kens.\n\nWhile at the house of \u201cweird\u201d Barbie (Kate McKinnon), she emotionally tells human charcater Gloria (America Ferrera): \u201cI\u2019m not pretty anymore. I\u2019m not \u2018stereotypical Barbie\u2019 pretty.\u201d\n\nHere, the narrator (Helen Mirren) can be heard saying: \u201cNote to the filmmakers: Margot Robbie is the wrong person to cast if you want to make this point.\u201d\n\nIt seems this joke failed to impress many, who otherwise enjoyed the film, but are expressing their frustrations with the quip on social media. They\u2019re making their views known following a response to a post by @PopBase, asking: \u201cWhat was your favourite part of #Barbie?\u201d, in which one fan namechecked this narration highlighting Robbie\u2019s looks.\n\n\u201cI actually hated that and it made the scene less impactful to me,\u201d one person wrote in disagreement, with another adding: \u201cLiterally THE worst moment in the film. horrifically unfunny and pathetically self-apologetic. self-awareness doesn\u2019t make the choice any better.\u201d\n\nAn additional viewer waded in: \u201cThis was the only part of the movie I would have changed actually. Just because someone is gorgeous doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t FEEL unpretty.\u201d\n\nHowever, some argued that the scene was effective as Mirren\u2019s narration was the precise thought that came into their head just before the line was spoken.\n\n\u201cIt was literally perfect because that\u2019s EXACTLY what I was telling myself,\u201d one person replied, calling it \u201cgenius\u201d.\n\nBarbie is in cinemas now."

    "text": "The live action Barbie movie has definitely restored the summer box office to the (Barbie) pink of its health. Having already earned more than 300 million dollars, the film is slated to become one of the highest earners in Hollywood history. While the success of this fantasy comedy is superficially attributed to its ensemble cast and its impeccable direction, there is so much more to its appeal.\n\nHere goes a list of things that the filmmakers did phenomenally well to make Barbie an endearing and enthralling watch for generations to come.\n\n1) The Album\n\nProduced by Mark Ronson, the soundtrack of the Margot Robbie starrer is full of songs that convey profound emotions in a barbie-esque fashion but still manage to be extremely visceral in their depiction of our quotidian struggles as human beings. With songs ranging from the groovy 'WATATI' sung by Karol G and Aldo Ranks to the highly relatable ' What Was I \u200bMade For' by Billie Eilish, the Barbie album has something for everyone.\n\nImpressively enough, the line-up of the artists is quite diverse too, and it is certain that listeners across all age groups will be able to find a new favorite from the track list.\n\n2) Strategic Brand Collaborations\n\nFrom Airbnb to Burger King, from Aldo to Dragon Glassware, the list of brands that have doused their commodities and services in shades of pink popularised only by Barbie does not seem to end. These astute promotional tie-ups not only gave the movie unparalleled visibility but also ensured great profits for the companies that hopped onto the bandwagon.\n\nIt is not an exaggeration to say that the greatest blockbuster this year is not the live action Barbie movie itself but its marketing team. Special mention to 'Barbeinheimer' memes, Ryan Gosling's GQ interview titled 'Ken Things Ryan Gosling Can't Live Without' and the Barbie dreamhouse tour by none other than the on-screen Barbie, Margot Robbie herself.\n\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b3) The Iconic Costumes\n\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bThe costume department headed by the Academy- award winning designer, Jacqueline Durran, took inspiration from Barbie's outfits over the years to replicate the same looks in the film. This gave the whole movie a nostalgic undertone and was highly instrumental in heightening its allure. Be it the evergreen stripped swimsuit from the 1950s or the skater look from the 1990s, the outfits donned by Margot Robbie in the movie will be remembered for ages to come due to the keen attention to detail that went into making them.\n\n4) The Diverse Movie Cast\n\nThe film has garnered appreciation for including actors like Simu Liu (as Ken #2) and \u200b\u200b\u200bRitu Arya(as journalist Barbie) as they come from communities that are not showcased enough on-screen . The cast also features Ncuti Gatwa, America Ferrera and Issa Rae alongside other notable actors. Their roles in the movie are seen as stepping stones to better representation of minorities in the mainstream media.\n\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b5) Saying it Right\n\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Movies with a message, especially ones with a feminist subtext, can be considered \"preachy\" if not done right. Barbie breaks all barriers though and deftly makes pertinent and nuanced points about the subjugation of women, belongingness and loss of innocence. The film does not turn into a sermon at any point in the movie. The Greta Grewig directorial balances wholesomeness, hilarity and profoundness in equal measures, justifying its over the peak popularity.\n\nBarbie, in most respects, is the film of the year due to the team that made it happen. So do not wait any further, buy those movie tickets, grab a popcorn, sit back and relax as the Barbie movie takes you to the Barbie world while never losing its hold on reality.\n\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b"

    "text": "Barbie is officially the highest-grossing film of its main star Margot Robbie's Hollywood career. The Greta Gerwig-directed film surpassed David Ayer's directorial 2016 DC movie Suicide Squad to achieve this feat. Note that it is different from James Gunn's 2021 movie The Suicide Squad, which also starred Robbie. While Suicide Squad ended its theatrical run with a sum of $746.84 million, Barbie has grossed $780.71 million until now, still going strong. As per estimates, it is slated to end its theatrical run at $1 billion plus. The film is based on the iconic children's toy of the same name. The cast is absolutely stacked, and features names like Ryan Gosling, America Ferrera, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, Rhea Perlman, and Will Ferrell.\n\nWhat was Suicide Squad all about?\n\nSuicide Squad revolved around a secret government agency called Task Force X, led by Amanda Waller (played by Viola Davis). Waller assembled a group of dangerous and imprisoned supervillains with unique abilities, offering them a chance at redemption in exchange for participating in covert and dangerous missions. The team, known as the Suicide Squad, included characters such as Floyd Lawton/Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Robbie), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), and others. The team was sent on a mission to stop the ancient and mystical entity known as Enchantress (Cara Delevingne), who had taken control of archaeologist Dr June Moone's body. Enchantress intended to destroy humanity and rule over the world with her powerful abilities. Despite a pretty decent collection at the box office, the film was termed a failure due to its high budget and poor reviews.\n\nWhat is Barbie all about?\n\nBarbie follows the story of the titular doll who goes on a journey of self-discovery into the real world, after she discovers small imperfections in her previously-perfect life. Ken joins her on the journey. In the real world, they encounter issues of beauty standards and societal expectations. Barbie, Ken, and her owner, Sasha, confront their insecurities and societal pressures, leading to a transformation in Barbieland's social structure. Barbie decides to become human and embraces an ever-evolving identity in the real world.\n\nBarbie review\n\nWION's Shomini Sen wrote in her review of Barbie, \"I would still say that the film very smartly shows how society is and humanises the iconic doll. For decades Barbie has been one of the most popular toys for young girls, setting unrealistic standards of beauty. Sure, Mattel has reinvented the doll and made every girl believe that they can be whatever they want to be - just like their favourite doll, but the narrative of everything being overtly perfect has also done damage to several. Greta, in that sense, spins the narrative and adds a layer of cynicism to Barbieland to show how things are in real. Flawed, depressed, and definitely not perfect- even though the plastic remains constant.\"\n\nWATCH WION LIVE HERE"

But even when she was doing this film, she had been a fierce woman who did shy away from shoving Leo out of her light during their s*x scene. Needless to say, the actor was shocked by her behaviour of Margot, but it was funny overall, as the actress recalled in an interview.\n\nDirected by Martin Scorsese, the film came out in 2013 and is like a cult classic like the movie; its behind-the-scenes incidents are equally famous and endless. From getting several cuts from having s*x on a pile of cash to losing an e-cigarette in the b*tt crack, a lot of things have happened.\n\nMargot Robbie, who was in her early twenties when she did the Wolf of Wall Street movie, in an interview with Manhattan magazine about the time when she pushed Leonardo DiCaprio on one side while filming a s*x scene. She recalled, \u201cWe were positioned while they lit around us in one scene, and I kind of pushed Leo\u2019s head to one side and told him he was in my light, and he moved out of [it].\u201d\n\nMargot Robbie continued, \u201cHe was so incredulous that I had told him to get out of my light and physically moved him out of the way, he was like, \u2018Did you really just do that?'\u201d She continued, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone has told him to get out of their light in quite some time,\u201d she added. \u201cHe seemed extremely [shocked], but it was kind of funny.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Barbie star also added how working with Leonardo DiCaprio pushed her in a good way. She said, \u201cWorking with Leo challenged me every single second\u2014the challenge just to keep up with him pushed me and got my acting to a level it\u2019s never been, which is incredibly satisfying,\u201d she said, calling the experience \u201ca dream come true.\u201dHe\u2019s always been my favorite actor.\u201d\n\nOn the work front now, Margot Robbie\u2019s current film Barbie has been running successfully in the theatres and for more such throwbacks, stay tuned to Koimoi!\n\nMust Read: Spider-Man: Beyond The Spider-Verse Vanishes Indefinitely, The Kraven The Hunter Delayed For 10 Months \u2013 Sony X Marvel Release Calendar Goes Through Massive Shuffle\n\nFollow Us: Facebook | Instagram | Twitter | Youtube | Google News"

    "text": "In the three weeks since its debut in theaters, \"Barbie\" has surpassed $1 billion in global ticket sales, marking a historic moment for the film industry as it becomes the first movie directed solely by a woman to hit this box office milestone.\n\nGreta Gerwig, who directed \"Barbie,\" joins a small group of people who have the sole directing credit on a billion-dollar movie in Hollywood's history. She now holds the box office record for women directors, which Patty Jenkins last set with \"Wonder Woman\" in 2017. That film raked in more than $800 million.\n\n\"Barbie\" has earned about $1.03 billion worldwide as of Sunday, according to Box Office Mojo. The feminist film, which Gerwig directed and co-wrote after previously receiving Oscar nominations for her earlier films \"Lady Bird\" and \"Little Women,\" already broke one major record. It had the biggest opening weekend for a women director ever, according to Fandango managing editor Erik Davis.\n\n\"Barbie\" added another $53 million from 4,178 North American locations this weekend according to studio estimates on Sunday. The Margot Robbie-led and produced film has been comfortably seated in first place for three weeks and it's hardly finished yet.\n\nA digital advertisement board displaying a Barbie movie poster is seen in New York on July 24, 2023. Selcuk Acar/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n\nIn modern box office history, just 53 movies have made over $1 billion, not accounting for inflation, and \"Barbie\" is now the biggest to be directed by one woman, supplanting \"Wonder Woman's\" $821.8 million global total. Three movies that were co-directed by women are still ahead of \"Barbie,\" including \"Frozen\" ($1.3 billion) and \"Frozen 2\" ($1.45 billion) both co-directed by Jennifer Lee and \"Captain Marvel\" ($1.1 billion), co-directed by Anna Boden. But, \"Barbie\" has passed \"Captain Marvel\" domestically with $459.4 million (versus $426.8 million), thereby claiming the North American record for live-action movies directed by women.\n\nNew competition came this weekend in the form of the animated, PG-rated \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\" and the Jason Statham shark sequel, \"Meg 2: The Trench,\" both of which were neck-in-neck with Christopher Nolan's \"Oppenheimer,\" also in its third weekend, for the second-place spot.\n\n\"Meg 2\" managed to sneak ahead and land in second place. It overcame its abysmal reviews to score a $30 million opening weekend from 3,503 locations. The Warner Bros. release, directed by Ben Wheatley, currently has a 29% critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes and a B- CinemaScore from audiences. The thriller was released in 3D, which accounted for 22% of its first weekend business.\n\nThird place went to \"Oppenheimer,\" which added $28.7 million from 3,612 locations in North America, bringing its domestic total to $228.6 million. In just three weeks, the J. Robert Oppenheimer biopic starring Cillian Murphy has become the highest grossing R-rated film of the year (ahead of \"John Wick Chapter 4\") and the sixth-biggest of the year overall, surpassing \"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.\"\n\n\"Oppenheimer\" also celebrated a landmark, crossing $500 million globally in three weeks. Its worldwide tally is currently $552.9 million, which puts it ahead of \"Dunkirk,\" which clocked out with $527 million in 2017, and has become Nolan's fifth-biggest movie ever. It's also now among the four top grossing biographies ever (company includes \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" \"The Passion of the Christ\" and \"American Sniper\") and the biggest World War II movie of all time.\n\nParamount's \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" was close behind in fourth place with an estimated $28 million from 3,858 theaters in North America. Since opening on Wednesday, the film, which is riding on excellent reviews (96% on Rotten Tomatoes) and audience scores, has earned $43.1 million.\n\n\"This is one of those movies that is a multigenerational joy,\" said Chris Aronson, Paramount's president of domestic distribution. \"I think the enduring popularity of 'Turtles' is showing its true colors. And there hasn't been an animated film in eight weeks and there won't be another for eight weeks which is great for us.\"\n\n\"Turtles\" cost $70 million to produce and features a starry voice cast that includes Jackie Chan, Ice Cube, Paul Rudd, Ayo Edebiri and Seth Rogen, who produced and co-wrote the film, which leans into the \"teenage\" aspect of the turtles.\n\n\"Barbie,\" \"Oppenheimer\" and even the surprise, anti-trafficking hit \"Sound of Freedom\" (now at $163.5 million and ahead of \"Mission: Impossible 7\") have helped fuel a boom at the box office, bringing in many millions more than was expected and helping to offset pains caused by some summer disappointments.\n\n\"After 'The Flash,' 'Indiana Jones' and, to a certain extent, 'Mission: Impossible,' people were saying the summer was a disappointment. But it's not over yet,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \"We're going to have a summer that is going to go out on a high note.\"\n\nBut the moment of triumph for the industry will likely be short lived if the studios can't reach an agreement with striking actors and writers soon. The fall release calendar has already gotten slimmer, with some studios pushing films into 2024 instead of trying to promote them without movie stars.\n\nSony had planned to release its PlayStation-inspired true story \"Gran Turismo\" in theaters nationwide next Friday, but will now be rolling it out slowly for two weeks before going wide on Aug. 25. The thinking? If movie stars can't promote the film, maybe audiences can.\n\n\"We have to be realistic,\" Dergarabedian said. \"We're on this emotional high of movies doing so well, but we have to temper our enthusiasm and optimism with the fact that the strike is creating a lot of uncertainty. The longer it goes on the more profound the issues become. But the audience has spoken and they love going to the movie theater.\"\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.\n\n1. \"Barbie,\" $53 million.\n\n2. \"Meg 2: The Trench,\" $30 million.\n\n3. \"Oppenheimer,\" $28.7 million.\n\n4. \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,\" $28 million.\n\n5. \"Haunted Mansion,\" $9 million.\n\n6. \"Sound of Freedom,\" $7 million.\n\n7. \"Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part I,\" $6.5 million.\n\n8. \"Talk to Me,\" $6.3 million.\n\n9. \"Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani,\" $1.5 million.\n\n10. \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,\" $1.5 million."

The film surpassed Christopher Nolan's \"The Dark Knight,\" which generated $536 million in 2008, for the title.\n\nThe bubblegum pink collaboration between filmmaker Greta Gerwig, Mattel and Warner Bros. has collected more than $1.2 billion at the global box office since its July 21 release.\n\nIt is the first billion-dollar film for the newly minted Warner Bros.

Alongside Nolan's latest feature \"Oppenheimer,\" which has grossed more than $250 million domestically, \"Barbie\" proves that moviegoers are still interested in leaving their couches for quality films and unique communal experiences.\n\nThe Margot Robbie-led film has been number one at the box office since its debut and is on track to be the highest-grossing film of the year. Box office analysts expect \"Barbie\" to continue to collect box office receipts in the weeks to come, as it faces limited competition from new releases and rides a wave of positive word of mouth.\n\nDisclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC."

But suddenly, it\u2019s like, \u2018No, we\u2019ve cared about Ken this whole time.\u2019 No, you didn\u2019t,\" the \"La La Land\" star said. \"You never did. You never cared. Barbie never f----- with Ken. That\u2019s the point.\"\n\n\"If you ever really cared about Ken, you would know that nobody cared about Ken. So your hypocrisy is exposed,\" Gosling added.\n\nOSCAR-WINNING SCREENWRITER LEFT FAILED SONY \u2018BARBIE\u2019 MOVIE BECAUSE STUDIO WANTED \u2018GIRL-BOSS FEMINIST TWIST'\n\nThe tagline for the poster does indicate that Ken doesn\u2019t have as much going on as Barbie. It reads, \"She\u2019s everything. He\u2019s just Ken.\"\n\nNSFW French Poster\n\nThe film's tagline caused a stir when it was translated for the French poster, going viral for a dirtier meaning that may or may not have been intended.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, the tagline in French reads, \"Elle peut tout faire. Lui, c\u2019est juste Ken\" \u2013 meaning \"She can do everything. He\u2019s just Ken,\" a fairly close match to the original English.\n\nHowever, \"Ken\" has a double meaning in French slang, meaning the f-word, making the tagline \"She can do everything. He just knows how to f---.\"\n\nWhether or not the double entendre was intentional is up for debate, but, according to a French marketing executive from a different studio who spoke with THR, there was no other way for it to be taken.\n\n\"It\u2019s definitely deliberate; there\u2019s no way a French speaker wouldn\u2019t have noticed the dirty pun,\" they said. \"It\u2019s sort of genius, really, that they slipped that in.\"\n\nIn a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, Warner Bros. Discovery said, \"The speculation around the Barbie marketing campaign shows that there is a high level of awareness and major excitement from the public surrounding the upcoming release of our film in France. We can\u2019t wait for audiences around the world to see the film upon its release next month.\"\n\nWARNER BROS. DENIES 'BARBIE' MAP ENDORSES CHINA'S DISPUTED TERRITORIAL CLAIMS: 'MAKE-BELIEVE'\n\n\"Barbie\" Banned in Vietnam\n\nEarlier this month, \"Barbie\" was banned in Vietnam due to a scene featuring a map that shows China\u2019s unilaterally claimed territory in the South China Sea, which the country said violates their sovereignty.\n\nAccording to Variety, the director general of the Vietnam Cinema Department told the state-run newspaper Tuoi Tre, \"We do not grant license for the movie 'Barbie' to release in Vietnam because it contains the offending image of the nine-dash line.\"\n\nThe controversial \"nine dash line\" is used on maps to illustrate China's claims over areas of the South China Sea, including portions Vietnam considers its own. In 2016, The Hague ruled the line invalid, and, according to Variety, while the resolution is binding, China has said it does not recognize the decision.\n\nA Warner Bros. Film Group spokesperson told Variety, \"The map in Barbie Land is a child-like crayon drawing. The doodles depict Barbie\u2019s make-believe journey from Barbie Land to the \u2018real world.\u2019 It was not intended to make any type of statement.\"\n\nThe government in the Philippines also considered banning the film over the drawing but decided against it.\n\nCHINA REACTS AFTER 'BARBIE' MOVIE DEPICTS CONTROVERSIAL MAP FAVORED BY BEIJING\n\nAccording to THR, the country\u2019s Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTPCB) said in a letter released to the public that the board found there was \"no basis to ban the film.\"\n\nIt did request the image be blurred to ensure audiences wouldn\u2019t \"misinterpret\" the scene.\n\nThe overall plot of \"Barbie\" will follow Robbie\u2019s main Barbie character as she experiences an existential crisis and visits the real world in a journey of self-discovery, accompanied by Gosling\u2019s Ken.\n\nWoke \"Barbie\"\n\nThe world of \"Barbie\" is populated with an all-star cast playing a wide variety of Barbies and Kens, including \"Insecure\" star Issa Rae, \"SNL\u2019s\" Kate McKinnon, and Marvel star Simu Liu.\n\nLiu spoke about the diverse array of dolls come to life in an interview with Screenrant\u2019s Joe Deckelmeier in July, highlighting how the movie challenges \"heteronormative\" ideas about gender.\n\n\"You know, colors became gendered, toys became gendered, there were all these rules that were imposed on us,\" he said. \"So, Barbie was always like, \u2018Oh that\u2019s not my toy. That\u2019s on the other toy\u2019. And I\u2019m so glad that this movie exists because I think it puts the final nail in the coffin of that very heteronormative idea of what gender is, and what is or is not gendered. How can you make a color gendered, you know?\"\n\n\"That\u2019s, I think, what\u2019s really struck me about being in this movie, what\u2019s evolved in my understanding of Barbie and what it is, and what I hope that an audience will get from it when they watch the movie,\" he added.\n\n'BARBIE' ACTRESS KATE MCKINNON CLAIMS FILM SHOWS HOW 'GENDER ROLES DENY PEOPLE HALF THEIR HUMANITY'\n\n\"Barbie\" also features transgender actress Hari Nef, who told Out Magazine the movie has an empowering message about being transgender.\n\n\"As much as there\u2019s a celebration of femininity and being a girl in this [movie], I think there\u2019s also an encouragement of letting go of the checklist we ascribe to living and living your life and being in your body your way, on your own terms,\" Nef said.\n\nThe faith-based film review site, Movieguide, took issue with what they consider an abandonment of the core audience for a Barbie doll movie, families and young girls, in favor of LGBTQ stories.\n\n\"The new BARBIE movie forgets its core audience of families and children while catering to nostalgic adults and pushing lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender character stories. Furthermore, the movie was poorly made with multiple premises, losing even the most die-hard fans,\" a review written by the site\u2019s staff said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nIt continued, \"They had a built-in market and audience for this franchise that they completely ignored. Millions of families would have turned out to the theaters and purchased tickets, but instead, Mattel chose to cater to a small percentage of the population who has proven over and over to abandon the box office.\"\n\nRobbie did not address that specific review, but said in a recent interview with ABC News Australia that the movie is meant for all audiences.\n\nShe was asked if the movie was for kids, and Robbie answered, \"This is such a thing people say when they do press for a movie. They\u2019re like, \u2018It\u2019s for everyone.\u2019 But it was literally crafted to be for everyone.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe film's co-writer and director, Greta Gerwig, described the film to the outlet as \"feminist,\" but in a broader definition.\n\n\"It's feminist in a way that includes everyone. It's a rising tide lifts all boats version of it,\" Gerwig said.\n\nFox News Digital\u2019s Kristine Parks and Gabriel Hays contributed to this report."

    "text": "Many current TV shows and movies are reboots of existing franchises. Why has this one been so culturally omnipresent?\n\nThe marketers at Warner Bros are being touted as geniuses, credited with the blockbuster success of the Barbie movie. The movie has already grossed $1 billion in box office sales, with a marketing spend estimated at $150 million and a similar cost for the movie. It\u2019s a great ROI but there are other important factors contributing to the movie\u2019s success.\n\nThe real genius was the writer who understood and validated our powerful mixed feelings about Barbie. We loved her, idolized her, chopped off her hair, made fun of her, and felt a little icky about the stereotypes and gender roles she represents.\n\nBarbie is the number-one girls\u2019 brand in the world, and has been for most of her 50-year lifespan. When I worked as a brand manager on Barbie, we were selling a Barbie doll every second, and girls received, on average, five Barbie dolls per year. Mattel reports that more than 90% of girls own a Barbie. Their long-term marketing investment had built up a $700 million brand valuation before the movie released, and this brand has an emotional engagement that translates really well to a film. Many girls play with Barbies every day, telling stories and imagining themselves as Barbie. I can think of no other brand that approaches this level of reach and depth of engagement.\n\nThe core movie audience is anyone who used to play with Barbie\u201490% of women and our teenage daughters. But the real genius was the writer who understood and validated our powerful mixed feelings about Barbie. We loved her, idolized her, chopped off her hair, made fun of her, and felt a little icky about the stereotypes and gender roles she represents. The trailer promises, \u201cIf you love Barbie, this movie is for you. If you hate Barbie, this movie is for you.\u201d The secret is that we feel both ways.\n\nAlong with the brand value and emotional engagement, the crossover adult/teen targeting made possible the biggest co-branding and licensing coup in\u2026the history of the world, maybe? Warner Brothers and Mattel fully capitalized their crossover licensing opportunities\u2014toys, adult fashion, car insurance, you name it. The theater where I watched the movie was promoting a Barbie-branded pink gin cocktail. (It was pretty good.) Airbnb partnered on an actual Barbie Dream House in Malibu.\n\nPart of the appeal of partnering with Warner Bros. to promote this film was that it wasn\u2019t already a franchise. The release of the first live-action Barbie movie marked a historic moment that would be covered in news outlets, not just entertainment media. So unlike Indiana Jones and Mission Impossible, Barbie offered a significant publicity opportunity. And who doesn\u2019t want to make history?\n\nDid the movie and its marketing represent something new for how Barbie presents women?\n\nAlthough the film is a lot of fun, I left with mixed feelings. Mattel has always wanted moms to think of Barbie as a strong and inclusive role model, and the film reinforces those brand characteristics. But at her core, Barbie has been and will always be about materialism. She\u2019s a fashion doll and Mattel releases a new line of Barbie products every six months that they really want you to buy. You buy Barbie new clothes, do her hair, dress her up. You play that she\u2019s shopping with her friends. If your parents are rich, maybe she gets to live in the $179 house she dreams of. If your parents are woke, maybe she has a non-White, differently abled sidekick to go shopping with. But blonde, skinny, White, stereotypical Barbie will always be the star. Her feet will always be pointy, her waist will always be tiny, and she will always be about looking beautiful and having things. Don\u2019t get me wrong; girls enjoy playing with Barbies this way. It\u2019s fun. But it\u2019s definitely not feminism.\n\nAre there lessons for how brands can refresh other cultural products with a strong but possibly outdated image?\n\nThe Barbie one-two punch that some legacy brands could copy is to poke fun at themselves, then deliver a message that feels timely and relevant.\n\nIn the first half of the film, the audience is laughing at everything about Barbie world. Her silly feet, her airhead boyfriend Ken, his feeling so unnecessary (because he is). The filmmakers embrace the cringe, and we love them for it. After laughing at and along with Barbie, we become open-minded. Then America Ferrera nails the landing with her un-brainwashing speech, \u201cIt is literally impossible to be a woman.\u201d We relate to everything she says. We wouldn\u2019t have associated those ideas with Barbie (not at all!) but now we\u2019re actually listening. Humor does that. Ferrera\u2019s words work like a magic spell on the Barbies, waking them from the fog of patriarchy. The real magic it works is on us though, making us think Barbie might be kind of cool after all."

    "text": "In one of the most highly-anticipated movies of summer 2023, Barbie not only brings Barbieland to life, but it also features several incredible cameos. For one, America Ferrera\u2019s real-life husband, Ryan Piers Williams, actually starred as her on-screen husband in the Warner Bros. Pictures film. The movie follows Barbie\u2019s (played by Margot Robbie) journey into the real world, where she meets Ferrera\u2019s character Gloria, an employee of Mattel toy company, and her teenage daughter, Sasha (played by Ariana Greenblatt). The mother and daughter partner with one another to help Barbie return to Barbieland.\n\nDavid M. Benett / Getty Images\n\nWhile leaving the real world, Gloria wonders if her husband would care that she left and if he would be fine without her. Then, the movie shows Gloria\u2019s spouse practicing Spanish, completely unaware that his wife and daughter are heading to a different dimension. It turns out that Gloria\u2019s husband is actually Ferrera\u2019s actual husband in real life.\n\nAt the end of the movie, Ferrera's husband also makes another appearance as her character Gloria's spouse. In the scene, Williams\u2019 character is shown sitting in a car with Gloria, Sasha, and Barbie, attempting to tell Barbie in Spanish that he's proud of her. \u201cEstoy orgullosa de ti,\u201d he tells her. He also says, \u201cS\u00ed se puede,\u201d which is a reference to Gotta Kick It Up!, Ferrera\u2019s 2002 Disney Channel movie, according to Today.\n\nFerrera managed to keep her husband\u2019s role in the movie a secret, but she gave subtle hints on social media. On July 13, 2023, Ferrera promoted Barbie by posting a photo with her husband posing on a pink carpet during the movie\u2019s premiere. \u201cMy favorite & forever Ken, you cute\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udc95,\u201d she wrote in her caption. Later, some fans picked up on the fact that the couple brought their real-life romance to the motion picture. \u201cYour real husband played your movie husband?!\u201d one fan asked. Another commented, \u201cI loved his cameo role he was so funny \ud83d\ude02.\u201d Williams uploaded a similar photo from the premiere along with a supportive message to his wife. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for you all to see America in this film! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udd25 #barbieworld,\u201d he said. Some of his friends and followers flocked to the comments section to share positive opinions on his role after watching the movie, which premiered on July 21, 2023. \u201cCan't lie, a certain cameo was the highlight for me \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude01,\u201d one person wrote.\n\nAccording to The Cut, director Greta Gerwig wrote Gloria\u2019s part with partner Noah Baumbach after being a fan of Ugly Betty. In October 2022, Ferrera told People that her children, Sebastian Piers and Lucia Marisol, weren\u2019t aware that their parents would be acting together in the box office recording-breaking film since they are five and three years old. \u201cThey don\u2019t really have any context for it,\u201d the actress explained. \u201cSo, one day [they might care], but not now. They\u2019re still too young.\u201d\n\nFerrera and Williams first met in 2005 while the actress was a student a the University of Southern California and a rising star in Hollywood. At the time, Williams cast Ferrera in his first short film called \u201cMuertas.\u201d They started dating shortly after, and five years later, Williams popped the question. The following year, the two of them tied the knot. Although the pair is proud parents to two children, they keep most of their family life off of social media."

But \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d in which Cillian Murphy portrays the father of the atomic bomb, has also stood its ground, making $648 million globally \u2014 an amazing feat for a three-hour-long film based on a historical figure.\n\nThough \u201cBarbie\u201d has held tightly onto the No. 1 spot at the domestic box office since its release, \u201cOppenheimer\u201d has fought its way to the top in other major markets, including India and Hong Kong.

    "text": "TOKYO, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Hollywood blockbuster \"Barbie\" hit theatres in Japan on Friday, where \"Barbenheimer\" memes linking the doll-themed film with the atomic bomb caused a stir and made distributor Warner Bros (WBD.O) apologise ahead of the release.\n\nTickets for \"Barbie\", starring Margot Robbie in the title role, nevertheless sold fast in Japan as fans flocked to the theatrical release, timed to coincide with a national holiday marking the first day of Japan's extended summer holiday week.\n\n\"The pink world of Barbie was absolutely beautiful,\" said Misaki Suzuki, 29-year-old nail salon worker, after watching the film at a Tokyo cinema.\n\n\"Barbie\" has topped $1 billion in global box office since its July 21 debut, making writer and director Greta Gerwig the first female filmmaker to surpass that benchmark as a solo director. The success of the fantasy-comedy was further boosted by the coupling with \"Oppenheimer\", the biopic chronicling the creation of the atomic bomb during World War Two that opened on the same weekend.\n\nBut the \"Barbenheimer\" combo sparked a backlash in Japan, as the nation earlier this month marked the memorials of the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki 78 years ago.\n\nIn now-deleted posts on platform X, formerly known as Twitter, Warner Bros' \"Barbie\" marketing account had latched on to fan-produced memes that depicted Robbie with \"Oppenheimer\" actor Cillian Murphy alongside images of nuclear blasts.\n\nA Change.org petition was launched on Aug 1, demanding that Warner Bros and Universal Pictures, the studio behind \"Oppenheimer\", call a halt to the #Barbenheimer hashtag on social media. It has collected about 22,600 signatures to date.\n\nA #NoBarbenheimer hashtag trended in Japan at the time, prompting Warner's Japan division to issue a rare public criticism of its U.S. parent company, which then followed with an apology last week.\n\nMitsuki Takahata, who voiced Barbie in the dubbed Japanese version, said in an Aug 2 Instagram post that she was dismayed upon learning of the memes. \"This incident is really, really disappointing,\" she posted.\n\nStill, Japanese fans of the movie, which sends Mattel Inc's (MAT.O) iconic doll into real life, said the controversy did not discourage them from visiting theatres.\n\n\"It was harsh\", said 24-year-old university student Rie Takeda, commenting on the fan-produced #Barbenheimer memes.\n\n\"But the movie was radiant, beyond that I had fun\" watching it, she said.\n\nNo Japan release date has been announced for \"Oppenheimer\", which has been criticised for largely ignoring the atomic bomb's destruction of two major Japanese cities in 1945, accounting for more than 200,000 deaths.\n\nReporting by Kantaro Komiya and Akiko Okamoto; Additional reporting by Rocky Swift, Editing by William Maclean\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

    "text": "Mothering two imaginative girls, Jasmine and Natalie, I spent many years watching them play with Barbie dolls. Seeing their creative minds plan soir\u00e9es at the Barbie mansion, towering in a corner of Natalie\u2019s bedroom, was like watching a sitcom. Sometimes Ken and his friends were fortunate enough to make it out of the toy box to join the fun, but usually, it was all about the girls. From brunches to pool parties or road trips in luxury convertibles, my daughters\u2019 dolls lived well and without limitations.\n\nThis past Sunday, Natalie and I fancied up in cute, pink dresses for a grand outing we\u2019d been anticipating for months, the \u201cBarbie\u201d movie. She invited two of her own Barbies, Sasha and Marla, whom she and Jasmine used to play with, to go with us. During the drive to Malco Grandview Cinema & IMAX, she dressed them for the show.\n\nCruising down Lakeland to I-55, from Flowood to Madison, all four of us vibed in our pastel, floral prints while listening to Lizzo, Dua Lipa, Nikki Minaj, Ice Spice and Aqua. The only missing player was Jasmine, who lives in Detroit and had seen the movie three days earlier.\n\nAs we walked into Malco, Natalie and I instantly became participants in a cross-generational gathering of women with a cultural connection steeped in mutual stories and experiences. Each girl and woman self-represented in a communal fashion show featuring elaborate, colorful hairstyles; dresses ranging from casual to formal; Barbie T-shirts; pink shorts; and shoes symbolic of inclusivity\u2014heels, Converse, sandals and combat boots. It felt like a pre-party before the main event.\n\nThe hype was on the button.\n\nEvery second of the movie evinces brilliant writing, critical consciousness and cultural competence. The story of Barbie is contextualized in such a way that every victory for and atrocity against women is equally exhilarating and exhausting.\n\nBarbie\u2019s world is highly functional, productive and prosperous when women are in control and in charge of their own lives, without interference from a fragile, egotistical and overly sensitive patriarchy. Ensuing feelings of insecurity and personal inadequacy trigger male aggression and a scathing attack on women\u2019s personhood.\n\nMost disturbing is the real-world setback of women\u2019s rights playing out on America\u2019s national stage and systemic sabotaging of decades of hard labor.\n\nThe most ironic point in the movie comes when Ruth Handler\u2019s ghost makes the iconic statement, \u201cWe mothers stand still so our daughters can look back to see how far they have come.\u201d\n\nAs a mom, I watched the movie\u2019s hostile-takeover scenes, imagining myself in my daughter\u2019s shoes, young women stripped of rights that were guaranteed to me when I was their age. The clock\u2019s hands should not move backward.\n\nThrough mom lenses, the \u201cBarbie\u201d movie\u2019s celebration of women\u2019s landmark achievements and the opportunities available to my daughters energized me. Positions such as president, doctor, lawyer, and journalist were not as easily attainable for women when I was Jasmine\u2019s and Natalie\u2019s age. Although the writers spotlight progress to an extent, they are creative in reversing roles, presenting a world that excludes men, while also reflecting the disparaging circumstances we all face when any group is the target of gender inequality.\n\nToday\u2019s Barbie Symbolizes Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nI\u2019m old enough to have witnessed Barbie\u2019s transition from largely static to admirably variable. As a girl, I didn\u2019t own any Barbie dolls, just baby dolls, a problematic cultural standard once heavily forced onto girls, as addressed in the movie\u2019s introduction. My mother didn\u2019t have a problem with Barbies. Representation mattered to her. She insisted that all of my dolls look like me. To this day, I\u2019m grateful to her for caring about my identity formation.\n\nWhere I was growing up in Brookhaven, Miss., a Black Barbie doll on a toy store shelf did not come a dime a dozen. By the time I became a mother, a more relatable Barbie had emerged, one that I, unlike my mother, could comfortably introduce to Jasmine and Natalie.\n\nFortunately, my daughters experienced a Barbie culture inclusive of not only skin tones in their likeness, but also varying hair textures, facial features and body types. More importantly, Barbie became a symbol of diversity, equity and inclusion, encompassing the lives and stories of women from an increased intersectional perspective.\n\n\u201cBarbie\u201d the movie portrayed a group of women with lifestyles identical to Jasmine and Natalie\u2019s Barbie dolls. Watching the film, I thought about my little girls sitting on the floor with Barbie clothing, shoes, accessories, sports cars and other luxuries scattered about.\n\nAt certain points during the movie, I laughed and cried, rejoicing in knowing that my daughters were doing more than just playing with dolls. They were creating a world that young women owned\u2014their Barbies with no glass ceilings, no threats to their personhood. Sitting at the brunch tables, swimming at the pool parties and driving the colorful sports cars were professional Black women, happy and thriving. Through their engagement with Barbie dolls, my girls were creating a world that they were raised to believe is attainable for them.\n\nJasmine and Natalie are college-educated adults now. Neither is clueless to the obstacles set against them. Both are empowered to self-advocate and expect no less than what they have worked hard to attain. As their mom, I can say that every second of the \u201cBarbie\u201d movie resonated with me because our lives and stories were well-represented.\n\nThis MFP Voices essay does not necessarily represent the views of the Mississippi Journalism and Education Group, the Mississippi Free Press, its staff or board members.

    "text": "Press play to listen to this article Voiced by artificial intelligence.\n\nWelcome to Declassified, a weekly humor column.\n\nAn entirely plastic figure with no obvious genitalia and a blank expression who lives in a fabricated world \u2026 but enough about Donald Trump, let\u2019s talk about Barbie.\n\nAnything as popular as the Barbie movie has to get political, and that is what\u2019s happened. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak tweeted that his family had chosen \u201cBarbie\u201d ahead of the other big cinema release, \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d To be fair, Sunak has young daughters and the codes to actual nuclear weapons, so it was always likely to be \u201cBarbie\u201d that he chose to see first.\n\nHopefully, Sunak\u2019s children haven\u2019t seen the posters that have been popping up in London that cast senior members of the Conservative Party as characters in the Barbie film alongside attacks on their positions on immigration and a variation on the hashtag \u201cThisBarbieIs\u2026\u201d that ends with a word beginning with C that isn\u2019t exactly wholesome or suitable for a family publication (if indeed this is a family publication).\n\nNot everyone is as pro-\u201cBarbie\u201d as Sunak. Germany\u2019s health minister, Karl Lauterbach, announced that he wouldn\u2019t be going to see the movie, without specifying why. Germany was of course home to the Lilli doll, believed to be the inspiration for Barbie but which was a bigger, more curvaceous version of the American product and which originated on the pages of Bild (the bigger, more curvaceous version of this publication).\n\nAlso unhappy at \u201cBarbie\u201d was an American right-wing commentator, the permanently furious Ben Shapiro, who posted a 43-minute-long video (the film itself is only 113 minutes!) complaining about it.\n\n\u201cMy producers dragged me to see \u2018Barbie\u2019 and it was one of the most woke movies I have ever seen,\u201d Shapiro said, before adding: \u201cLet me begin with my generalized assessment of the movie. This movie is not just a piece of shit. This movie is a flaming piece of dogshit, piled atop an entire dumpster on fire, piled atop a landfill filled with dogshit.\u201d\n\nShapiro \u2014 who, lest you forget, is an actual adult \u2014 also threw a Barbie doll into a bin on top of some other Barbie dolls and set them on fire.\n\nIt was perhaps the oddest meltdown by someone from the American right since Tucker Carlson devoted an entire section of his TV show to complaining that M&Ms had gone woke and redesigned the cartoons used to advertise the candy to be \u201cless sexy,\u201d with the Green M&M swapping her boots for sneakers. That of course prompted the sadly unanswered question: \u201cDoes Tucker Carlson fancy multicolored button-shaped chocolate?\u201d\n\nCAPTION COMPETITION\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Star Wars\u2019 franchise finally runs out of steam and budget.\u201d\n\nCan you do better? Email [email protected] or on Twitter @pdallisonesque\n\nLast time we gave you this photo:\n\nThanks for all the entries. Here\u2019s the best from our postbag \u2014 there\u2019s no prize except for the gift of laughter, which I think we can all agree is far more valuable than cash or booze.\n\n\u201cThere she goes! That should make American economists think twice before trying to steal our jobs,\u201d by Tom Morgan"

Such restrictions have led to speculation that the movie might encounter similar challenges in countries like Brunei, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Taiwan.\n\nCritics suggest that the movie's themes and content might run afoul of local standards, values, and sensitivities, potentially leading to its prohibition in the UAE and Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhile no official confirmation has been provided to support these claims, the possibility of a Barbie-less summer in the Middle East has sparked concern among ardent fans."

But if not for arranging a last-minute Zoom call with the director, Cera might not have made it into the film.\n\n\u201cIt was a kind of very last-minute casting,\u201d Cera said in a video interview with GQ conducted before the actors strike. \u201cMy manager got a call checking on my availability for it, and he called me and he said, \u2018I got a call about this movie. It\u2019s the \u201cBarbie\u201d movie. Greta Gerwig\u2019s directing it, and it\u2019s filming in London for four months of something, so I told them you probably wouldn\u2019t want to to do it because you probably don\u2019t want to go to London.'\u201d\n\nCera continued, \u201cI was like, \u2018What! Call them back!\u2019 He didn\u2019t like blow it or anything, but he\u2019s like, \u2018I managed their expectations that you might not want to do it.\u2019 I was like, \u2018How can I not do it? I need to do it!'\u201d\n\nCera then took matters into his own hands.\n\n\u201cI somehow got Greta\u2019s email address, I think through a common friend of ours, and I emailed her like, \u2018Can I be in it? Can I do that part?'\u201d Cera said. \u201cAnd she was like, \u2018Let\u2019s get on a Zoom right now. Here\u2019s a Zoom link, I\u2019ll be on there for the next hour.\u2019 So she was just hanging out on the Zoom, like, \u2018Click the link whenever you\u2019re ready.\u2019 And then we talked about it, and it just all happened really fast from there.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cBarbie,\u201d Cera plays the shy, short-lived companion of Ken. While there are countless iterations of Ken, there is only one Allan.\n\n\u201cAllan is a sad figure. He\u2019s just a person that doesn\u2019t really have any place in the world,\u201d explained Cera.\n\nBut why did Mattel discontinue the doll?\n\nAccording to Cera, \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t selling. The world just didn\u2019t need for Ken to have a friend\u2026 Barbie is good, we can get a lot more Barbies in here, and friends of hers. But we\u2019ve got Ken, and we don\u2019t need to go deeper in that direction. So Allan fell by the wayside a little bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cBarbie\u201d recently surpassed Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d as Warner Bros.\u2019 highest-grossing domestic release in history, with over $537 million in the U.S. and Canada. The pink fantasia has collected more than $1.2 billion globally and has remained the No. 1 movie for four consecutive weeks.\n\nWatch Cera\u2019s full GQ interview below."

The Kumkum star took to Instagram with a lengthy note on Monday, calling out the \u2018inappropriate\u2019 film for its seemingly adult themes. The well known TV actor said that she had walked out of the theatre within mere minutes after going to watch the movie with her 10-year-old daughter.\n\nWhile Parmar acknowledged that she had not noticed the film was rated PG-13, she added that \"the language and content is inappropriate even for children 13 and above\".\n\n\u201c10 minutes into the movie, inappropriate language, sexual connotations and I was anxiously running out of the theater wondering what had I just exposed my child to. She had been waiting to watch your film and here I was just shocked, disappointed and heartbroken with what I had just exposed her to. I was the first one to walk out of the movie within 10-15 minutes and by the time I reached out, I saw other parents following with their little ones crying, while some parents chose to stay back to watch the entire movie,\" she wrote.\n\nThe remarks have not gone down well with netizens, many of whom urged Parmar to \u201cmaybe try watching the entire thing\" before forming an opinion.\n\n\u201cIn your entire post you give no example of what was even inappropriate in the movie. The reason it's PG-13 is because Barbie is a functioning adult and the movie has themes deeper than a child could ever understand. The only reason you're pissed is because they showed Barbie as an actual woman and not just the perfect idea you've been feeding your kids. If you watched the entire thing (with or without your kid) you would have been able to write a more intellectual review than whatever this post is,\" read one irate comment.\n\nI guess you need to understand that this movie is not adult because of why you have mentioned but because it talks about deeper themes like existential crisis, mental health, and patriarchy which might be too heavy for children to understand,\" wrote another.\n\n\u201cPlease do not bad mouth such a beautifully made movie just because you didn\u2019t do your research properly and mistook it to be some Disney movie,\" added another comment.\n\n\u201cIt's not the films job to parent your child. Read the ratings and take a call. Sensitive much? Barbie has always been sexualised, where have you been?\" wrote another individual.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)\n\nMilestone Alert!Livemint tops charts as the fastest growing news website in the world \ud83c\udf0f Click here to know more."

And now that the highly anticipated Barbie movie is finally out in theaters, we can safely confirm that the Barbiecore trend is here to stay. Need proof?

It transpired that Margot Robbie, who lived in London at the beginning of her film career, was a big follower of British comedy Gavin & Stacey, in which Brydon appeared as Uncle Bryn.\n\nThe actor told the newspaper: \u201cYou never know who\u2019s watching, do you? Margot loved Gavin & Stacey and a few years ago a friend of hers asked me to record a video message for her as Bryn. To be honest I\u2019d forgotten all about it, and then I get the call for Barbie, and the response to it has been extraordinary.\n\n\u201cI am not here to blow my own trumpet, but there is a lesson for young actors \u2014 do your best in every role. [Director] Greta Gerwig told me she was a fan of Human Remains [a BBC comedy, in which Brydon played seven different men going through various divorces, released back in 2000], which amazed me.\u201d\n\nOther names to join Brydon in Barbie include the new Doctor Who actor Ncuti Gatwa, Bridgerton\u2019s Nicola Coughlan and Sex Education star Emma Mackey. Dua Lipa also appears, as well as contributing to the soundtrack.\n\nBrydon told The Times he had eschewed American screen offers because he wanted to stay in the UK with his family.\n\n\u201cI am not prepared to make the sacrifices to make films or TV in Hollywood or Atlanta or Vancouver, wherever the tax breaks for filming are these days, because believe me there are sacrifices,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has to be something inside you that needs that level of success and fame.

    "text": "In a suite in Manhattan\u2019s Chelsea Hotel, Greta Gerwig\u2019s phone rings. \u2018Sail away, sail away, sail away,\u2019 it warbles, over familiar strings. \u2018Oh no. Sorry,\u2019 says Gerwig, springing up from her chair, as the song keeps on blaring until the she can find it. \u2018My ringtone is Enya,\u2019 she says, having eventually silenced the ring tone. \u2018Because phones ringing are anxious. And Enya is wonderful.\u2019\n\nThat Gerwig would try to self-soothe with late-80s Irish synth pop during the most high-pressure moment of her career is understandable. Because it\u2019s safe to say that she has a lot on when we meet, having only recently finished the Barbie movie she has directed and co-written. The pre-release buzz for the film has been extraordinary; every scrap of gossip, every leaked paparazzi photo of its stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, as Barbie and Ken, rollerblading in neon kneepads has been a viral moment. On TikTok, the BarbieTheMovie hashtag has a cool 991.5m views.\n\nLIA CLAY MILLER\n\nGerwig\u2019s involvement has intrigued pop culture geeks from the start: her fans would not have had a Barbie blockbuster on their bingo card. She is known for naturalistic, indie-skewing movies, starring in Greenberg (2010) with Ben Stiller and acting in and co-writing Frances Ha (2012), both of which capitalised on her whimsical, relatable, charisma. She later directed Lady Bird (2017), which was partly inspired by her childhood in Sacramento, California, and a 2019 adaptation of Little Women, both of which were Oscar nominated.\n\nGrowing up, she says, \u2018My mom wasn\u2019t crazy about Barbie. It wasn\u2019t something that felt, necessarily, approved, which made it more intriguing.\u2019 Her family didn\u2019t have a TV, she wasn\u2019t allowed to wear logos: this was not a world of Barbie Dream House-style all-American consumerism. \u2018Part of the reason I think I was so intrigued [by this project],\u2019 she says, \u2018is because, not even intellectually, but from deep inside, I understand the counter-arguments. That feels rich.\u2019\n\nBarbie is literally plastic. She\u2019s unchanging. If you threw her out, she just wouldn't disintegrate. If I could give that persona some humanity, some falling-apart-ness, that - in and of itself - would be be meaningful\n\nShe hopes the film subverts sexist stereotypes. Barbie, she says, is, \u2018literally plastic. She\u2019s unchanging. If you threw her out, she just wouldn't disintegrate. If I could give that persona some humanity, some falling-apart-ness, that \u2013 in and of itself \u2013 would be be meaningful.\u2019 Also, \u2018In this sort of double mirror of the movie, Margot Robbie is also a person we expect to be perfect. What does that mean that we also do that? Is she allowed to fall apart and be vulnerable?\u2019\n\nIt was Robbie, the film's producer, who initially brought Gerwig on board as a writer. Gerwig said she would do it if her partner, Noah Baumbach, came too; she fell in love with the finished script and put herself forward to direct it.\n\n\u2018Even though it's about Barbie, it felt incredibly personal. Just as personal as anything else I've made,\u2019 she says. Plot details are closely guarded, but we do know there are multiple refreshingly diverse Barbies living in a perfect world that Robbie\u2019s Barbie comes to suspect may not be real, when her permanently arched feet fall flat and she worries about dying. (Close ups of Robbie-as-Barbie\u2019s perpetual tip toes went viral earlier this year; those feet, \u2018are like a bat signal,\u2019 says Gerwig).\n\nLIA CLAY MILLER\n\n\u2018It starts off in a place where there is no aging, no death, no shame, no separation. That\u2019s an oldie but a goodie. Because I went to Catholic school, that story of Eve and Adam suddenly realising they are naked really stuck with me,\u2019 she says. She talks about John Milton's Paradise Lost, and the idea that there is no poetry without pain, one of many perhaps unexpected references \u2014 including Vincent Minelli\u2019s An American in Paris, Jacques Tati's Mon Uncle and Powell and Pressburger\u2019s Stairway to Heaven \u2014 she has brought to the project.\n\nIf you're an asshole on a Greta Gerwig set, there's no hope for you\n\nAs a director, Gerwig likes to foster a sense of security on set. 'Like you all step into the same shared dream,' she says. (\u2018If you're an asshole on a Greta Gerwig set, there's no hope for you,\u2019 says the actor Simu Liu, who plays one of the Kens.) Hence the Barbie-themed sleepover before filming, where at least twelve Barbies plus America Ferrera (at the time of writing, Ferrera\u2019s character is yet to be revealed) hung out; the Kens briefly popped over to play parlour games. Gerwig also encouraged the cast to bring their families to set. At one point, Ryan Gosling was chatting with her mum. \u2018She just got right in there. He was like: \u201cYour mom\u2019s amazing.\u201d\u2019\n\nShe feels very much \u2018in the middle everything\u2019 in life, not least because she has just had a second baby (she also has a four-year-old son, Harold, and a stepson, who is 13). She retires to a private room to pump a bottle of breast milk, which is handed to her assistant, between the shoot and the interview. \u2018I\u2019m about to be 40,\u2019 she says. \u2018And there\u2019s something about that where you\u2019re like: Oh! I\u2019m properly middle aged now.\u2019 All parts of life feel extremely activated.\u2019 She shows me a picture of her baby on her lap, at his four-month checkup the previous day. \u2018He\u2019s a little Schmoo. I don\u2019t know if you can tell energy from the picture, but that\u2019s very much his energy. He\u2019s a wise little baby.\u2019\n\nShe is incredibly upbeat and eloquent, which is all the more impressive when I learn that she isn\u2019t sleeping much. \u2018The little guy is sleeping through the night. But I'm still doing that thing where I wake up, every hour to 90 minutes, and just hover. You just keep wanting to look at that baby. So I'm slightly in a twilight state,\u2019 she says. But you would never know she needs a nap as she talks me through her favourite designers (she loves the Rodarte sisters, Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, and she discovered Margaret Howell in London: \u2018That stuff is primo!\u2019) and her fear of department stores (\u2018I get overwhelmed because there's so much glass - too much reflective surface!\u2019)\n\nI don\u2019t want to be 80 and look back and say I could have really done it, from 40 to 60, but I chose to be practical!\n\nOn the Barbie set she wore the same boiler suit, in different colours, every day; she has long been a \u2018uniform-seeker\u2019. Now, she says, as she approaches her forties, \u2018I want to start being more playfully outrageous.\u2019 She talks about how fun it was to wear long nails and high heels for our shoot. \u2018I don\u2019t want to be 80 and look back and say I could have really done it, from 40 to 60, but I chose to be practical! But we will see how far I get with this,\u2019 she says. Either way, it feels as though she is grabbing the current moment with both hands. \u2018I'll probably look back and say, \u201cThat was a really an amazing time. And I don't know how all of it was possible.\u201d But it\u2019s filled with a lot of happiness.\u2019\n\nLIA CLAY MILLER"

Saturday Night Fever obviously has this incredible soundtrack by the Bee Gees. There's a documentary about the Bee Gees, and I'd seen it and was so touched by the Bee Gees, and I thought Barbie seemed so disco to me in her heart, because Barbie's sort of \u2014 and I will say this as a lover of Barbie and disco \u2014 a little bit dorky in the best way. Saturday Night Fever was a movie that was driven by music, but not a musical. I guess we're half of a musical."

That kind of creation myth is the opposite of the creation myth in Genesis.\"\n\nMargot Robbie \u2014 who plays the film's titular character \u2014 also told Vogue in the same interview that Gerwig even wrote \"an abstract poem about Barbie\" that was similar to the Apostles Creed to help set the tone of the film."

If you think \"Barbie\" is simply a mindless plastic doll, the stars who made the movie would ask you to think again.\n\nWe talked with the cast, including Margot \"Barbie\" Robbie and Ryan \"Ken\" Gosling, before SAG-AFTRA strike.\n\n\"I think what was going to be important for this movie, specifically, is that we could honor the legacy of the Barbie brand, but also have a culturally relevant conversation with where we're at today. And everything in between. And I think Greta, as a filmmaker, has a way of honoring the past but also bringing it into a modern day setting,\" Robbie said. \"You hold both of those things at the same time. And I think there's a lot of that in this movie where you're holding two things in the same conversation like we can have this silly, absurd comedy at the same time that you can be making a statement about life. And someone like Greta does that deftly and she makes it not just easy, but delightful.\"\n\n\"I didn't want to mess this up,\" said Gosling. He called what Robbie and Gerwig created \"so fun and perfect and amazing,\" adding, \"I think all of us just felt like a lot of pressure to not be the one to mess it up.\"\n\n\"Barbie\" is rated PG-13.

    "text": "In the early 90s, according to a story that may now have become slightly mythologised in the retelling, the actor Sarah Polley \u2013 then aged 12 \u2013 was asked by Disney executives to remove a peace sign badge she was wearing. When she refused, Disney blacklisted her. This story lost a little of its potency last month with the announcement that Polley was set to direct the new \u201clive-action\u201d reboot of Bambi. For admirers of Polley\u2019s determinedly independent career, the record-scratch noise could not be louder: this is somebody who worked with Atom Egoyan, David Cronenberg and Hal Hartley for God\u2019s sake, before the age of 22.\n\nThoughts of Polley returned this week with the now-deafening noise surrounding the release of Barbie, directed by another former queen of independent cinema, Greta Gerwig. Coming up a few years after Polley, Gerwig was so indie that her films didn\u2019t even go to Sundance, they went to South by Southwest. She was so indie that when she moved from micro-budget mumblecore movies to a scripted film with Noah Baumbach \u2013 Greenberg, in 2010 \u2013 the Guardian called it \u201cher first tentative steps into the mainstream\u201d. Greenberg was made for a budget of $25m, which it didn\u2019t make back; now Gerwig has directed Barbie, for the film arm of mega-corporation Mattel, with a budget of $145m. Gerwig\u2019s swerve into the actual mainstream prompts the question: does the phrase \u201cselling out\u201d have any meaning any more?\n\nGerwig and Polley are far from the only directors to have moved in this direction of late: Barry Jenkins, for instance, has now finished work on The Lion King sequel for Disney. Jenkins\u2019s first feature film, Medicine for Melancholy, premiered at South by Southwest in 2008, the same year Greta Gerwig presented her directorial debut there \u2013 Nights and Weekends, co-directed with Joe Swanberg. (Incidentally, it\u2019s interesting that so many articles now omit to credit that tiny, little-seen film as Gerwig\u2019s first movie, preferring instead to reset her directorial career with the Oscar-nominated Lady Bird nearly 10 years later.) When Jenkins\u2019 Moonlight won the Oscar for best picture in 2017, ABC News called it \u201cthe little film that could\u201d; IndieWire asked \u201chow a $1.5m indie landed eight Oscar nominations\u201d. But did Moonlight triumph over the industry, or was it in fact the other way round?\n\nMattel and Disney are two enormous corporations that would seem to stand for everything these directors are \u2013 or should be \u2013 in opposition to. To anyone observing the state of cinema in 2023, it should be a point of utmost clarity that the might of these megabucks companies can do nothing but crush the smaller people. A recent article about Barbie in the New Yorker quoted no less a figure than Gerwig\u2019s own agent as saying: \u201cIs it a great thing that our great creative actors and film-makers live in a world where you can only take giant swings around consumer content and mass-produced products? I don\u2019t know. But it is the business.\u201d You don\u2019t say.\n\nWhy has the concept of selling out lost so much of its cultural capital today? Online, you can hardly move for defenders of these directors, belligerently vaunting the fact that \u2013 for instance \u2013 Gerwig was influenced by directors such as Max Oph\u00fcls and Jacques Tati, as if that confers greater legitimacy on a film using IP (intellectual property) to make money for a toy company that sells vacuous, hypersexualised dolls. There\u2019s a parallel here: the idea of Barbie dolls being in any way noxious seems, in the current climate, to be as hopelessly stick-in-the-mud a stance as the concept of selling out. The thought appears to be: look, the bad guys won, so we should all go along with it; since we\u2019re all hypersexualised anyway, we might as well do it in a more egalitarian fashion; since the big corporations rule everything now, we might as well get people with a bit of artistic nous to be the face of their product.\n\nBut the recent writer and actor strikes in the US show that selling out is not just a question of personal ethics, but an industry-wide concern. A director\u2019s decision to align themselves with these Goliaths of entertainment has consequences; makes money for the big guy, in opposition to fostering an industry where smaller films and creators have more opportunities. The activist and screenwriter of Don\u2019t Look Up, David Sirota recently commented: \u201cQuick reminder that literally not a single human being would pay any money to watch a movie/TV show written and acted by Bob Iger [the billionaire CEO of Disney] which means the resources that pay his entire zillion dollar salary are generated by writers and actors, not by him.\u201d This is certainly true. For his part, former indie darling Mark Ruffalo, now known for being the Incredible Hulk, tweeted: \u201cHow about we all jump into indies now?\u201d: this is in reference to the fact that certain independent films are exceptionally permitted to continue shooting by the striking union, Sag-Aftra. But the thing is, Ruffalo et al always could have made indies. That\u2019s where he started out, after all, in films for directors such as Kenneth Lonergan \u2013 and where many of his colleagues still ply their trade; instead, his recent filmography has generated billions for Disney, via Marvel. Of course creators must seize what opportunities they can to create, within an increasingly compromised industry, but personal responsibility still exists; the actions of individuals have a knock-on effect.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Film Weekly Free newsletter Take a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mattel is planning films based on Barney the Dinosaur, He-Man and Polly Pocket \u2013 words to turn a film journalist\u2019s hopes to ash \u2013 and alongside the new Bambi and Lion King films Disney has a plethora of walking-dead reboots of its old IP lined up, including a remake of The Aristocats by Questlove, the director of the independent documentary Summer of Soul. Barbie will most likely be as good and creative a film as it can be under the circumstances; odds-on that it will have the temerity to lightly poke fun at the doll and its billionaire patrons. But in the meantime, in a changing world for cinema, the struggle for the soul of cinema goes on."

It was something where I decided I had to direct it once the script was written and it was really like I just wanted to make that one, that was the one. So I was like if we can\u2019t do it that\u2019s fine, but I hope they let us.\u201d\n\n#Barbie Director Greta Gerwig tells The Hollywood Reporter she always thought of Barbie's arched foot as a \"bat signal\" at the #BarbieMovie World Premiere pic.twitter.com/tizaBczQJ1 \u2014 The Hollywood Reporter (@THR) July 10, 2023\n\nABOUT 'BARBIE'\n\nMargot Robbie and Ryan Gosling will be seen in lead roles as Barbie and Ken now.

    "text": "No one predicted that Greta Gerwig would be the next filmmaker to bring C.S. Lewis\u2019s Narnia to the screen. This week, however, it was revealed that the indie film darling is indeed currently on track to write and direct two film adaptations for Netflix. Production and release dates have not been set.\n\nWhile we wait to hear from her directly, this profile gives a brief overview of her career \u2013 highlighting notable quotes and connections that readers of the beloved Narnia books may find interesting.\n\n\u201cMumblecore\u201d\n\nNights and Weekends (2008)\n\nGerwig first gained notoriety directing, writing, and appearing in several low-budget \u201cmumblecore\u201d films. She earned a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in Frances Ha (2012), which she co-wrote with director Noah Baumbach. To date, Gerwig and Baumbach have collaborated on four projects together.\n\nOscar Buzz\n\nLady Bird (2017)\n\nGerwig\u2019s solo directorial debut, Lady Bird, received widespread critical acclaim. She earned Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay.\n\nThe film\u2019s Sacramento Catholic high school setting mirrors Gerwig\u2019s personal experience:\n\n\u201cIn high school, we took four years of theology, and \u2018grace\u2019 was explained to me as being \u2018completely unexpected, holy, and deserved, but is something that can never be earned\u2019 [\u2026] and there\u2019s something deeply beautiful about that to me. Religion News\n\n\u201cI have always been moved by the story of the denial of Peter. [\u2026] He is given the opportunity to repent through love. These stories have always informed my writing and my ideas, finding a larger universal truth behind what are so-called \u2018small\u2019 lives. Lady Bird denies where she is from, yes, but in the end, she also declares her love. We are granted the opportunity for grace, and we need love to accept it. Angelus News\n\nI always have some religious story threaded underneath that people can pick up on or not pick up on. I don\u2019t need them to, but it helps me as an organizing principle because even if you don\u2019t believe in the stories, they are very old stories, and they do speak really deeply to people and their psychologies and how they deal with life. The Washington Post\n\nNew Take on a Classic\n\nLittle Women (2019)\n\nNext Gerwig moved onto a more mainstream project, co-writing and directing another film adaptation of Louisa May Alcott\u2019s classic novel Little Women. The film received six Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nI hadn\u2019t read it since I was 14 or 15, and then I happened to read it when I was 30, just because I thought I would re-love it. My experience with the book completely changed. First of all, there were things in the book that I hadn\u2019t remembered at all. And there were things that seemed much spikier and stranger and more modern and very relevant\u2026 I said, \u201cOh, I\u2019d like to make a film with this, because now I see this completely differently, and I think there\u2019s something interesting here that is completely pressing to make a film about. Deadline\n\nGoing Big (and Pink)\n\nBarbie (2023)\n\nWith a budget of $100 million, Gerwig\u2019s latest project is a far cry from her indie roots.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been part of anything like [Barbie]. But in a funny way, it feels like the fundamentals are the same. Even though it is Barbie and it is an internationally known brand, the movie feels very personal. It feels just as intimate as Lady Bird or Little Women.\u201d Rolling Stone\n\nRegarding the film\u2019s vibrant color palette:\n\nI never wanted my adult taste to override what I loved as a kid. When I was eight years old, I loved the biggest, brightest, loudest, sparkliest thing that I could find. And I need to honor that even though I want the movie to be beautiful and delicious. I don\u2019t want it to be overwhelmed with adult good taste, because that just feels disingenuous to what the task is. Rolling Stone\n\nNarnia\n\nAnd now\u2026 Greta Gerwig is preparing to be a temporary custodian of stories that mean so much to people around the world. C.S. Lewis\u2019s Chronicles of Narnia have been translated into 47 languages.\n\nThere\u2019s some movies I\u2019d like to make that require a big canvas. I\u2019ve seen so many directors move between bigger movies and smaller movies. [\u2026] I want to play in lots of different worlds. That\u2019s the goal. Rolling Stone\n\nOh, by the way, she can use a sword\u2026\n\nThe NarniaWeb team wholeheartedly wishes Greta all the best on this new journey!\n\nHere is everything we know about Netflix\u2019s Narnia.\n\nNow that you know a little more about Greta Gerwig, how do you feel about her adapting Narnia for Netflix?

    "text": "When Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird, Little Women) set out to direct Barbie \u2014 and write the screenplay with her partner, Noah Baumbach \u2014 she knew that LGBTQ+ inclusion would be a necessity. While actors Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling give life to the OG Barbie and Ken dolls, the film\u2019s Barbieland is filled with Barbies and Kens that reflect the vibrant diversity of the real world \u2014 albeit a more colorful version with Dreamhouses, daily beach parties, and bops from divas like Lizzo, Dua Lipa, Nicki Minaj, Charli XCX, and Ava Max.\n\n\u201cWe are opening the doors to the Barbie universe,\u201d Gerwig states in an email interview. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we could have told this story without bringing in the LGBTQ+ community, and it was important for us to represent the diversity that Mattel has created with all of the different Barbies and Kens that exist today.\u201d\n\nALEX in RAISA VANESSA Dress DAVID YURMAN, MISHO Rings CUYANA Earrings; SCOTT in GUCCI Jacket DIOR Shirt GUCCI Scarf SIEDRES Pants LOUBOUTIN Shoes; HARI in RODARTE Dress DAVID YURMAN Ring STUART WEITZMAN Shoes\n\nOut\u2019s cover stars (and Barbieland residents), Hari Nef, Scott Evans, and Alexandra Shipp, all attest to the impact of the Mattel toy brand, which first launched in 1959 and has since grown into the most popular doll in the world. For many queer people, first encountering Barbie \u2014 her interchangeable accessories, her exaggerated femininity, her hunky boyfriend, Ken \u2014 would become a pivotal moment in their young lives. Barbie was a friend, a possibility, a glamorous vessel of pure fabulosity.\n\nOf course, Barbie also has a problematic past. The prototype\u2019s blond hair, blue eyes, and surreally thin physique are emblematic of the unrealistic beauty standards society imposes on women. But Gerwig knew that the doll was far more than pretty plastic. And she wanted to capture that complexity in her Warner Bros. feature film.\n\n\u201cSince Barbie has had a long history, we had to confront the criticisms head on,\u201d Gerwig says. \u201cWe needed to get there before anyone else. Barbie has been equal parts painted a villain and a heroine. We point out and engage with the critics, and at the same time, we celebrate Barbie. She was the first adult doll people could play with. Barbie went to the moon before women could have credit cards. Barbie represents a lot of different things, but in a way, she was a stealthy advocate for women in the workplace and our achievements in society. There are definitely complications with Barbie, but it\u2019s undeniable that she was at the vanguard of moving other things forward.\u201d\n\nHARI NEF, ALEXANDRA SHIPP, SHARON ROONEY, ANA CRUZKAYNE, and EMMA MACKEY as Barbies in Warner Bros. Pictures\u2019 \"BARBIE\"\n\nThe Oscar-nominated director, now 39, also felt a connection to Barbie from a young age \u2014 though she didn\u2019t have the easiest time attaining one. \u201cMy mom wasn\u2019t sold on Barbie, so I actually didn\u2019t get my own doll for a while,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut all the girls in my neighborhood had them, so I was able to play with them when I would go over to their houses, and then when they would get tired of them, I would get them as hand-me-downs. But I have a real sense memory of standing in Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us looking at Barbie dolls and loving the ones that were in the big boxes. The ones with the big hair. It\u2019s a very vivid, visceral memory of Barbie and what she meant. Finally, one Christmas, my mom caved and got me one. I was so excited.\u201d\n\nAnother woman would bring an adult Gerwig back into Barbieland: her star, Margot Robbie (Bombshell, Birds of Prey), who is also a producer of the film. Robbie \u201cinvited me on this journey,\u201d Gerwig recalls. \u201cI love her work as an actor, and when we met and talked, I was deeply impressed by her work and viewpoint as a producer. I thought that I would love to make something with her. When she approached me and Noah to write Barbie, I jumped at the chance. Barbie is something everyone knows, all around the world, and everyone has an opinion of her. I couldn\u2019t imagine a richer subject to try and tackle than something that comes with so much feeling already.\u201d\n\nExperience the Barbie feeling more in the profiles of Nef, Evans, and Shipp. And don\u2019t miss the Barbie movie, which comes out in theaters July 21.\n\nThis cover story is part of the Out July/August issue, out on newsstands July 4.

The actor has revealed how she was \"a real rule follower\" at school and \"had a ton of energy\". She talks about her mother, who wanted to sign her up for every activity.\"But as a kid, my mum was like, \u2018Let\u2019s sign her up for every activity.Let\u2019s tire her out.\u2019 I\u2019ve always had a tremendous amount of enthusiasm. I was just interested in, like, everything. I had a really active imagination. I had a lot of really deep feelings. I was emotional,\" she told the media outlet.ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood. Kids with ADHD often have trouble focusing, and paying attention and have impulsive behaviors. As the symptoms advance, these kids find it difficult to cope at school and with friends.More than 350 million people globally have ADHD. The symptoms show up differently in different people making it difficult to identify the symptoms and get them diagnosed and treated. The signs of ADHD get overlooked easily.There are three types of ADHD: Predominantly Inattentive Presentation in which the individual forgets basic things and gets distracted easily, Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation in which it is difficult for the person to remain silent and sit still, Combined Presentation in which the individual shows both the types of symptoms.The US CDC lists the following as the common symptoms of ADHD: daydreaming, forgetting or losing things a lot, squirming or fidgeting, talking too much, making careless mistakes or taking unnecessary risks, having a hard time resisting temptation, having trouble taking turns and having difficulty getting along with others.There are several factors that increase an individual's risk for developing ADHD. While studies link genetic factors, other factors like brain injury, premature delivery and low birth weight increase the risk for this disorder. Exposure to lead and other environmental toxin and/ or consumption of alcohol and tobacco during pregnancy also increases the risk of the child developing ADHD."

    "text": "The Barbie movie is just around the corner, and moviegoers are eager to see Margot Robbie take on the role of Barbie and Ryan Gosling the role of Ken. The film was helmed by Lady Bird and Little Women director, Greta Gerwig, who cast a star-studded line-up of actors to play alongside Robbie and Gosling. Recently, Gerwig had a chat with The Guardian about Barbie, and she revealed she didn't initially tell her partner Noah Baumbach that she signed him up to be the movie's co-writer. During the interview, Gerwig also talked about organizing a sleepover with the cast before filming began.\n\nGerwig revealed that she planned a slumber party with Robbie, Issa Rae, and America Ferrera at Claridges, the London hotel. Together, they wore pajamas and played games. Some of the Ken actors were also invited but didn't spend the night. \"Honestly, it just felt like it would be the most fun way to kick everything off,\" Gerwig explained. \"And it's something you don't get to do that much as an adult. Like, 'I'm just going to go have a sleepover with my friends\u2026'\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Gerwig has arranged something special for her actors. Before making Little Women, she had the four main cast members memorize poems and read them to each other. \"These were professional actors,\" Gerwig explained, \"But there was something about the fact they had to select a poem and then recite it... It was very intimate and amazing, and they were very vulnerable. It instantly felt helpful in creating that connection.\" She added, \"As a director, you have the job of dreaming up the movie, and then you have to get everyone else in the movie \u2013 hundreds of people \u2013 to have that same dream, too.\"\n\nWhat Is Barbie About?\n\nIn Barbie, to live in Barbie Land is to be a perfect being in a perfect place. Unless you have a full-on existential crisis. Or you're a Ken. From Oscar-nominated writer/director Greta Gerwig comes Barbie, which hits theaters on July 21st. Barbie stars Oscar-nominees Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Barbie and Ken, alongside America Ferrera, Kate McKinnon, Michael Cera, Ariana Greenblatt, Issa Rae, Rhea Perlman, and Will Ferrell. The film also stars Ana Cruz Kayne, Emma Mackey, Hari Nef, Alexandra Shipp, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Simu Liu, Ncuti Gatwa, Scott Evans, Jamie Demetriou, Connor Swindells, Sharon Rooney, Nicola Coughlan, Ritu Arya, Grammy Award-winning singer/songwriter Dua Lipa and Oscar-winner Helen Mirren. Gerwig directed Barbie from a screenplay by Gerwig & Oscar nominee Noah Baumbach, based on Barbie by Mattel."

But apparently, co-star Ryan Gosling\u2014who plays Ken\u2014took a bit more convincing to join the project.\n\nTalking to Rolling Stone, Barbie director and co-writer Greta Gerwig explains that Gosling was her only choice for Ken, even though she\u2019d never actually met him . \u201cIt was only ever Ryan Gosling, and it was a long journey. Margot and I just wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer,\u201d Gerwig said. \u201c From the moment that Margot came to me and I knew we were making this for Margot, I equally knew we were making this for Ryan. And I did not know Ryan at all. I\u2019d never met him. I just was sure, and as soon as I thought of it, it made me so happy. Who else could do this? It\u2019s some combination of Marlon Brando meets Gene Wilder meets John Barrymore meets John Travolta.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGerwig calls Gosling \u201ca secretly comedic actor\u201d who succeeds by taking comedy very, very seriously. \u201cT he way we talked about Ken was as in-depth character work as I\u2019ve ever done with anyone about anything ... I don\u2019t know that anyone has ever invested more in making people understand the plight of this man. It was extraordinary,\u201d Gerwig said. \u201c I felt with both of them that I might direct movies for a long time and never see anything that uniquely and gloriously unhinged.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHead to Rolling Stone to read the full interview, which also includes the tidbit that Gerwig is absolutely open to making a superhero movie\u2014 \u201c It would have to be something I had a feeling for and a relationship to\u201d\u2014even though she agrees Barbie is already sort of a superhero movie: \u201c It\u2019s iconic in the same way.

    "text": "Just over two weeks until its July 21 release, the fanfare shows no signs of slowing down. For those perplexed by all the excitement over a movie about a toy \u2014 even one that has spanned several generations \u2014 look no further.\n\nFor months, the hype surrounding Greta Gerwig\u2019s live-action Barbie film has been building, thanks to a zealous marketing push, its popular director and star-studded cast, and a nonstop stream of memes.\n\nHere\u2019s a guide to all the online buzz over the Barbie movie.\n\nThe memes: From \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 jokes to Gerwig stanning\n\nAlmost immediately after the trailer and cast posters dropped, the Internet pounced on the meme-making opportunity, helping to boost its status early on. The \u201cThis Barbie/Ken\u201d posters promoting the celebrity-packed cast \u2014 and the many professions or achievements of Barbie \u2014 served as the initial templates. (The movie stars Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken.)\n\nGet The Big To-Do Your guide to staying entertained, from live shows and outdoor fun to the newest in museums, movies, TV, books, dining, and more. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nThe movie\u2019s social media team created a Barbie Selfie Generator that online jokesters, corporations including Dunkin\u2019, and even agencies like the MBTA made use of. The messaging on the colorful movie poster \u2014 \u201cShe\u2019s everything. He\u2019s just Ken.\u201d \u2014 also inspired a number of cultural references, among them movies like \u201cLittle Women\u201d (also directed by Gerwig) and real-life couples, including Princess Diana and then-Prince Charles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the apparent campiness of the film has offered fertile ground for memes, perhaps the most popular have involved Barbie vs. Oppenheimer, an Internet phenomenon called \u201cBarbenheimer.\u201d Wildly different in tone and premise, the two movies are both opening on July 21, and many either are planning to see both (on the same day) or are fiercely loyal to just one. Either way, the crossover event has generated an endless supply of jokes, from how to schedule the day to merchandise. Even Gerwig and Robbie are on board.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother meme making the rounds touches on Gerwig\u2019s nuanced depiction of girlhood and womanhood seen in her other works, such as \u201cLady Bird.\u201d\n\nA cast and soundtrack overloaded with star power\n\nThe Barbie movie features so many well-known actors, comedians, and musicians, it\u2019s easy to lose track of them in the pinkness of it all. Among those starring in the film include Robbie, Gosling, Simu Liu, Dua Lipa, Emma Mackey, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, Nicola Coughlan, Will Ferrell, America Ferrera, and Michael Cera (Helen Mirren serves as the narrator).\n\nThe soundtrack has an equally talented musical lineup \u2014 including Charli XCX, Nicki Minaj, and Haim \u2014 that has been teased for months. More \u201cBarbies and Kens\u201d (a.k.a. artists) are still to be announced, and the album will be released on vinyl.\n\nA finely curated soundtrack is one of the most important tools in Gerwig\u2019s arsenal, with many of the scenes having specific musical cues, Rolling Stone reported. Robbie told the publication that the lyrics are \u201cresponding to what\u2019s happening on-screen, so the music became ... a device to enhance what the audience was watching and experiencing.\u201d\n\nRyan Gosling and Margot Robbie going all in on Barbie and Ken\n\nSome had doubts about Gosling as Ken, calling him \u201ctoo old\u201d at 42 to play the character (his defenders came out in full force). Gosling good-naturedly poked fun at the debate in an interview with GQ, calling it \u201cfunny \u2014 this kind of clutching-your-pearls idea of, like, #notmyken. Like you ever thought about Ken before this?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you ever really cared about Ken, you would know that nobody cared about Ken. So your hypocrisy is exposed. This is why his story must be told,\u201d he joked.\n\nSince then, Gosling has seemingly won over the naysayers, with the actor fully embracing his \u201cKen-ergy\u201d \u2014 he said Robbie and Gerwig \u201cconjured this out of me somehow\u201d \u2014 and encouraging others to do the same. The first movie clip released Monday, which shows Ken saying his job \u201cis just beach,\u201d also earned Gosling high praise for his comedic skills.\n\nRobbie, meanwhile, told Vogue that she was never a Barbie fan as a child and never imagined herself playing Barbie. But many have been unable to imagine anyone else playing the role, and Robbie has leaned into the character and its charms offscreen. Online, much attention has been given to her press tour outfits, designed after models of the toy including \u201cDay to Night Barbie\u201d and \u201cPink and Fabulous Barbie.\u201d\n\nThe can\u2019t-turn-your-eyes-away pinkness of it all\n\nThere\u2019s a color called \u201cBarbie Pink\u201d for a reason. What would a Barbie movie be without Barbie Land and all of its bubbly Barbies and Kens awash in her signature color?\n\nFortunately, Rolling Stone has declared it \u201cthe pinkest movie ever.\u201d\n\nThe color is bright, fun, and iconic \u2014 and Gerwig was keen on bringing her vision in all of its pink glory to life, telling Architectural Digest that she wanted \u201cthe pinks to be very bright, and everything to be almost too much.\u201d Every aspect of the set is infused with the color. Sarah Greenwood, the production designer for the film, told the publication that construction caused an international shortage of the fluorescent shade of Rosco paint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven \u201cBarbiecore,\u201d the viral aesthetic trend inspired by the world of Barbie, is having a moment. Social media is abuzz with jokes and adoration for the color, with some planning on wearing all-pink outfits to see the movie.\n\nA robust press tour and marketing push capitalized on by brands\n\nThe driving force behind all of the hype surrounding the movie has undoubtedly been its aggressive, creative marketing campaign.\n\nThe publicity push is being credited with transforming a toy (and brand) that had lost its luster into something cool and trendy again.\n\nBy playing up Barbie\u2019s nostalgia power and making much of the campaign interactive \u2014 from an immersive \u201cWorld of Barbie\u201d experience in Los Angeles, to the Barbie Boat Cruise in Boston and the Airbnb listing called \u201cBarbie\u2019s Malibu DreamHouse - Ken\u2019s Way!\u201d \u2014 fans have been able to take part in the fun. As brand strategist Moshe Isaacian explained in a lengthy Twitter thread, a number of brands have also partnered with the film, from Xbox to ALDO Shoes to Cold Stone Creamery and more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to Barbie marketing I am but a pink cog in the capitalist machine,\u201d a Twitter commenter quipped.\n\nThe enthusiasm generated by the marketing campaign has been boosted by the attention that the worldwide press tour is receiving. From Sydney to Seoul, the cast has met with fans, dressed for the occasion (especially Robbie), and brought Barbie Land with them.

    "text": "The following article contains spoilers for Barbie.\n\nFor some, Barbie is the ultimate \u201cgirlboss\u201d \u2013 she\u2019s glamourous, successful and owns her own DreamHouse. For others, Barbie represents an outdated female stereotype \u2013 a \u201cblonde bimbo girl in a fantasy world\u201d, according to Aqua\u2019s 1997 hit song Barbie Girl.\n\nJust ask the man with the megaphone stood outside the press screening of the new Barbie film that I attended in Leicester Square. Vehemently protesting the film, he insisted that Barbie is a bad role model and a danger to young women.\n\nBut Barbie fits perfectly into director Greta Gerwig\u2019s repertoire of women-focused stories, which includes two Oscar-nominated coming of age films, Ladybird (2017) and Little Women (2019). Gerwig is a feminist filmmaker whose characters are curious, transgressive and rebel against their restrictive circumstances. Barbie is no exception.\n\nThe film follows Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie), whose perfect life in Barbieland is gradually falling apart because the humans playing with her in the real world are sad. Her arched Barbie feet become flat, she gets cellulite on her thighs and becomes troubled by thoughts of death.\n\nWith the help of Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) \u2013 comically styled as if a child \u201cplayed with her too hard\u201d \u2013 Stereotypical Barbie is tasked with entering the real world to find her human family and solve their problems.\n\nThe film opens with a parody of a famous scene from Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). The world is thrown into disarray when a giant Barbie doll lands in the desert like a UFO. Through Helen Mirren\u2019s terrific narration, we are told that the inhabitants of this barren wasteland are a hoard of little girls who only have baby dolls to play with. The girls are liberated by the arrival of their exciting new friend and, tired of playing at being mothers, they smash up their bland baby dolls for good.\n\nThis opening positions Barbieland as a feminist utopia. In Barbieland, women can do anything: become president, win literary awards and throw fabulous parties.\n\nBarbie in the real world\n\nGerwig\u2019s take on Barbie is timely. My research explores the recent feminist reclamation of the \u201cbimbo\u201d figure. On TikTok, the #Bimbo trend sees feminine-presenting content creators reclaiming the once derogatory \u201cbimbo\u201d label and aesthetic. Instead of abandoning femininity to succeed in a patriarchal society, bimbo feminism embraces femininity while supporting women\u2019s advancement.\n\nIn the real world, Barbie is shocked to find that things are a little different than in Barbieland. She is harassed while roller skating and catcalled by male construction workers. A 2021 survey found that four-fifths of young women in the UK have been sexually harassed in public spaces. While Barbie says she feels \u201cill at ease\u201d in these situations, Ken (Ryan Gosling) feels \u201cadmired\u201d.\n\nWhen Barbie finds her human family, she is met with hostility from teenage daughter Sasha, who claims that Barbie is nothing more than a \u201cprofessional bimbo\u201d whose perfect body and privileged lifestyle have been making women feel bad about themselves for decades.\n\nLike real women, Barbie is faced with objectification and criticism. The film knows its audience and makes smart and accurate commentaries about women\u2019s experiences.\n\nKen\u2019s rights\n\nIn Barbieland, Barbie\u2019s beach-dwelling boyfriend is \u201cjust Ken\u201d. In the real world, he discovers a society where men reign supreme. It is not long before Ken\u2019s endearing innocence is tainted by a concept that is novel where he comes from: patriarchy.\n\nKen becomes intoxicated by male dominance and the film takes every opportunity to lampoon it. Ryan Gosling excels in these comedy moments. At one point, Ken barges into a hospital and demands to perform surgery despite having no qualifications \u2013 other than being a man of course.\n\nBack in Barbieland, Ken enforces his own vision of patriarchy. Every night is \u201cboys night\u201d. Every Barbie exists to be ogled, serve beers and nurture men\u2019s fragile egos. Under Ken\u2019s rule, the former female president of Barbieland serves drinks to macho guys on the beach. The all-female Supreme Court are demoted to a cheerleading squad.\n\nIn her 2020 book Men Who Hate Women, founder of the Everyday Sexism project Laura Bates examines what she terms the \u201cmanosphere\u201d. In other words, the many faces of radical misogyny in modern society, from men\u2019s rights activists to incels.\n\nIn its portrayal of the Kens, Gerwig\u2019s film confronts the manosphere head on. Much like the men who are indoctrinated into these radical groups, the Kens are led to believe that their rights are being eclipsed by women\u2019s and find themselves conforming to toxic male stereotypes to regain a sense of control.\n\nGerwig\u2019s Barbie does a stellar job of exposing how damaging patriarchal ideology is to society. While the film obviously appeals to women, it is men who really need to watch it. Barbie makes a point that Leicester Square-megaphone-man really needs to hear: it\u2019s not a Barbie doll that threatens women\u2019s rights, opportunities and safety \u2013 it\u2019s the patriarchy.\n\nBarbie is one of the most surprising and daring films of the year. What could have been a frivolous flop succeeds in being a substantial, important and poignant piece of filmmaking \u2013 as well as tremendous fun to watch.\n\nLooking for something good?

    "text": "The set designers made everything look like the toys have been blown up to a human scale. It's as if my childhood playroom was brought to life with all the giant pink Dreamhouses arranged in a cul-de-sac. They have no walls so that the Barbies can wave to each other. Many of the hand-made objects look plastic, like the toothbrushes with the squiggles of toothpaste resting on top. Inside, the Dreamhouse has modernist furniture from the 1950s and 1960s, referencing the time of Barbie's inception.\n\nOne of the best parts of the whimsical design is the fridge. Some of the plastic containers, like the containers of food and milk, are real but the back is just a decal \u2014 hand-painted images of delicious cookie dough or soda cans. Margot Robbie praised the film's playful visual style:\n\n\"It is intentionally 2D ... we want things to be obviously artificial but still very satisfying ... Even though it's fake, it's really beautiful, which is kind of like everything in Barbieland.\"\n\nBarbie's pool is also fake, just like the sticker on your Dreamhouse toy that created the illusion of water. There are no water or fire elements in Barbieland, so she doesn't actually shower, either. As Barbie, Margot Robbie will slide down and gently step onto her pool. She said that the crew often walked around the shiny blue water because it seems so real.\n\nBarbie also has a gorgeous mailbox shaped like a flamingo. Inside, the letters are gibberish, reflecting the writing of children. Such small details indicate how much thought and care Gerwig put into this film. Each shot is a confectionary visual delight, and there is so much to see."

    "text": "Barbie is one of the most awaited films of the year. The Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie starrer movie has created a lot of buzz even before its release. The first reaction was out a few days ago and people are definitely loving the film, which has garnered attention for its unique setup as well as the number of Barbies and Kens. As the anticipation grows, we got a chance to sit down with Ken aka Simu Liu, and set decorator Katie Spencer for a chat. During the interaction, we got to know a lot about what went on behind the scene as well as how beautifully the movie was shot.\n\nSimu Liu talks about his character as well as director Greta Gerwig\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Pinkvilla, Simu Liu shared the insights of playing the role of Ken and how he came about it.\n\nI mean, just really, really incredible. I mean, Greta is someone that I've admired for so long. She's one of those like just really smart, unique filmmakers. And hearing that she was gonna do a project like Barbie, I think it made a lot of people really, really excited about it. And you know, that, that's before I even met her, by the way. And actually getting to be on set with her and work with her, um, It's just incredible. She's so collaborative. I think the most important thing for actors is that they feel like they're heard and, they feel like it's a safe space to try things and to throw ideas out. And Greta's so good at just kind of creating that space and, there's a, a patience and a kindness with her that. And, it's just so special to be able to, you know, go through that process and that journey with her and Margot. By the way, it's such an exceptional, you know, she's not just an actress, but the producer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYeah, that's a really good question. Cause Shang doesn't really dress that well. Yeah. Let's be, let's be honest. Yeah. His sense of fashion is, is a little bit lacking. I think he would look at Ken and be like, wow, that guy dresses really well. He'd be like, first of all, that guy dresses really well. Second, his hair is always so perfect. Yeah. And third, why does he kind of look like me? I think those would be the three things going through. It's not fine.\n\nYou know granted it was very deliberate in the way that Greta showed Barbie land. I think Barbie land needed to feel like it was a place for everyone from the cast to the other dancers. Everybody inhabiting that world. Um, it's, it's meant to be inclusive and it's meant to be, meant to show the world for, for what it is.\n\nI think yeah, unsurprising that, you know, when you look at our cast of Barbies and Kens that, we're definitely reflective of that. I think it's a big, you know, it's big, it speaks very well of a company like Mattel. Also especially in the last few years, really pivoting from this very kind of Eurocentric, white-centric version of what Barbie is. This very narrow definition to like really opening up what Barbie means and what Barbie can look like, you know, and yeah, I guess what Ken can look like too.\n\nIt's so funny that you mentioned, well, I mean, first of all, I have to, I have to say like, RRR this year was so phenomenal. Um, it was absolutely incredible. And, it blew me away. There are a lot of similarities between I think Barbie and Bollywood.\n\nThere's, you know, just the focus on musicality. There's such music, songs like singing and dancing, like, you know, the actors are, are performing and they're singing and there have to be such triple threats and yeah, I feel like, um, you know, I feel like it's such a natural thing for an actor to look at Bollywood and to want to, you know, want to kind of participate and want to be a part of it in some way.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm putting it out there. I want to be in a Bollywood movie. I wanna be part of a b a Bollywood dance number. Um, So I really wanna make it happen.\n\n\n\nALSO READ: Barbie: Why is Margot Robbie starrer getting banned in Vietnam? Details inside\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarbie set decorator Katie Spencer spills the beans on behind the scenes\n\nIt always starts with the script. And obviously, Greta and Noah wrote this incredible script. It's just, You're on a journey you can't imagine. But it was always more about the script than anything else. Greta is so passionate when she talks about things and also cuz she's an actress, you know, she acts things out. So you feel like you are there.\n\nI never had a Barbie when I was growing up. I never had one right? In the UK we had something called Cindy, but we can't talk about that. But, so I never had a Barbie. So what we did, we bought, um, a Barbie dreamhouse from Amazon to have a look at it. Cause everybody knows what the Barbie doll is like, but the Dreamhouse is a little bit something. And looking at that was an amazing breakthrough cuz you look at it and see how children play with dolls. You know, things like that. There are no walls in the house, you know, there are no stairs. You could just float through and do whatever you like. It was about, the scale of items, within that space.\n\nSome things were out of scale, like the hairbrush. But of course, Margot is human size. It's not Lord of the Ring, so we're not shrinking her or doing anything like that. So everything can be made like the car or anything like the choices we made were quite small. Because Barbie lives in a world approximately 23% smaller than the one we live in. And then of course you bring in the color pink. Yeah. And that's a whole different story.\n\nIt was a very abrasive thing and what we like to do, Sarah (production designer) and I, we do like a show and tell, which is we have this big sort of prop store and everything. And we did a show and tell for Barbie and for Ken and they came down because the more that you can involve the actors, the more the better, whatever film you are doing because their environment is so important. So, yes, every step of the way, we said, what about, you happy with this? From Greta, Sarah, and me, Rodrigo, Jacqueline, Ivan, and the actors, everybody had to be on the same page to make this peculiar world work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's interesting having been on this sort of Barbie boot camp right, and getting to know all the Barbies. Let's have one Barbie as a writer. One Barbie is a painter. You know something aspirational and something enjoyable. So thinking of those characters and thinking how to say it, because like in Barbie land, there's no water, right? There's no paper, there's no electricity. So when you get to see, you'll see that all the newspapers and all the books are solid like a toy. You know, there's no proper writing about it. A bit of a toy. Just writing is just a squiggle. So there were huge challenges there. Yeah. And then how they would interact and then with Greta's script. So yeah, I would think this is probably the most challenging film we've ever done.\n\nI would like for the audience to come out visually. There are lots of other things I could tell you, but if I was to take, um, one, it is the power of color. I think the message is, I think go with your expectations. Open it. Think you're going to see this and you are okay. And then hopefully you'll go, God, that was it. But you will have the best time in the cinema.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout Barbie\n\nBarbie, directed by Greta Gerwig is all set to release on July 21, 2023. The movie stars Ryan Gosling, Margot Robbie, Simu Liu, Alexandra Shipp, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Hari Nef, Scot Evans, Kate McKinnon, Sharon Rooney, Dua Lipa, Nicola Coughlan, Ana Cruz Kayne, Issa Rae, and more.\n\nALSO READ: Margot Robbie channelises her inner Barbie at press tour; Dresses up like vintage dolls"

Vietnamese politicians claim the map violates its sovereignty.\n\nVi Kien Thanh, director general of the Vietnam Cinema Department under the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism, announced that \u201cBarbie\u201d will not be allowed to commercially screen in the nation, as decided by the National Film Evaluation Council.\n\n\u201cWe do not grant license for the American movie \u2018Barbie\u2019 to release in Vietnam because it contains the offending image of the nine-dash line,\u201d the state-run Tuoi Tre newspaper stated, citing Thanh (via Variety).\n\nPrevious films \u201cUncharted\u201d and \u201cAbominable\u201d were similarly banned in Vietnam for the same cause, as well as series \u201cMadam Secretary,\u201d \u201cPine Gap,\u201d and \u201cPut Your Head On My Shoulder.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations ruled unanimously against the validity of the \u201cnine dash line\u201d map in 2016, but China has stated it does not recognize the U.N.\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cBarbie\u201d lead star and producer Margot Robbie previously shared that upon first reading director Gerwig\u2019s script for the live-action Mattel film, she was shocked it could even get made.\n\n\u201cThe first time I read the \u2018Barbie\u2019 script, my reaction was, \u2018Ah! This is so good. What a shame it will never see the light of day,'\u201d Robbie said earlier this year, \u201c\u2018because they are never going to let us make this movie.\u2019 But they did.\u201d\n\nScreenwriter Gerwig admitted it felt like \u201cvertigo\u201d to pen the movie alongside collaborator Noah Baumbach. \u201cWhere do you even begin? What would be the story?\u201d Gerwig recalled wondering. \u201cI think it was that feeling I had that it would be really interesting terror. Usually, that\u2019s where the best stuff is. When you\u2019re like, \u2018I am terrified of that.\u2019 Anything where you\u2019re like, \u2018This could be a career-ender,\u2019 then you\u2019re like, \u2018OK, I probably should do it.'\u201d\n\nFor all the details on \u201cBarbie,\u201d click here."

    "text": "Greta Gerwig's highly anticipated Barbie film has yet to hit theaters, but eager fans are already clamoring for a sequel.\n\nThe filmmaker was joined by stars Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, America Ferrera and more at the movie's pink carpet premiere on Sunday, held at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. Speaking with ET's Will Marfuggi, Gerwig responded to growing speculation surrounding a potential Ken-focused spin-off.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm just focused on getting this one out and crossing all my fingers and toes,\" she said. \"And then we'll see what happens after that.\"\n\nBarbie hits theaters on Friday, July 21.\n\nMeanwhile, it was recently reported that Gerwig has signed on to helm two of the upcoming Narnia films for Netflix. The director told ET on Sunday that she's more focused on a major personal milestone, first.\n\n\"On Aug. 4th, I turn 40,\" she shared with a laugh, \"and this movie's out. So I'm like, I gotta turn 40 and get this movie out, and then I'll figure out what happens next.\"\n\nAs for how she'll ring in her birthday, Gerwig joked she's planned \"a huge dance party.\"\n\nNo doubt Gerwig picked up some moves while shooting Barbie with her talented cast, who put on an epic choreographed dance number in what promises to be one of the film's memorable scenes.\n\n\"Everyone was, like, just so happy to be there,\" Gerwig recalled. \"I think we could have kept shooting this movie for another three months, and they would have just been like, 'Great! Let's learn new choreography and do it again.\"\n\nAxelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic\n\nRobbie, who also served as a producer on the project, told ET that there's a lot she and Gerwig hope viewers are able to take away from the experience of watching the movie.\n\n\"We want, more than anything, for everyone to kind of have the experience they want to have. You can take so much from this film,\" she said. \"It can be a wild carnival ride or it can hit you in some pretty emotional places.\"\n\n\"I think kids are gonna be kind of dazzled by the world of it all and I think adults are gonna really see themselves in some of the characters,\" she added with a smile.\n\nGosling also spoke with ET at the star-studded event, gushing over Robbie's tireless work promoting the film.\n\n\"I think it's all been incredible, everything, the whole way. Margot has produced this film and built this film, structured the process, created the environment for all of us,\" Gosling shared, before gesturing at the elaborate premiere -- which included a pink carpet, a Barbie dream car, and a general sense of fun and whimsy. \"I mean, this is an indication of what it was like to shoot [the movie].\"\n\nHe added, \"She created this, she's made it come true in every way, and it's brilliant.\"\n\nSee more of ET's coverage from the Barbie premiere below.\n\nGet the ET Newsletter Sign up By signing up, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy\n\nRELATED CONTENT:"

Okay, so it's not quite that, but it has joined Pakistani filmmaker Saim Sadiq's milestone queer drama \"Joyland\" on the list of recent films to face bans in certain parts of the world due to its content.\n\nHas Gerwig's much-hyped adaptation of the iconic Mattel, Inc. doll and multimedia franchise landed itself in hot water over Ryan Gosling's Ken and his customized underwear? Or have certain conservative clowns picked up on the subtext of the scene in the \"Barbie\" trailers where Kate McKinnon's Weird Barbie implores Margot Robbie's Barbara Millicent Roberts to strap on a pair of Birkenstocks and journey to the real world to deal with her sudden existential crisis? No, it's another (albeit related) moment in the trailers that's caused a stir: a shot revealing the \"Real World Map\" that McKinnon's character provides to Robbie's Barbie to help her on her personal odyssey.\n\nThis map, which you can see in the below image, is about as accurate a representation of our planet's geography as Wes Anderson's \"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\" is as a portrayal of deep-sea life. (Clearly, Gerwig and her production team should've consulted Cartographer Barbie on the matter.) Nevertheless, its depiction of the Asian continent has resulted in the film being banned in Vietnam.

    "text": "Photos courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures; Melinda Sue Gordon/Universal Pictures\n\nOne of the most hotly debated head-to-head box office match-ups of the year is just four weeks away. While much could change over the next month, here\u2019s how Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie and Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer are shaping up in preliminary tracking.\n\nBarbie\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures\n\nJuly 21, 2023 (WIDE)\n\nOpening Weekend Range: $55M-$85M\n\nDomestic Total Range: $120M-$226M\n\nPROS:\n\nBarbie has been a remarkable performer across the social media spectrum thanks to a vocal fan base and meme-driven activity across TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and other platforms.\n\nAs a generational brand, Barbie has strong appeal to women of various ages and should benefit from the voice of director and co-writer Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird, Little Women) and the presence of A-Listers Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as the leads.\n\nOutside of The Little Mermaid, very few of this summer\u2019s tentpole films are catering so directly to women, leaving Barbie positioned for a strong performance courting an under-served audience. Early sales reflect this with, with Barbie\u2019s day-one pre-sales coming in 46 percent higher than Mermaid\u2018s comparable period.\n\nCONS:\n\nIt\u2019s challenging at this stage to determine to what extent online and fandom buzz will translate to real world interest. That\u2019s especially true given the film\u2019s seemingly more mature focus; its satirical comedy bent could put a ceiling on family turnout relative to the broader multi-generational appeal of The Super Mario Bros. Movie.\n\nPremium screen footprints will be very low for Barbie, with other films dominating that space throughout July. That not only lowers Barbie\u2018s potential average ticket prices, but\u2014as audiences increasingly favor a premium viewing experience\u2014could have a negative impact on attendance.\n\nWhile early pre-sales are strong for previews on Wednesday and Thursday, it remains to be seen whether or not the film will be able to gain traction outside the die-hard fan base in the weeks ahead.\n\nOppenheimer\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\nJuly 21, 2023 (WIDE)\n\nOpening Weekend Range: $40M-$55M\n\nDomestic Total Range: $137M-$187M\n\nPROS:\n\nDirector Christopher Nolan himself is a reliable box office draw, as shown in the post-Dark Knight era of his career with the success of Dunkirk, Interstellar, and Inception.\n\nCounter-programming potential is strong, with Oppenheimer being one of the few thrillers aimed squarely at adults to receiving a massive marketing push in this day and age.\n\nThere\u2019s minimal direct competition moving into the late summer, with most of the wide releases coming to theaters in Oppenheimer\u2018s first few holdover frames being family-friendly movies.\n\nPre-sales are popping at this stage, with initial models pointing to preview results ahead of last summer\u2019s Nope and Nolan\u2019s own Dunkirk. General moviegoer interest prompted by strong word of mouth from preview audiences could create long-term backloading weeks into the film\u2019s theatrical run\u2014particularly as many seek out IMAX and other PLFs for this particular film.\n\nCONS:\n\nOppenheimer\u2018s three-hour runtime puts even more emphasis on word of mouth\u2014especially given the fact that, while containing a spectacle component, it looks to be Nolan\u2019s most strictly narrative-driven film since The Prestige in 2006.\n\nMen over the age of 25 will be the primary crowd here, and that\u2019s a source of crossover competition with Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, opening one week earlier.\n\nNolan\u2019s Tenet, released under abnormal pandemic-era circumstances, was one of the more divisive films of his career, earning a 76 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nLong Range Box Office Forecast & 2023\u2019s Upcoming Calendar\n\n(as of 6/23/23)\n\nRelease Date Title 3-Day (FSS) Opening Low/High Range Pinpoint % Chg from Last Week Domestic Total Low/High Range Pinpoint % Chg from Last Week Distributor 6/30/2023 Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny $68,000,000 \u2013 $95,000,000 -9% $211,000,000 \u2013 $325,000,000 Disney / Lucasfilm 6/30/2023 Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken $12,000,000 \u2013 $17,000,000 -10% $35,000,000 \u2013 $62,000,000 -10% Universal / DreamWorks Animation 7/7/2023 Insidious: The Red Door $24,000,000 \u2013 $29,000,000 -7% $54,000,000 \u2013 $66,000,000 -7% Sony Pictures / Screen Gems 7/7/2023 Joy Ride $11,000,000 \u2013 $16,000,000 -10% $35,000,000 \u2013 $60,000,000 -10% Lionsgate 7/12/2023 Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One $65,000,000 \u2013 $80,000,000 $250,000,000 \u2013 $320,000,000 Paramount Pictures 7/14/2023 PSYCHO-PASS: Providence (Limited) Sony / Crunchyroll 7/14/2023 Theater Camp (Limited) Disney / Searchlight Pictures 7/21/2023 Barbie $55,000,000 \u2013 $85,000,000 $120,000,000 \u2013 $226,000,000 Warner Bros.

Ryan Gosling plays Ken in the upcoming Barbie film, and the demands director Greta Gerwig had for him when crying are interesting, to say the least.\n\nIn The New Yorker's recent feature on Barbie, they revealed that Gerwig told Gosling to \u201ccry the way her four-year-old son cries\u201d for his crying scenes in the film. It remains to be seen how well this advice worked for Gosling in the film, but we now know that when he cries in Barbie, it will sound similar to how Gerwig's actual young son sounds when he cries.\n\nBarbie is the upcoming film based on the famous Mattel dolls. Margot Robbie stars as the titular doll as she embarks on a journey of self-discovery with Ken after being expelled from Barbie Land. In addition to Robbie and Gosling playing their iconic dolls, Dua Lipa, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Simu Liu, and John Cena are just a few of the names of actors playing different variants of the dolls.\n\nRyan Gosling is an accomplished director who has been selective with his projects in recent years. After First Man, he went on an acting hiatus before starring in The Gray Man \u2014 an action-thriller from the Russo brothers for Netflix. He starred in the film with Chris Evans, Ana de Armas, Jessica Henwick, and Reg\u00e9-Jean Page. Aside from Barbie, Gosling's next big role will come in The Fall Guy \u2014 Bullet Train director David Letch's next film.\n\nBarbie will be released on July 21."

    "text": "Greta Gerwig's Barbie could open to anywhere near $80 million or even more on its first day in theatres. The film stars Margot Robbie in the title role and Ryan Gosling as Ken. Meanwhile, Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer starring Cillian Murphy has a shot at $50 million in its box office debut. Both films, two of the year's most-anticipated movies, will be released on July 21. Also read: Here's what Tom Cruise has to say about the clash between Oppenheimer and Barbie Margot Robbie plays Barbie in Greta Gerwig's upcoming film.\n\nAs per a recent report, together Barbie and Oppenheimer promise a near-$200 million weekend at the US box office over July 21-23. While the buzz around Greta Gerwig's star-studded live-action movie Barbie continues to grow as fans gear up for its premiere next month, Oppenheimer is a more serious drama about the origin of the atomic bomb.\n\nStay tuned with breaking news on HT Channel on Facebook. Join Now\n\nMargot Robbie in Barbie (left) and Cillian Murphy in a still from Oppenheimer.\n\nOpening day box office predictions\n\nWhile Warner Bros conservatively is saying $60 million, as per a new Deadline report, Barbie's opening day collection is the 'start of $80 million minimum'. The report added that this, too, is 'a tampered-down expectation because Barbie on paper has all the glitz for a potential $100 million start'.\n\nApart from Barbie presales, the reports also touched upon Oppenheimer's box office predictions saying a \u2018$40 million-to-possible $50 million opening\u2019 is expected for the Christopher Nolan film. Comparing the two films, the report quoted one distribution insider as saying, \u201cIt\u2019s (Oppenheimer is) as much male and older as Barbie is female and younger.\u201d\n\nThe report added that the rest of the near-$200 million weekend over July 21-23 will also include the $35 million collection from the second weekend of Tom Cruise-starrer Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One. The film is scheduled to be released on July 12.\n\nMargot Robbie, Greta Gerwig promote Oppenheimer\n\nOn Friday, Robbie and Gerwig shared three images of themselves standing in front of film posters holding tickets for the Tom Cruise-starrer Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One as well as James Mangold\u2019s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny and Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer.\n\nSharing the pictures from Barbie the movie's official Twitter account, they said in the caption, \u201cMission: Accepted!\u201d\n\nAbout Barbie\n\nAfter Warner Bros. unveiled a first look at the film and its release date on Twitter in April 2022, fans immediately began to speculate what they could expect from the forthcoming Barbie movie.\n\nIn the irreverent comedy, Barbie (Margot Robbie) and Ken (Ryan Gosling) venture beyond the perfect, pink, plastic dreamland they share with dozens of other Barbies and Kens, and find themselves in the real world, much to the annoyance of a Mattel executive played by Will Ferrell.\n\nOppenheimer\n\nChristopher Nolan, known for films such as Tenet, Interstellar, Inception and The Prestige, has directed Oppenheimer. This marks the first time he has made a biopic of a real person \u2013 J Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), the theoretical physicist, who helped develop the first nuclear weapons.\n\nEmily Blunt will be seen as his wife with a supporting cast that includes Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon and Florence Pugh."

The baby is the second of the couple who also has a 4-year-old son, Harold. Baumbach has a 13-year-old son, Rohmer, from his previous marriage. The news of the baby's arrival was not made by the couple earlier.\n\n\n\nDuring the interview, which covers Gerwig\u2019s personal journeys as well as her professional and creative ones, the filmmaker initially discusses her new baby in the context of reflecting on where she is in life.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m about to be 40,\u201d she told the magazine. \u201cAnd there\u2019s something about that where you\u2019re like: Oh! I\u2019m properly middle-aged now.\u2019 All parts of life feel extremely activated.\u201d\n\n\n\nDuring the interview, Gerwig reportedly stepped away to pump breastmilk for her newborn and even shared photos with the publication of her baby.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a little Schmoo. I don\u2019t know if you can tell energy from the picture, but that\u2019s very much his energy,\u201d she said. \u201cThe little guy is sleeping through the night. But I\u2019m still doing that thing where I wake up, every hour to 90 minutes, and just hover. You just keep wanting to look at that baby. So I\u2019m slightly in a twilight state.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe interview marks the first time Gerwig or Baumbach have discussed the birth of their second son. The Oscar-nominated writer and director announced she was pregnant for the second time back in December 2022 during an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon."

    "text": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nGreta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cBarbie\u201d raked in a stunning $155 million domestically over the weekend, giving the film the largest opening weekend of 2023 and the biggest-ever debut for a female director.\n\nThe combined release of \u201cBarbie\u201d and Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d dubbed \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d has become a pop culture sensation \u2013 and one that might revive a struggling movie industry.\n\nBarbenheimer was the fourth highest-grossing industry weekend of all time in North America, totaling $302 million Sunday. Analysts believe it will grow even more when final numbers are reported Monday.\n\nComing in behind \u201cBarbie,\u201d \u201cOppenheimer\u201d opened at $80.5 million domestically over the weekend, according to Comscore. Both movies essentially doubled predictions from weeks ago, Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore, said.\n\nIt\u2019s unprecedented to not only have two films do so well, but also to help each other with the Barbenheimer trend, Dergarabedian said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t really think of any parallels ever,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cWhere both movies became bigger because of each other.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also a tale of two trajectories, Dergarabedian said, between a commercial blockbuster and a three-hour historical drama.\n\n\u201cBoth can be considered absolute homerun hits, and both are gonna perform in the coming weeks in a different way,\u201d Dergarabedian said.\n\nThe two movies can enjoy a summer with little competition, particularly \u201cBarbie\u201d since there haven\u2019t been female-driven blockbusters since \u201cThe Little Mermaid.\u201d\n\n\u201cBarbie\u201d took in $70.5 million in North American theaters Friday, including the Thursday pre-shows.\n\nFrom left, Gabrielle Roitman, Kayla Seffing, Maddy Hiller and Casey Myer take a selfie in front of an \"Oppenheimer\" movie poster before they attended an advance screening of \"Barbie\" on Thursday in Los Angeles. Chris Pizzello/AP\n\nThe movie has made the biggest domestic start for a female-directed movie. Its closest comparison is \u201cWonder Woman\u201d in 2017, directed by Patty Jenkins, which raked in about $38 million domestically on opening day, according to Box Office Mojo. \u201cCaptain Marvel,\u201d co-directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, brought in about $62 million.\n\n\u201cBarbie\u201d was distributed by Warner Bros., owned by CNN\u2019s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nPreview showings of \u201cBarbie\u201d brought in $22.3 million, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe Mattel doll film beat \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d which earned $33 million on Friday \u2013 also an impressive feat.\n\nIt\u2019s a win for director Christopher Nolan, surpassing many of his previous hits: \u201cInception\u201d brought in around $22 million on opening day and \u201cDunkirk\u201d $20 million, though it didn\u2019t reach opening day numbers for \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d and \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises.\u201d\n\nThis kind of foot traffic can be expected for big Marvel or Star Wars movies, Boxoffice Pro chief analyst Shawn Robbins said. It\u2019s a big signal to studios that they don\u2019t have to play it safe all the time, he said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Why does it matter that Barbie is on her tiptoes? 04:30 - Source: CNN\n\n\u201cWhen you have two highly anticipated movies, they\u2019re counterprogramming in a lot of ways and not cannibalizing each other,\u201d Robbins said. \u201cThey can succeed at the same time.\u201d\n\nBefore \u201cBarbie,\u201d \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\u201d had the biggest opening of 2023 at $146.3 million domestic.\n\nA social media driven campaign to see both movies led to a double-feature Barbenheimer phenomenon. That could bring a much needed rebound to the movie industry. Summer releases from earlier in the season, such as \u2018Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\u2019 drew underwhelming box office numbers on opening weekend, drawing $60 million in the United States and $70 million internationally.\n\n\u201cEverything about this movie and the toy is fun,\u201d Sheri Lambert, a marketing professor at Temple University told CNN. \u201cI think people are looking to escape.\u201d\n\nMattel is also not new to nostalgia marketing, making people \u201creally excited\u201d about movies that take them back to the past, Lambert added."

    "text": "The summer box office just went nuclear.\n\nFilmmaker Greta Gerwig\u2018s female-fueled Barbie opened to a historic $162 million domestically, a threshold usually reserved for male-driven superhero fare or marquee IP, such as the final Harry Potter movie. It came in well ahead of an expected $90 million to $110 million and helped fuel one of the biggest weekends in history. And the final figure of $162 million was even ahead of Sunday\u2019s already-stupendous $155 million.\n\nBarbie \u2014 which brings to life Mattel\u2019s iconic fashion doll \u2014 is also strutting to big numbers overseas. The pic launched to an impressive $194.3 from 70 markets for a dazzling global debut of $356.3 million against a $145 million production budget (similar to domestic, Monday actuals were ahead of Sunday estimates). It scored the biggest opening ever for a WB title in major markets, including Mexico ($22.3 million), Brazil ($15.9 million) and Australia ($14.6 million). The U.K. led with $22.9 million, the biggest showing for the studio since the pandemic. Barbie wasn\u2019t expected to make a big splash in Asian markets, although it did do better than expected in China, with $8.2 million.\n\nIn North America, Barbie scored the biggest domestic start ever for a movie directed by a woman, solo or otherwise. The solo crown previously belonged to Patty Jenkins\u2019 Wonder Woman, which started off with $103.3 million domestically in 2017. In 2019, the Anna Boden- and Ryan Fleck-directed Captain Marvel opened to $153 million.\n\nBarbie also set a slew of other records, including landing the top opening of 2023 to date, ahead of The Super Mario Bros. Movie ($146.3 million). The next closest 2023 launch belonged to Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse ($120.7 million), followed by Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 ($118.4 million) and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania ($106.9 million). Otherwise, many releases haven\u2019t been able to inch past the $100 million mark.\n\nIt also marks the biggest opening for Barbie stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, the biggest three-day opening for a movie based on a toy \u2014 eclipsing Transformers: Dark of the Moon ($115.9 million) \u2014 and Warners\u2019 biggest opening for a non-DC pic or a sequel.\n\nGerwig\u2019s film towered over Christopher Nolan\u2018s Oppenheimer, the weekend\u2019s other new wide release.\n\nNot that Oppenheimer, from Universal, is any slouch. The three-hour, R-rated historical drama about J. Robert Oppenheimer and the making of the atomic bomb likewise came in well ahead of expectations with $82.4 million (that\u2019s up from Sunday\u2019s estimate of $80.5 million). That\u2019s the filmmaker\u2019s third-biggest domestic debut behind The Dark Knight Rises ($160.9 million) and The Dark Knight ($158.4 million), not adjusted for inflation. It also will come in ahead of recent summer pics including The Flash, Elemental and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.\n\nBarbie is skewing heavily female, or 68 percent, while Oppenheimer is male-dominated (64 percent). The performance of Oppenheimer was almost more surprising to some than Barbie, considering its running time and topic.\n\nOther stats: Oppenheimer ranks as the third-biggest opening ever for a biographical film in North America behind American Sniper ($89.3 million) and The Passion of the Christ ($83.8 million), not adjusted for inflation.\n\nOverseas, Oppenheimer launched with a strong $98 million from 78 markets, up from Sunday\u2019s estimate of $93.7 million. The film was Nolan\u2019s biggest non-superhero opening in no fewer than 55 markets. The film\u2019s global start is $180.4 million against a $100 million production budget.\n\nHeading into the weekend, tracking suggested Nolan\u2019s film would start off with a solid $50 million domestically.\n\nThe one-two punch of Barbie and Oppenheimer \u2014 a phenomenon dubbed \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d \u2014 was a needed boost for moviegoing and the box office, which has yet to recover fully from the pandemic. This will be the first three-day weekend in history when one movie earns $100 million or more and another $50 million or more.\n\nRevenue-wise, this is the fourth-biggest weekend of all time and the biggest since Avengers: Endgame, according to Comscore, with combined ticket sales hitting $311.1 million in a rare feat. The sizzling box office is a welcome respite from the ongoing writers and actors strike, which has brought Hollywood to a standstill and sparked worry among theaters owners that studios will begin moving their fall and winter releases if actors can\u2019t promote their films.\n\nBoth Barbie and Oppenheimer were graced with A CinemaScores from audiences in the U.S., and their critics\u2019 scores on Rotten Tomatoes store aren\u2019t far apart \u2014 90 percent versus 93 percent, respectively.\n\nCinemark, one of the country\u2019s largest theater circuits, said the two films fueled the exhibitor\u2019s biggest summer weekend of all time.\n\n\u201cPeople love coming together to experience great storytelling in a movie theater, as proven yet again by the sheer volume of consumers who visited our locations to see Barbie and Oppenheimer during opening weekend,\u201d said Cinemark chief marketing and content officer Wanda Gierhart Fearing. \u201cIt appears Barbie actually is everything, and Christopher Nolan fans turned out in droves to see his newest masterpiece in the larger-than-life theatrical format that he intended. Congratulations to our studio partners, as well as the entire creative community for delivering films that generate these record-breaking results.\u201d\n\nBarbenheimer isn\u2019t making life easy for Tom Cruise starrer Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning, Part One. The film tumbled a steep 65 percent to $19.4 million for a domestic total of $118.6 million. It held up better overseas, where it earned another $55 million from 72 markets for a foreign tally of $252.1 million and $370.9 million globally.\n\nParamount\u2019s seventh Mission: Impossible film had to contend with losing Imax screens to Oppenheimer in addition to losing other premium large format screens to either Oppenheimer or Barbie. The upcharge for Imax and premium large-format screens is significant and can have a big impact on the bottom line.\n\nAngel Studios\u2019 faith-based political thriller Sound of Freedom enjoyed another strong weekend. And, in the U.S., it beat narrowly Dead Reckoning with $19.9 million for a cume of $124.4 million, ahead of MI7.\n\nSound of Freedom stars The Passion of the Christ\u2019s Jim Caviezel as the real-life Tim Ballard, who worked as an agent for the Department of Homeland Security before embarking on his own quest to bring child traffickers to justice. While the conservative-leaning Sound of Freedom has been discussed on QAnon message boards, Angel says it isn\u2019t a QAnon movie. In late 2021, Caviezel spoke at a QAnon convention in Las Vegas, where he invoked the QAnon slogan, \u201cThe storm is upon us.\u201d\n\nJuly 23, 7:25 a.m.: Updated with weekend estimates.\n\nJuly 23, 9:20 a.m.: Updated with foreign estimates.\n\nJuly 23, 1:00 p.m.: Updated with revised estimates for Sound of Freedom.\n\nJuly 24, 7 a.m.: Updated with Monday actuals for Barbie and Oppenheimer.\n\nJuly 24, 4:02 p.m.: Updated with Monday actuals for Mission: Impossible 7 and Sound of Freedom."

This makes Gerwig the first solo female director with a billion-dollar movie.\n\nAs one half of the viral \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d phenomenon, it isn\u2019t shocking \u201cBarbie\u201d has performed well. And, standing on her own two feet, the doll\u2019s incredible success is not unexpected at all.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in this game for 30 years and the Barbie and Barbenheimer phenomenon is as unprecedented as it was unpredictable,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.\n\nAccording to Dergarabedian, only about 50 films in history, unadjusted for inflation, have hit the billion-dollar mark.\n\nHe added the movie\u2019s marketing campaign was the first hint \u201cBarbie\u201d would be a box office smash. \u201cThe marketing campaign for \u2018Barbie\u2019 set into motion a chain of events that led to the word \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 being added to the popular lexicon by virtue of its shared release date with \u2018Oppenheimer,\u2019 and that\u2019s when we all knew something very special and unique was going to create a much bigger than expected outcome for the film not only for the opening weekend, but for its global run in theaters.\u201d\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Why does it matter that Barbie is on her tiptoes? 04:30 - Source: CNN\n\nIn an interview with Collider last month, Margot Robbie \u2014 who produced the movie in addition to playing the titular character \u2014 shared a premonition she had at a greenlight meeting with studios.\n\n\u201cI think I told them they\u2019d make a billion dollars which, maybe I was overselling, but we had a movie to make!\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBarbie\u201d was distributed by Warner Bros., which is owned by CNN\u2019s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nIts global success was driven by box office sales in some of the world\u2019s largest movie markets, including the United Kingdom, Mexico and Australia. The movie has been the No. 1 release in these markets every weekend since its release, according to tracking site Box Office Mojo.\n\n\u201cBarbie\u201d also performed well in China, the second-largest market in the world and one that has becoming increasingly insular over the past few years. According to experts, franchise films like \u201cTransformers,\u201d \u201cFast and Furious,\u201d and Marvel\u2019s superhero movies tend to perform well with Chinese audiences. While \u201cBarbie\u201d is similar to \u201cTransformers\u201d in that it\u2019s based on an existing toy, it\u2019s \u201cnot an IP that generations of Chinese have grown up with, so you lack the intergenerational appeal that a film like \u2018Barbie\u2019 has in the United States,\u201d said Michael Berry, director of UCLA\u2019s Center for Chinese Studies.\n\nBut Berry, who researches Chinese cinema and pop culture, says Barbie is still iconic around the world, giving the movie a solid springboard for international acclaim.\n\n\u201cChildren in hundreds of countries\u2026 have grown up with the dolls, her imagery\u2026 (but) the film exploits that name-recognition in a very savvy way by playing into both the Barbie lovers and Barbie haters,\u201d he said. \u201cThe film is also able to deftly walk a tightrope that appeals to both na\u00efve and wide-eyed eight-year-old dreamers, who approach the film on one level, and adult audiences, who are able to interpret the film on an entirely different level, full of irony, humor, sexual innuendos, and allegory.\u201d\n\n\u201cBarbie\u201d has become everything from a relationship litmus test to a celebration of womanhood for people who may have come for the hot-pink outfits and stayed for the film\u2019s existential questions.\n\n\u201cDriving that discourse is the film\u2019s embrace of what generations of women have both loved and hated about the brand and what it\u2019s often represented in the past,\u201d said BoxOffice Pro chief analyst Shawn Robbins, adding that the movie \u201chas tapped into cultural conversations about gender roles and female empowerment that aren\u2019t bound by international borders.\u201d"

    "text": "\"Barbie\" is expected to join the billion-dollar club Sunday.\n\nThe bubblegum pink flick from Warner Bros. Discovery and Mattel will top $1 billion in global ticket sales, before the end of the weekend, according to estimates from the studio. Final numbers will be released Monday.\n\nOnly around 50 other films have reached this benchmark.\n\n\"In this march past the billion-dollar threshold, 'Barbie' joins what has become an increasingly exclusive club over the past couple of years,\" said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. \"That's especially true for auteur filmmaker Greta Gerwig becoming the first solo female director to helm a billion-dollar grosser.\"\n\nGerwig joins Anna Boden, co-director of Disney's \"Captain Marvel,\" as the only two women to helm a live-action billion-dollar film. \"Captain Marvel\" reached just shy of $1.13 billion during its theatrical run in 2019, according to data from Comscore.\n\nOn the animation side, Jennifer Lee has two billion-dollar features under her belt, having co-directed \"Frozen\" and \"Frozen II\" with Chris Buck for Disney.\n\nThis also marks the first billion-dollar film for the newly minted Warner Bros. Discovery, which merged in 2022, and only the second movie released in 2023 to do so. Universal's \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" has topped $1.3 billion since its April debut.\n\n\"This monumental box office achievement for 'Barbie' shows what is possible when all of the elements of filmmaking, marketing, distribution, fan engagement and movie theater presentation work in harmony,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst from Comscore. \"And a sprinkling of 'Barbenheimer' magic certainly didn't hurt either.\"\n\nThe success of \"Barbie\" comes at a time when blockbuster-budgeted films have struggled to connect with moviegoing audiences. Nostalgia bait flicks like Disney's \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\" as well as sequels for Paramount's Mission Impossible series and Universal's Fast and Furious franchise failed to lure in audiences. Each film tallied less than $200 million in domestic box office receipts.\n\n\"Barbie\" shows that moviegoers are still interested in leaving their couches for quality films and unique communal experiences. Movie theaters big and small announced record ticket sales in the month of July as pink-clad audiences packed theaters.\n\n\"The box office powerhouse isn't done yet as the coming weeks offer little in the way of direct competition, giving 'Barbie' plenty of runway to continue building on this success,\" Robbins said.\n\nDisclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC.\n\nCORRECTION: This article has been updated to show that, on the animation side, Jennifer Lee has two billion-dollar features under her belt, having co-directed \"Frozen\" and \"Frozen II\" with Chris Buck for Disney."

    "text": "\u201cBarbenheimer\u201d is probably the film event of the year. The simultaneous premieres of two Hollywood blockbusters by two cult directors: Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie, a pink fantasy comedy and Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer, a sombre and psychedelic drama.\n\nThe juxtaposition of atmosphere, characters and issues unleashed lively debates in the press and on social media, ranging from hilarious memes to existential questions. For the Greenpeace community, these two films echo past and present campaigns against very real existential threats: deforestation, plastic pollution and nuclear annihilation.\n\nBarbie: a long love affair with deforestation and plastic\n\nGerwig\u2019s Barbie is a funny and resolutely feminist film. It\u2019s funny and touching to see how everything goes wrong in this perfect universe when the main Barbie, played by actress Margot Robbie, starts to think about death. This existential crisis sees Barbie embark on a journey of discovery to the \u2018real world\u2019: Los Angeles.\n\nIn the REAL real world, Barbie is a plastic doll released by Mattel 60 years ago. The company said that 58 million dolls are sold every year, or about 100 dolls every minute, to people in 150 countries. While Gerwig\u2019s Barbie may worry about her expiry date in reality she will most likely last forever, lost in landfills and discarded in dumps.\n\nBeyond her baggage (promoting an unrealistic body image among young girls, maintaining anti-feminist sexist stereotypes and propagating a particular standard of beauty, marginalising people of colour), Barbie has also had a long love affair with plastic \u2014 and ended a very toxic one with deforestation after a very intense intervention.\n\nAction at Mattel HQ in California, June 2011 \u2013 Greenpeace activists dressed as \u201cKen\u201d dolls hang two huge banners at Mattel headquarters. The banner depicts an angry \u201cKen\u201d with a clear message to his former girlfriend: \u201cBarbie It\u2019s Over. I Don\u2019t Date Girls That Are Into Deforestation.\u201d \u00a9 Gus Ruelas / Greenpeace\n\nGreenpeace International investigators had found that the toymaker Mattel was using packaging from materials supplied by Asia Pulp and Paper (APP), which had been exposed for wrecking Indonesia\u2019s rainforests. At the time, Mattel promised to stop using deforestation-linked materials in its packaging. A promising victory, a step against pulp and paper companies that continue to threaten some of the world\u2019s largest remaining rainforests.\n\nOne from the archives: Did you know back in 2011 there was something else that caused Barbie to go viral? This satirical video! Greenpeace and thousands of other supporters were there for the ride.\n\nThen there\u2019s Barbie\u2019s not-so-fantastic \u201cplastic\u201d which, despite being served in miniature pieces, is still a massive issue today! According to a 2014 United Nations Environment Programme report, the toy industry uses more plastic in its actual products on a revenue basis than any other sector. Last year, American researchers quantified what each Barbie doll costs the climate. Every 182-gram Barbie causes about 660 grams of carbon emissions, including plastic production, manufacture and transport.\n\nThis is a useful reminder that plastic is just fossil fuel in disguise (99% of plastic is made from fossil fuels, like fracked gas and oil) and that it contributes to climate change throughout all its life cycle. That\u2019s why Greenpeace is continuing to fight for an ambitious global plastics treaty that would cap and phase down plastic production, including a phase-out of virgin plastic production.\n\nLet\u2019s end the age of plastic! Ask world leaders to support a strong global plastic treaty that addresses the whole life cycle of plastic. Take action\n\nOppenheimer: the fever dream that reminds us of the horror of nuclear weapons\n\nIn the late 1920s, J. Robert Oppenheimer was one of many promising physicists who had left America to study in Europe. He soon developed a passion for quantum mechanics and constantly dreamt of that other world: that of atoms, matter and dead stars collapsing in on themselves in the silence of space.\n\nOppenheimer did not yet know that he would help create the atomic bomb, contributing to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. He had not yet \u201cbecome death, the destroyer of worlds\u201d.\n\nJanuary 1998 \u2013 Nuclear Testing Action at Taj Mahal in India. The Greenpeace hot air balloon with the slogan \u2018Nuclear Disarmament Now!\u2019 flies above the famous Taj Mahal in a protest against nuclear testing in India. \u00a9 Greenpeace / Steve Morgan\n\nNuclear arms are the most destructive, indiscriminate and monstrous weapons ever made. In January 2021, we celebrated a major milestone: the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) is now part of international law.\n\nThis new treaty will make it harder for world leaders to describe nuclear weapons as a legitimate and useful means to provide security. It creates a global norm against nuclear weapons that will hopefully lead us to a nuclear-free world in the future.\n\nIn the age of global heating the threat of a nuclear winter is far from over: in June 2023, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) released its annual assessment of the state of armaments, disarmament and international security, which shows that nuclear arsenals are being fortified around the world.\n\nThe global stockpile of nuclear weapons is expected to rise due to global tensions, according to leading arms watchdog SIPRI https://t.co/sEE1uZmV1k pic.twitter.com/vAPVWtVE2D \u2014 Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) June 13, 2022\n\n\u201cNuclear weapons, developed to win wars, are a threat of total annihilation (\u2026) No sustainable society is possible with these weapons continually poised for indiscriminate slaughter.\u201d These are the words of Kazumi Matsui, the mayor of Hiroshima since 2011.\n\nEliminating nuclear weapons is the only guarantee they will never be used. Nuclear power and nuclear weapons are two sides of the same coin. In order to end all nuclear threats, we must phase out both.\n\nA movie ending: We ALL live happily ever after\n\nSo, what are we to do if we want to live happily ever after? As we tackle the crises of climate, inequality and health, it\u2019s clear there isn\u2019t one approach, but a single driver: greed. Shaping a sustainable equitable future that puts people and the planet before corporate greed and elite profiteering is necessary, and possible.\n\nBuilding a better world is within our reach \u2014 and it takes all of us."

    "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A week later, the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d boom has not abated.\n\nWhat You Need To Know Seven days after Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cBarbie\u201d and Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer\u201d conspired to set box office records, the two films held unusually strongly in theaters \u201cBarbie\u201d took in a massive $93 million in its second weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday \u201cOppenheimer\" again landed in second place with an estimated $46.2 million New release \u201cHaunted Mansion\u201d was easily overshadowed by the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d blitz, debuting with $24 million domestically\n\nSeven days after Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cBarbie\u201d and Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer\u201d conspired to set box office records, the two films held unusually strongly in theaters. \u201cBarbie\u201d took in a massive $93 million in its second weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. \u201cOppenheimer\u201d stayed in second with a robust $46.2 million. Sales for the two movies dipped 43% and 44%, respectably \u2014 well, shy of the usual week-two drops.\n\n\u201cBarbenheimer\u201d has proven to be not a one-weekend phenomenon but an ongoing box-office bonanza. The two movies combined have already surpassed $1 billion in worldwide ticket sales. Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore, calls it \u201ca touchstone moment for movies, moviegoers and movie theaters.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving two movies from rival studios linked in this way and both boosting each other\u2019s fortunes \u2014 both box-office wise and it terms of their profile \u2014 I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a comp for this in the annals of box-office history,\u201d said Dergarabedian. \u201cThere\u2019s really no comparison for this.\u201d\n\nFollowing its year-best $162 million opening, the pink-infused pop sensation of \u201cBarbie\u201d saw remarkably sustained business through the week and into the weekend. The film outpaced Nolan\u2019s \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d to have the best first 11 days in theaters of any Warner Bros. release ever.\n\n\u201cBarbie\u201d has rapidly accumulated $351.4 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters, a rate that will soon make it the biggest box-office hit of the summer. Every day it\u2019s played, \u201cBarbie\u201d has made at least $20 million.\n\nAnd the \u201cBarbie\u201d effect isn\u2019t just in North America. The film made $122.2 million internationally over the weekend. Its global tally has reached $775 million. It\u2019s the kind of business that astounds even veteran studio executives.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a crazy number,\u201d said Jeff Goldstein, distribution chief for Warner Bros. \u201cThere\u2019s just a built-in audience that wants to be part of the zeitgeist of the moment. Wherever you go, people are wearing pink. Pink is taking over the world.\u201d\n\nAmid the frenzy, \u201cBarbie\u201d is already attracting a lot of repeat moviegoers. Goldstein estimates that 12% of sales are people going back with friends or family to see it again.\n\nFor a movie industry that has be trying to regain its pre-pandemic footing \u2014 and that now finds itself largely shuttered due to actors and screenwriters strikes \u2014 the sensations of \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d have showed what\u2019s possible when everything lines up just right.\n\n\u201cPost-pandemic, there\u2019s no ceiling and there\u2019s no floor,\u201d said Goldstein. \u201cThe movies that miss really miss big time and the movies that work really work big time.\u201d\n\nUniversal Pictures\u2019 \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d meanwhile, is performing more like a superhero movie than a three-hour film about scientists talking.\n\nNolan\u2019s drama starring Cillian Murphy as atomic bomb physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer has accrued $174.1 million domestically thus far. With an additional $72.4 million in international cinemas, \u201cOppenheimer\u201d has already surpassed $400 million globally.\n\nShowings in IMAX have typically been sold out. \u201cOppenheimer\u201d has made $80 million worldwide on IMAX. The large-format exhibitor said Sunday that it will extend the film\u2019s run through Aug. 13.\n\nThe week\u2019s top new release, Walt Disney Co.\u2019s \u201cHaunted Mansion,\u201d an adaptation of the Disney theme park attraction, was easily overshadowed by the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d blitz. The film, which cost about $150 million, debuted with $24 million domestically and $9 million in overseas sales. \u201cHaunted Mansion,\u201d directed by Justin Simien (\u201cDear White People,\u201d \u201cBad Hair\u201d) and starring an ensemble of LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish, Owen Wilson, Danny DeVito and Rosario Dawson, struggled to overcome mediocre reviews.\n\n\u201cTalk to Me,\u201d the A24 supernatural horror film fared better. It debuted with $10 million. The film, directed by Australian filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou and starring Sophie Wilde, was a midnight premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January and received terrific reviews from critics (95% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes). It was made for a modest $4.5 million.\n\nWhile theaters being flush with moviegoers has been a huge boon to the film industry, it\u2019s been tougher sledding for Tom Cruise, the so-called savior of the movies last summer with \u201cTop Gun: Maverick.\u201d \u201cMission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part I,\u201d which debuted the week before the arrival of \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d grossed $10.7 million in its third weekend. The film starring Cruise and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, has grossed $139.2 million domestically and $309.3 million oveseas.\n\nInstead, the sleeper hit \u201cSound of Freedom\u201d has been the best performing non-\u201cBarbenheimer\u201d release in theaters. The Angel Studios\u2019 release, which is counting crowdfunding pay-it-forward sales in its box office totals, made $12.4 million in its fourth weekend, bringing its haul thus far to nearly $150 million.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.\n\n1. \u201cBarbie,\u201d $93 million.\n\n2. \u201cOpppenheimer,\u201d $46.2 million.\n\n3. \u201cHaunted Mansion,\u201d $24.2 million.\n\n4. \u201cSound of Freedom,\u201d $12.4 million.\n\n5. \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One,\u201d $10.7 million.\n\n6. \u201cTalk to Me,\u201d $10 million.\n\n7. \u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,\u201d $4 million.\n\n8. \u201cElemental,\u201d $3.4 million.\n\n9. \u201cInsidious: The Red Door,\u201d $3.2 million.\n\n10. \u201cRocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani,\u201d $1.6 million."

    "text": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nDuring its first few days in theaters, \u201cBarbie\u201d raked in $337 million globally in the box office, the largest opening weekend of 2023 so far. But even before the numbers came in, \u201cBarbie\u201d was a merchandising hit.\n\nThe film had been generating hype for months, thanks to a star-studded cast, beloved director, dazzling aesthetic \u2013 and a seemingly endless array of Barbie-themed merchandise.\n\nIn June, brand strategist Moshe Isaacian started keeping track of the official partnerships on Twitter. A scroll through his thread shows, among other things: A gaming console, pair of shoes, hotel, house, insurance commercial, a candle, rugs, nail polish, roller blades, a toy car, a lunchbox, dog apparel, a toothbrush and several other items emblazoned with the Barbie logo, awash in hot pink.\n\nIsaacian has posted about roughly 50 partnerships. That\u2019s, almost literally, the half of it: Mattel, maker of the iconic toy, has made over 100 brand deals for the movie, which is distributed by Warner Bros. (CNN and Warner Bros. are both owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n\nA man poses in a large Barbie doll box at Bloomingdale's in New York, ahead of the movie's release. Richard Drew/AP\n\nFor marketers, \u201cBarbie\u201d has turned into a massive opportunity: A rosy, fizzy way to get new customers \u2013 of all ages \u2013 and stay culturally relevant. That\u2019s always a good opportunity, but especially so in the current environment, where even seemingly benign marketing campaigns can be controversial.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not often that so much attention is focused on a single event, like a movie premier.\n\n\u201cWe live in such a fragmented world, that it is really hard for events to break through the clutter,\u201d said Tim Calkins, associate chair of the marketing department at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management. \u201cThese shared moments, when they really catch on, have enormous power.\u201d\n\nThe Barbie effect\n\nFor some bars and restaurants, Barbie mania has led to a rush of patrons.\n\nIn the spring, when Barbie memes started leaving their glittery trail across the internet, the team at Wunder Garten, a beer garden and event space in Washington, DC, started to take notice.\n\nAround that time, it started planning Barbie parties: Celebrations with themed cocktails, pink food and plenty of opportunities to show off Barbiecore outfits in the Instagram-friendly venue, including life-size hot pink Barbie and Ken boxes.\n\n\u201cWe were expecting a very big turnout, and we got a very, very big turnout,\u201d said Leana Chavez, assistant manager at Wunder Garten.\n\nA Barbie-inspired cabana at Wunder Garten.

The candle drove a 39% increase in sales in June, year-over-year, according to Lauren McCord, General Manager of Homesick. And most of that came from new customers: Over 70% of Dreamhouse purchases were made by new clients.\n\nThe Barbie brand is particularly powerful because it appeals to multiple generations, noted Christie Nordhielm, an associate teaching professor of marketing at Georgetown University\u2019s McDonough School of Business.\n\nBy marketing Barbie products to adults, large retailers may be able to get them to buy similar products for kids.\n\n\u201cParents, or possibly other family members, will gatekeep on whether this product comes in,\u201d she said. With Barbie products that appeal to grown-ups, marketers are \u201cgetting that interactivity between adults and children, that bonding,\u201d which can also be used as a selling point.\n\nGap may benefit from this aspect of the marketing. The clothing retailer offers a Barbie line that includes Gap and Barbie branded t-shirts, jackets and more, for both kids and adults. A Gap spokesperson noted that the collection \u201chas been killing it across all categories.\u201d The relationship between Gap and Mattel runs deep: On Wednesday, Gap announced that its new CEO will be Richard Dickson, who currently serves as Mattel\u2019s president and chief operating officer.\n\nBarbie themed merchandise at a Gap store in New York. Richard B. Levine/Levine Roberts/ZUMA Press\n\nIn retrospect, and with huge box office numbers under its belt, it seems clear why so many companies would want to work with \u201cBarbie.\u201d But partner products were conceived and launched well before the movie premiered, when there was a possibility that it wouldn\u2019t be so well received. During that period of uncertainty, they may have been soothed by the sheer volume of partnerships.\n\nIn other words, if \u201cBarbie\u201d was a flop, they\u2019d all go down together.\n\nStrength in numbers\n\nThere are plenty of ways for \u201cBarbie\u201d to have gone wrong.\n\nThe doll itself has a spotty history, and with its inhuman proportions has been accused of upholding unrealistic beauty standards. Plus, movies in general are not a safe financial bet: Aside from breakthroughs like \u201cBarbie\u201d and Oppenheimer, box office sales have been disappointing, making a sluggish return after pandemic-era theater closures.\n\nSome Barbie decoration at a Zara store in Gran Via street in Madrid on July 22. David Canales/SOPA Images/Shutterstock\n\nAnd there was no guarantee that people would like the movie. Some might still see Barbie as anti-feminist, or anti-male, and the movie as little more than a major corporate effort to boost the doll\u2019s sales. Others may have been turned off by the relentless marketing, especially for a movie with a message that (spoiler alert) people don\u2019t need to buy products to feel good about themselves. And then there\u2019s the fact that \u201cBarbie\u201d was directed by a woman and marketed to women, which can inspire online trolling.\n\nFor brand partners, \u201cthere was some risk that this movie might be a total bomb,\u201d said David Reibstein, professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton business school. But that risk was \u201cdampened by the fact that others are doing it. And so if we look bad, well, we\u2019re not alone.\u201d\n\nA lucky few could stay at Barbie's iconic Malibu Dreamhouse, in Malibu, California, via Airbnb. Mike Blake/Reuters\n\nBut while there have been calls to boycott the film, they don\u2019t seem to have gotten much traction. Now, with everything coming up Barbie, marketers may lose out by staying away.\n\n\u201cI think there is a risk of not doing it,\u201d Reibstein said. \u201cIf you happen to be a retailer and you see the other retailers doing it, you sort of feel like you need to be on the bandwagon\u2026 and not miss whatever Barbie wave there might be.\u201d At this stage, that may mean using the success of \u201cBarbie\u201d to market pre-existing hot pink products.\n\nBut with everyone going in, it becomes even harder to stand out.\n\nThis Barbie is just like all the others\n\nIf your promotion is too similar to another, \u201cit\u2019s going to limit the lift that you get, because it\u2019s just more of the same,\u201d said Northwestern\u2019s Calkins. Once you see one Barbie-pink nail polish, for example, you probably won\u2019t be wowed by another.\n\nIsaacian, who started the Twitter thread, thinks Mattel has been strategic in choosing its partners, even though there are so many.\n\nCold Stone Creamery's Barbie-themed ice cream in a Barbie-themed cup. From Cold Stone Creamery/Facebook\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve really done a good job of making almost all parts of the movie feel tangible,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Reibstein, the collaboration that stood out was the Airbnb Malibu Dreamhouse. Staying at the Dreamhouse is free, but Airbnb only made it available for two nights in July.\n\nPrior to those dates, model and TV personality Chrissy Teigen shared photos of herself and her family in the Instagram-friendly house, including one boomerang video of her in a hot pink outfit and Ken-inspired roller blades.\n\nNordhielm pointed to Cold Stone Creamery\u2019s Barbie pink cotton candy ice cream as a standout. \u201cIt\u201ds a happy product, it\u2019s a family product,\u201d she said."

    "text": "BEIRUT, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Lebanon's culture minister moved to ban the film \"Barbie\" from cinemas on Wednesday, saying it \"promotes homosexuality\" and contradicts religious values.\n\nMinister Mohammad Mortada is backed by powerful Shi'ite armed group Hezbollah, whose head Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has ramped up his rhetoric against the LGBT community, referring in a recent speech to Islamic texts that call for punishing offenders with death.\n\nMortada's decision said the film was found to \"promote homosexuality and sexual transformation\" and \"contradicts values of faith and morality\" by diminishing the importance of the family unit.\n\nBased on Mortada's move, Interior Minister Bassam Mawlawi in turn asked General Security's censorship committee, which falls under the interior ministry and is traditionally responsible for censorship decisions, to review the film and give its recommendation.\n\nKuwait followed in Lebanon's footsteps later in the day, saying it had banned \"Barbie\" and supernatural horror film \"Talk to Me\" to protect \"public ethics and social traditions\", the state news agency said.\n\nLebanon was the first Arab country to hold a gay pride week in 2017 and has generally been seen as a safe haven for the LGBT community in the broadly conservative Middle East.\n\nPeople walk past a promotional poster of film \"Barbie\" in Tokyo, Japan, August 3, 2023. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nBut the issue has come into sharper focus recently, sparking tensions. Mawlawi last year took a decision to ban events \"promoting sexual perversion\" in Lebanon, understood to refer to LGBT-friendly gatherings.\n\nIn a speech last month, Nasrallah called on Lebanese authorities to take action against materials he deemed to be promoting homosexuality, including by \"banning\" them.\n\nHe said homosexuality posed an \"imminent danger\" to Lebanon and should be \"confronted\". In the case of a homosexual act, Nasrallah said in late July, \"from the first time, even if he is unmarried, he is killed\".\n\nOn Tuesday, Lebanon's cabinet urged citizens to \"cling\" to family values following a meeting with the country's top Christian cleric Patriarch Bechara Boutros al-Rai, although it did not mention the LGBT community specifically.\n\nAyman Mhanna, executive director at the non-profit civic Samir Kassir Foundation, told Reuters that Mortada's move came amid \"a wave of bigotry\".\n\n\"This is part of a broader campaign that is bringing together Hezbollah, the Christian far right, and other top religious leaders in a focused campaign against LGBT people,\" Mhanna said.\n\nStarring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Barbie and Ken, the movie sends Mattel Inc's (MAT.O) doll on an adventure into the real world. The film has topped $1 billion in box office ticket sales worldwide since its July 21 debut.\n\nReporting by Laila Bassam and Maya Gebeily; Editing by Toby Chopra, Nick Macfie & Shri Navaratnam\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Discovery CEO David Zaslav on the conglom\u2019s Q2 earnings call about what will be the first pic to hit $1 billion under his reign.\n\nIn celebrating the pic\u2019s success, he indicated that the movie would hit streaming service Max in the fall.\n\nHowever, on a long theatrical window.\n\n\u201cWe really believe in the motion picture window \u2014 let it play out \u2026 go into PVOD, take it through the windows that have worked forever [in the business],\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it goes on Max, it will have a good impact in the fall.\u201d\n\nSeparately, Deadline has noticed that Barbie will hit airlines this September.\n\nRELATED: 2023 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming\n\nZaslav since taking charge of Warner Bros Discovery has championed the theatrical window passionately, unlike the former Warner Bros Media administration that upset the town with their theatrical-day-and-date experiment on HBO Max during Covid.\n\nZaslav also mentioned how he rallied all the departments at the conglom to work together to build \u201cThe Summer of Barbie\u201c. This included a Barbie dreamhouse special on HGTV which premiered to 4M viewers and was broadcasted in 106 countries as well as Barbie Food Network special and a sneak peek during NBA Finals on Turner sports. It\u2019s a cross vertical promo playbook that Zaslav executed for HBO\u2019s House of the Dragon and The Last of Us, as well as the videogame Hogwarts Legacy.\n\nRELATED: July Domestic Box Office On Fire With $1.37 Billion, Second Best Ever\n\n\u201cAll of our platforms can have an impact globally,\u201d he said today.\n\n\u201cIt starts with great content,\u201d he continued giving a shoutout to Margot Robbie and Barbie director Greta Gerwig\u2019s globe-trotting promotion for the tentpole.\n\nBarbie will cross the $400M mark at the domestic box office today, in its 14th day, beating Top Gun: Maverick and Super Mario Bros Movie to that benchmark, both crossing in 18 days. The Mattel doll should cross the $1 billion mark on either Sunday or Monday. Total global outlook per sources is $1.3 billion for Barbie.\n\nRELATED: Warner Bros. U.S. Responds To Barbenheimer Criticism Out Of Japan\n\nWBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels said today on the call that the fruits of Barbie will be realized in Q3 for the company.\n\nMeanwhile, DC\u2019s The Flash, which had a 31-day theatrical window to PVOD, was considered a drag on WBD\u2019s lackluster Q2 today.\n\nRELATED: International Cinema Chain Vue Records \u201cBest Ever Week\u201d Thanks To \u2018Barbie\u2019 & \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019\n\nBarbie was greenlit and shepherded by the former Warners motion picture administration led by Toby Emmerich and Courtenay Valenti."

    "text": "\u201cThink pink! think pink! when you shop for summer clothes. Think pink! think pink! if you want that quelque chose.\u201d\n\nThat advice, sung as an epiphany in the 1957 musical film \u201cFunny Face,\u201d has definitely been heeded \u2014 just take a look around at fashion and media. The fascination around pink \u2014 each shade and hue with its own connotation \u2014 has shaped those cultural engines for generations, revving into full force as we reach peak \u201cBarbie\u201d season.\n\nThe color has been a crucial detail for films and television \u2014 from that scene in \u201cFunny Face,\u201d to Elle Woods sporting her iconic head-to-toe vibrant pink courtroom outfit in 2001\u2019s \u201cLegally Blonde,\u201d to \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d where the shades of pink in costuming play a symbolic role in the final season. And, now, with the Greta Gerwig-helmed film\u2019s release, the vividly hot \u201cBarbie Pink\u201d is inescapable.\n\nThroughout history, designers, artists, and brands have played with the emotions the color evokes, shaping meanings that are ever-evolving. From gender to class, those associations have constantly been challenged, flipped and subverted \u2014 while the definition of pink is always in flux, there\u2019s one constant: its cultural staying power.The meanings behind the many shades of pink\n\nPink first became fashionable in the 18th century in the French court, because of a new source of dye that imparted a more vivid, long-lasting color in fabrics, explained Valerie Steele, director of The Museum at FIT and one of the authors of \u201cPink: The History of a Punk, Pretty, Powerful Color.\u201d\n\nSince then, the cachet of pink has ebbed and flowed; as pink dyes became more accessible to the working class, the color lost its association with wealth and prestige.\n\nWhen first popularized, it was worn by men and women alike, but in the 1920s, U.S. department stores claimed blue for boys and pink for girls.\n\n\u201cIt was really totally arbitrary,\u201d Steele said of the correlation.\n\nFast forward a few generations to 2016, when Pantone chose \u201cRose Quartz\u201d as a color of the year: The muted dusty pink is calming but also connotes strength, said Laurie Pressman, vice president of the Pantone Color Institute. She told The Associated Press one of the reasons for the pick was the rise of the \u201cgender blur.\u201d (The color was quickly embraced by fashion and interior designers, earning the moniker of \u201cmillennial pink.\u201d)\n\nThat symbiotic influence \u2014 pink providing texture to and receiving a boost from a cultural force \u2014 was evident the next year at the Women\u2019s March on Washington, where demonstrators donned loudly pink \u201cpussy hats.\u201d\n\n\u201cPink has become, in many ways, the most controversial color in fashion, and fashion is always interested in controversy,\u201d Steele said.\n\nFor British artist Stuart Semple, pink is the color of rebellion and taking space. Semple created the \u201cpinkest pink\u201d paint in 2016 as a reaction to artist Anish Kapoor purchasing and reserving the artistic rights to the Vantablack pigment, said to be the world\u2019s blackest black.\n\nSemple has made his paint \u2014 intended to be the fluorescent apotheosis of the color \u2014 accessible to the world at an affordable price.\n\n\u201cI thought it was wrong for me to hold this amazing color that I\u2019d made. So I wanted to make it available to everyone,\u201d Semple told the AP. \u201cApart from him (Kapoor), for obvious reasons.\u201d\n\nSemple chose pink because it was the \u201cantithesis\u201d of black and it\u2019s a color that\u2019s political, vibrant and \u201cthe perfect thing to sort of challenge conventions.\u201d\n\nTanisha Ford, a history professor at The Graduate Center at the City University of New York, noted how male artists \u2014 specifically male artists of color like Bad Bunny; Tyler, The Creator, and Jaden Smith \u2014 have generated more complex conversations about masculinity by wearing pink clothing.\n\nThe color is subversive but also used in a very \u201ctongue-and-cheek kind of way,\u201d Ford said.\n\n\u201cPeople of color have been denied leisure and denied rest,\u201d Ford said. \u201cSo \u2026 if you\u2019re wearing these preppy clothes or you\u2019re wearing your yacht chic clothes, you are staking a claim into leisure.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes down to it, there\u2019s a simple reason why people still wear pink: It looks good.\n\n\u201cAt its core, it\u2019s a very flattering color,\u201d Barry Manuel, a New York University fashion professor says.\n\nThe season of \u2018Barbie Pink\u2019\n\nPink has long been associated with the Barbie brand \u2014 she even has her own Pantone color. But even though Barbie was first released in 1959, Mattel didn\u2019t star featuring predominantly pink packaging until the 1970s, said Kim Culmone, Mattel\u2019s senior vice president and global head of Barbie and fashion dolls design.\n\nWhen discussing shades of pink associated with the brand, Culmone noted that there\u2019s something inspiring and joyful about \u201cBarbie Pink.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost importantly it\u2019s, for us, it\u2019s really a symbolism of empowerment. Barbie is the original girl empowerment brand,\u201d Culmone said.\n\nIt was no surprise that the film\u2019s first full-length trailer dripped pink, showing Barbie Land as a fun, cotton candy wonderland that looks a little artificial. After the trailer was released, news reports claimed the production team bought so many cans of pink paint that it depleted the world\u2019s supply.\n\nGerwig told the AP that she wasn\u2019t so sure about that \u2014 but she did confirm the crew did buy every can of pink paint from one particular company. The director explained it was important to use pink paint to capture older film techniques and to make the audience feel like Barbie Land was tactile.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s toys, and what are toys but things that you touch? And so getting all that pink paint, to paint everything was important,\u201d Gerwig said.\n\nCapitalizing on color\n\nSemple, however, has taken issue with the monopoly and the \u201cpress done around running out the paint supply.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s true or not, it\u2019s still not very nice,\u201d he told the AP.\n\nSemple explains he\u2019s standing up to what he calls \u201cBig Color,\u201d where corporations dominate the usage. He cited \u201cTiffany Blue,\u201d the trademark color of the jewelry company.\n\nIn response to \u201cBarbie,\u201d Semple went back to his previous game plan and created \u201cthe Barbiest pink.\u201d Called \u201cPinkie,\u201d anyone can buy the paint color \u2014 as long as they attest to not being employed by Mattel.\n\n\u201cColors should belong to everybody. And corporations should do what they do best, which is corporate stuff, and perhaps leave colors alone,\u201d Semple said.\n\nWhen asked for comment on Semple\u2019s \u201cPinkie\u201d paint, a Mattel spokesperson simply responded in an email, \u201cWhile not a registered trademark, Barbie Pink is recognized as a famous trademark of the brand.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re drawn to colors because they instantly convey various emotions, explained David Loranger, a professor of fashion merchandising and marketing at Sacred Heart University.\n\n\u201cI feel like having a direct line to the senses from a marketing standpoint is so important because it\u2019s a nonverbal, it\u2019s a semiotic vehicle,\u201d Loranger said. \u201cThe best marketing is very deeply rooted in emotion.\u201d\n\nBut from where do those innate emotional connections stem? It could come from something in nature, a belief system or something we\u2019ve been told.\n\n\u201cEvery color has meaning that we almost inherently sense from that color, whether we\u2019ve learned about it by association or just conditioning, which helps us to intuitively understand the message and the meaning that\u2019s delivered,\u201d Pressman said.\n\nWhen it comes to consumer marketing, the wide variance in pink\u2019s meanings means everyone can get in on the action. From high fashion \u2014 Valentino collaborated with Pantone and created a collection out of the resulting custom shade, shown on a pink runway last March \u2014 to everyday items, pink abounds.\n\nBrands now help shape our perception of color, and it pays to have a signature shade.\n\n\u201cColor can be an effective marketing tool. But more than I\u2019d say it\u2019s a bigger idea about claiming something, finding something new to talk about telling the consumer a story,\u201d Miguel said.\n\nEncased in pink, \u201cBarbie\u201d captures an artificial dreamland that instills nostalgia and joy, satisfying the audience\u2019s urge to escape.\n\n\u201cPeople are happy to find something that captures the imagination and transports them to somewhere simple, happy and fun,\u201d Miguel said, \u201cand pink is that.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalist Krysta Fauria contributed to this story."

    "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nRyan Gosling may or may not be your ideal Ken in the new \u201cBarbie\u201d movie, but one of the film\u2019s casting directors has shared who else might have gotten the role.\n\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair, Allison Jones \u2014 who cast the hit film along with Lucy Bevan \u2014 talked about who else might have joined Barbie in her dream house.\n\nLike the line of dolls the movie is based on, there are multiple Barbies and Kens portrayed by a diverse cast of actors.\n\nBut not everyone who wanted in was able to participate.\n\nAccording to Jones, Covid restrictions at the time meant having to spend three months in London where a great deal of the movie was filmed. And that meant Bowen Yang, Dan Levy, and Ben Platt were out of the running to play Ken.\n\n\u201cThey were, I\u2019m not kidding, really bummed they couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d she said.\n\nBen Platt, Bowen Yang and Dan Levy.

On the key Barbie and Ken roles, she got a very good idea of what an actor was like from talking to them.\u201d\n\nMargot Robbie snagged the main role of Barbie, though there are multiple other Barbies in the film played by a diverse group of actresses including Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae and Dua Lipa."

    "text": "If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement .\n\nGreta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie is finally upon us, and audiences love it. The comedy starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as the eponymous doll and her maybe-boyfriend Ken has made big money at the box office, with audiences and critics both effusively praising the film\u2019s extravagant production design and pitch-perfect soundtrack alongside Robbie\u2019s and Gosling\u2019s sensational performances.\n\nGreatness never occurs in a vacuum, and that goes especially for Gerwig\u2019s film. Speaking to Letterboxd prior to the film\u2019s premiere, the director cited over 30 movies that inspired her while working on the film, from musicals and fast-talking comedies starring Gene Kelly and Cary Grant to films directed by such cinematic icons as Federico Fellini, Stanley Kubrick, Jacques Demy, and Pedro Almod\u00f3var.\n\nIf you\u2019re aching for more Barbie-like entertainment, we\u2019ve pulled together a list of where you can stream or rent nearly all of the films Gerwig has cited as inspiration. Classics like A Matter of Life and Death, All That Jazz, and Oklahoma! are sadly unavailable online, but trust us \u2014 there\u2019s plenty here to keep you occupied.\n\nGold Diggers of 1935\n\nYear: 1935\n\nRun time: 1h 35m\n\nDirector: Busby Berkeley\n\nCast: Dick Powell, Adolphe Menjou, Gloria Stuart\n\nGerwig mentioned Gold Diggers of 1935 in the same breath as Fred Zinnemann\u2019s 1955 adaptation of the musical Oklahoma! as a film that most inspired her approach to filming dance sequences in Barbie. Gold Diggers of 1935 centers on the romantic antics of a group of guests at a luxurious resort hotel, among them an eccentric millionaire, a wealthy heiress, and a stage director. \u201c[The film] has this one really surreal dance number with a bunch of steps, Gerwig told Letterboxd. \u201cThere\u2019s, like, a million tap dancers that go through each other. It\u2019s kind of unreal.\u201d\n\nGold Diggers of 1935 is available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nYear: 1968\n\nRun time: 2h 29m\n\nDirector: Stanley Kubrick\n\nCast: Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, Douglas Rain\n\nStanley Kubrick\u2019s sci-fi opus has exerted a nigh monolithic (pun intended) influence over the medium of film and cinematic storytelling since it first landed in theaters in 1968. Among the film\u2019s most iconic moments are that of its first scene, wherein a tribe of hominins first encounter the alien artifact that seemingly grants them the power of intelligence. The influence on Barbie is obvious to anyone who has seen the first trailer for the film, wherein a group of young girls standing in a valley similar to the one seen in 2001: A Space Odyssey first encounters the doll that would change the history of children\u2019s toys forever.\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey is available to stream on Max, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nAn American in Paris\n\nYear: 1951\n\nRun time: 1h 54m\n\nDirector: Vincente Minnelli\n\nCast: Gene Kelly, Leslie Caron, Oscar Levant\n\nGerwig is a big fan of Gene Kelly. As she told Letterboxd, \u201cWhen I was growing up, Gene Kelly was my crush, which was weird.\u201d Not weird at all, Greta; after all, he\u2019s a canonical Hollywood dreamboat!\n\nGerwig singled out the opening scene, in which Jerry wakes up in his tiny apartment and gets ready for the day, as a inspiration. \u201cThere was something so satisfying about watching him go through his morning routine \u2014 that was one of the morning routines I loved. Even though Barbie has much more of an expanse, I was like, \u2018This is a great opening,\u2019\u201d Gerwig told Letterboxd. \u201cThen they have Leslie Caron in these very graphic, beautiful shots against an entirely purple room or an entirely green room; she\u2019s going through her day. It was these flourishes that were almost surreal in that film.\u201d\n\nAn American in Paris is available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nAnd the Ship Sails On\n\nYear: 1983\n\nRun time: 2h 8m\n\nDirector: Federico Fellini\n\nCast: Freddie Jones, Barbara Jefford, Victor Poletti\n\nFederico Fellini is not quite the first name you\u2019d think of as a possible inspiration for Barbie. The Italian filmmaker (and avid comic book fan) is one of the most influential directors of the 20th century, known for such eccentric and captivating masterpieces as La Strada, La Dolce Vita, and his 1963 magnum opus 8\u00bd. Gerwig cites Fellini\u2019s 1983 comedy-drama And the Ship Sails On as an inspiration for her approach to crafting the more surreal, practical effects of Barbie \u2014 in particular the fake sea effect as seen in Fellini\u2019s film.\n\nAnd the Ship Sails On is available to stream on Criterion Channel.\n\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind\n\nYear: 1977\n\nRun time: 2h 18m\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\n\nCast: Richard Dreyfuss, Teri Garr, Melinda Dillon\n\nGerwig cites Steven Spielberg\u2019s sci-fi drama as one of her favorite movies and a key inspiration for Barbie. Speaking to Letterboxd, she explained that the film is \u201cabout this maniacal belief in something that seemed sort of crazy, but was actually true.\u201d\n\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind is available to stream on Tubi and Pluto TV, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nGrease\n\nYear: 1978\n\nRun time: 1h 50m\n\nDirector: Randal Kleiser\n\nCast: John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, Stockard Channing\n\nBarbie owes a visible debt to the anachronistic flair of Grease, Randal Kleiser\u2019s classic romantic musical starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John. \u201cGrease is great,\u201d Gerwig told Letterboxd. \u201cIt\u2019s a musical about the 1950s, but made in the 1970s and everybody\u2019s 30. Love it.\u201d\n\nGrease is available to stream on Max, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nHeaven Can Wait\n\nYear: 1978\n\nRun time: 1h 41m\n\nDirector: Warren Beatty, Buck Henry\n\nCast: Warren Beatty, James Mason, Julie Christie\n\nIn between the fantastical music numbers and wacky set-pieces, Gerwig\u2019s Barbie is punctuated by genuine moments of existential questioning and despair. Heaven Can Wait, the 1978 drama directed by and starring Warren Beatty, was one of the films Gerwig looked to for inspiration in that regard. \u201cOne thing I love about Heaven Can Wait is it\u2019s extremely high concept, but it\u2019s always human,\u201d Gerwig told Letterboxd. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing about it that makes you feel distanced from it. It totally works, even though in some ways it seems sort of wacky, but when you\u2019re watching, it\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d\n\nHeaven Can Wait is available to stream on Pluto TV, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nHis Girl Friday\n\nYear: 1940\n\nRun time: 1h 32m\n\nDirector: Howard Hawks\n\nCast: Cary Grant, Rosalind Russell, Ralph Bellamy\n\nThe classic 1940 screwball comedy stars Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell as a formerly married newspaper editor and reporter who fall in love again while investigating the execution of a bookkeeper convicted of murder. His Girl Friday is one of the most iconic examples of the transatlantic accent, a distinctive fast-talking affect originated to imitate the hustle and bustle of upper-crust metropolitan elites. \u201cHis Girl Friday is one of the best fast-talking movies of all time,\u201d Gerwig told Letterboxd.\n\nHis Girl Friday is available to stream on Prime Video, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nModel Shop\n\nYear: 1969\n\nRun time: 1h 37m\n\nDirector: Jacques Demy\n\nCast: Anouk Aim\u00e9e, Gary Lockwood, Alexandra Hay\n\nGerwig lists not one, not two, but three Jacques Demy films as principal influences on Barbie. Demy\u2019s flair for carefully constructed worlds with an emphasis on bright colors and complementary costume choices is apparent in Gerwig\u2019s own approach to the pink-saturated wonderworld of Barbie and her friends.\n\nModel Shop is available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nModern Times\n\nYear: 1936\n\nRun time: 1h 27m\n\nDirector: Charlie Chaplin\n\nCast: Charlie Chaplin, Paulette Goddard, Henry Bergman\n\nCharlie Chaplin is the master of cinematic physical humor, a trait evident in nearly of all his films, though especially apparent in this 1936 satirical romance comedy. Barbie\u2019s various stunts and chase sequences owe a debt to the inspiration of Chaplin\u2019s character The Tramp, as Gerwig tells Letterboxd in her interview.\n\nModern Times is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel.\n\nMon Oncle\n\nYear: 1958\n\nRun time: 2h 35m\n\nDirector: Jacques Tati\n\nCast: Jacques Tati, Jean-Pierre Zola, Adrienne Servantie\n\nJacques Tati is a master of environmental comedy, known for his elaborately constructed set-pieces that foreground the delightfully clashing personalities of his characters while mischievously critiquing the absurdity of modern society. \u201cJacques Tati is the king of the slow joke,\u201d Gerwig told Letterboxd. \u201cThe way those movies unfold are just so perfect. I always thought of Mattel as existing slightly in Jacques Tati\u2019s world.\u201d\n\nMon Oncle is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel.\n\nPee-wee\u2019s Big Adventure\n\nYear: 1985\n\nRun time: 1h 30m\n\nDirector: Tim Burton\n\nCast: Paul Reubens, E.G. Daily, Mark Holton\n\nTim Burton\u2019s feature-length adaptation of Paul Reubens\u2019 iconic children\u2019s TV character heavily inspired the fantastical set-pieces and comedic rhythm of Gerwig\u2019s own Barbie. \u201cThere\u2019s that section where he gets on a train and is a tramp on a train and sings songs, then he gets bored of it and falls off the train and it takes 60 seconds,\u201d Gerwig told Letterboxd. \u201cIt\u2019s hilarious, but it\u2019s just a really short thing.\u201d\n\nPee-Wee\u2019s Big Adventure is available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nPlaytime\n\nYear: 1967\n\nRun time: 1h 55m\n\nDirector: Jacques Tati\n\nCast: Jacques Tati, Barbara Dennek, Rita Maiden\n\nAs mentioned previously, Tati\u2019s work was a major inspiration for Gerwig\u2019s Barbie. Playtime is often cited as Tati\u2019s magnum opus, following the director\u2019s bumbling protagonist Monsieur Hulot (played by Tati himself) as he wanders throughout a modern Parisian cityscape cramped with a dioramic assortment of hilarious and strange set-pieces.\n\nPlaytime is available to stream on Criterion Channel, or available to rent on Amazon and Apple.\n\nRear Window\n\nYear: 1954\n\nRun time: 1h 52m\n\nDirector: Alfred Hitchcock\n\nCast: James Stewart, Grace Kelly, Wendell Corey\n\nAlfred Hitchcock\u2019s mystery-thriller about a photographer in a wheelchair who may or may not have witnessed the murder of one of his neighbors in his apartment block is not only one of the director\u2019s most iconic and oft-imitated films, but a surprising influence on Barbie. In her interview with Letterboxd, Gerwig cited the practical construction of the film\u2019s sets and backgrounds as an inspiration while working on her own film.\n\nRear Window is available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nSaturday Night Fever\n\nYear: 1977\n\nRun time: 1h 59m\n\nDirector: John Badham\n\nCast: John Travolta, Karen Lynn Gorney, Barry Miller\n\nBarbie is a lot of things: not quite a musical and not quite a drama, but a mish-mash of several different genres with a heavy emphasis on music. Gerwig cites Saturday Night Fever as an influence on her vision for Barbie as a movie supported by an amazing soundtrack. \u201cSaturday Night Fever obviously has this incredible soundtrack by the Bee Gees. [...] I thought Barbie seemed so disco to me in her heart, because Barbie\u2019s sort of \u2014 and I will say this as a lover of Barbie and disco \u2014 a little bit dorky in the best way,\u201d Gerwig told Letterboxd. \u201cSaturday Night Fever was a movie that was driven by music, but not a musical. I guess we\u2019re half of a musical.\u201d\n\nSaturday Night Fever is available to stream on Prime Video and Paramount Plus, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nSingin\u2019 in the Rain\n\nYear: 1952\n\nRun time: 1h 43m\n\nDirector: Stanley Donen, Gene Kelly\n\nCast: Gene Kelly, Donald O\u2019Connor, Debbie Reynolds\n\nGerwig cites Singin\u2019 in the Rain as not just one of her favorite movies, but her very favorite. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that the film would have an abundant influence on her work on Barbie. \u201cThere are so many great things in Singin\u2019 in the Rain, but the dream ballet inside of the dream ballet is one of the most incredible, beautiful, completely unhinged things.\u201d\n\nSingin\u2019 in the Rain is available to stream on Max, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nSplash\n\nYear: 1984\n\nRun time: 1h 51m\n\nDirector: Ron Howard\n\nCast: Tom Hanks, Daryl Hannah, Eugene Levy\n\n\u201cSplash is another movie that is utterly charming and works emotionally, even though it\u2019s so high concept and it\u2019s down to Daryl Hannah and Tom Hanks, who are so great,\u201d Gerwig told Letterboxd. \u201cI\u2019m sure the tagline was, like, \u2018Fish Out of Water.\u2019 It felt like a crossing-worlds movie\u2026 It\u2019s one I\u2019ve loved since I was a kid, too.\u201d\n\nSplash is available to stream on Disney Plus and MGM Plus, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nThe Earrings of Madame de\u2026\n\nYear: 1953\n\nRun time: 1h 45m\n\nDirector: Max Oph\u00fcls\n\nCast: Charles Boyer, Danielle Darrieux, Vittorio De Sica\n\nGerwig cites Max Oph\u00fcls\u2019 1953 romantic drama film as an inspiration on Barbie for its beautiful camerawork. \u201cI mean, I can\u2019t believe some of those shots. They\u2019re just extraordinary; it\u2019s always a reminder of what we\u2019re all going for.\u201d\n\nThe Earrings of Madame de\u2026 is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel, or available to rent on Amazon and Apple.\n\nThe Godfather\n\nYear: 1972\n\nRun time: 2h 55m\n\nDirector: Francis Ford Coppola\n\nCast: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola\u2019s crime drama masterpiece is one of the most celebrated films of the 20th century, so it\u2019s only natural that Gerwig would find a way to fit a nod to The Godfather in her work on Barbie. If you know, you know.\n\nThe Godfather is available to stream on Paramount Plus, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nThe Ladies Man\n\nYear: 1961\n\nRun time: 1h 35m\n\nDirector: Jerry Lewis\n\nCast: Jerry Lewis, Helen Traubel, Pat Stanley\n\nJerry Lewis\u2019 1961 comedy about a man who takes up a job at a women-only boarding house after breaking up with his girlfriend is a key influence on Gerwig\u2019s Barbie, particularly in its diorama approach to set design and iconic opening moments. \u201cThey built this house that was cut out, and then they moved around the rooms with a camera in this one continuous shot with all these girls getting ready,\u201d Gerwig told Letterboxd. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible. That\u2019s where I got the idea for the mirror that has nothing in it that you look through, and it\u2019s just her.\u201d\n\nThe Ladies Man is available to stream on Showtime, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nThe Philadelphia Story\n\nYear: 1940\n\nRun time: 1h 52m\n\nDirector: George Cukor\n\nCast: Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart\n\nGerwig cited the 1940 comedy The Philadelphia Story as an influence on Barbie, not just for her love of Cary Grant, but as a inspiration for Margot Robbie\u2019s portrayal of Barbie. \u201cOne of the reasons I loved it \u2014 and I said to Margot to watch it for Barbie because Katharine Hepburn describes herself as being a Grecian statue or something \u2014 is she\u2019s unflappable and then she starts falling apart, and that\u2019s actually where she finds herself,\u201d Gerwig told Letterboxd. \u201cIt was actually already one of Margot\u2019s favorite movies; she already had that in her back pocket, as it were.\u201d\n\nThe Philadelphia Story is available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nThe Red Shoes\n\nYear: 1948\n\nRun time: 2h 15m\n\nDirector: Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger\n\nCast: Anton Walbrook, Marius Goring, Moira Shearer\n\nThe 1948 British drama about a ballerina who is forced to choose between her love for her career and her love for a composer is a dominant inspiration for Gerwig\u2019s Barbie. \u201cThe Red Shoes [is] all over the movie. There\u2019s a shot of her walking up to that house, which I wanted it to feel like that when Barbie walks up to [Weird Barbie\u2019s] house. Ryan Gosling wears a pair of glasses that are the cat-eye glasses that the director wears in it, because I was like, \u2018How stylish and bold that that man\u2019s wearing cat-eye glasses \u2014 it\u2019s so fun.\u2019 Then Ryan was like, \u2018Can I wear cat-eye glasses?\u2019 and I was like, \u2018You definitely can,\u2019 and then he had two on.\u201d\n\nThe Red Shoes is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel, or available to rent on Amazon and Apple.\n\nThe Truman Show\n\nYear: 1998\n\nRun time: 1h 43m\n\nDirector: Peter Weir\n\nCast: Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich\n\nPeter Weir\u2019s contemporary existential comedy about a man who discovers that his entire life has been a carefully orchestrated \u201creality\u201d TV show shares a lot in common with the spirit of Gerwig\u2019s Barbie. \u201cI had to include The Truman Show both because I watched it again before I made this movie, and because Peter Weir very generously got on the phone with me before I started shooting, and he talked to me for a long time about how he shot it and how they made it work.\u201d\n\nThe Truman Show is available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg\n\nYear: 1964\n\nRun time: 1h 31m\n\nDirector: Jacques Demy\n\nCast: Catherine Deneuve, Anne Vernon, Nino Castelnuovo\n\nAs mentioned previously, Jacques Demy was a huge influence on the production design of Gerwig\u2019s Barbie. \u201cThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg [is] an amazing movie and astonishingly beautiful,\u201d Gerwig told Letterboxd. \u201cI loved the use of color and the surrealness. Rodrigo Prieto and I \u2014 he shot the film and he\u2019s one of the greatest DPs who ever lived \u2014 were talking about that layering of the colors and how you\u2019d shoot five different shades of pink or red in one shot and not have it overwhelm anything, that you feel like there\u2019s separation, but that it\u2019s vibrant. Everything feels painterly, and that was a big part of it.\u201d\n\nThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel, or available to rent on Amazon and Apple.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\nYear: 1939\n\nRun time: 1h 42m\n\nDirector: Victor Fleming\n\nCast: Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger\n\nThe iconic 1939 musical fantasy starring Judy Garland is an obvious inspiration for Gerwig\u2019s film about a girl transported to a world beyond her imagination. \u201cIn our movie, we have the Pink Brick Road instead of the Yellow Brick Road,\u201d Gerwig told Letterboxd. \u201cWe also have beautiful painted backdrops of horizons. We executed it like they would\u2019ve done in the \u201930s and \u201940s and \u201950s soundstage musicals. It was something that we kept returning to. I always love the ending where there\u2019s a ceremonial quality.\u201d\n\nThe Wizard of Oz is available to stream on Max, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nThe Young Girls of Rochefort\n\nYear: 1967\n\nRun time: 2h 5m\n\nDirector: Jacques Demy\n\nCast: Catherine Deneuve, George Chakiris, Fran\u00e7oise Dorl\u00e9ac\n\nJacques Demy\u2019s musical comedy about two extravagantly dressed sisters pining for love was a key influence on Gerwig\u2019s Barbie, particularly for the film\u2019s many flamboyant costume designs. At one point in the film, Barbie sports a hat similar to the sisters\u2019 own.\n\nThe Young Girls of Rochefort is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nTwentieth Century\n\nYear: 1934\n\nRun time: 1h 31m\n\nDirector: Howard Hawks\n\nCast: John Barrymore, Carole Lombard, Walter Connolly\n\nGerwig cites Howard Hawks\u2019 screwball romance Twentieth Century as an influence on Barbie\u2019s heightened sense of emotion-driven comedy. \u201cMargot reminds me of Carole Lombard and Ryan reminds me of John Barrymore in how funny he is. There are scenes where they\u2019re just screaming at each other; I was like, \u2018This is perfect.\u2019 There\u2019s a heightened, dramatic thing that John Barrymore does that I showed to Ryan, then he took that and put it in our movie.\u201d\n\nTwentieth Century is available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nWings of Desire\n\nYear: 1987\n\nRun time: 2h 8m\n\nDirector: Wim Wenders\n\nCast: Bruno Ganz, Solveig Dommartin, Otto Sander\n\nAmong the wide breadth of Gerwig\u2019s inspirations, Wings of Desire might feel like the oddest film to cite as an inspiration for Barbie. It\u2019s a romantic fantasy about an angel that falls in love with a trapeze artist and renounces his immortality in order to spend the rest of his existence on Earth with her, and Gerwig describes the film as an influence for the simple fact that it features conversations with an angel \u2014 and that\u2019s it!\n\nWings of Desire is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel, or available to rent on Amazon and Apple.\n\nWomen on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown\n\nYear: 1988\n\nRun time: 1h 28m\n\nDirector: Pedro Almod\u00f3var\n\nCast: Carmen Maura, Antonio Banderas, Julieta Serrano\n\nPedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s 1988 black comedy about a television actress who embarks on a journey of self-discovery in order to get to the heart of why her lover left her is commonly referred to as one of the director\u2019s best. In the case of Gerwig\u2019s Barbie, the film was an inspiration for its distinctive set design and method of layering colors on screen.\n\nWomen on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown is available to stream on Freevee, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu."

    "text": "It's a Barbie girl summer for economists, too.\n\nMattel's (MAT) famous doll has been everywhere this summer, dominating the box office with the best opening weekend of 2023 and even getting a mention in the Federal Reserve's latest press conference.\n\nBut the story of Barbie's intersection with finance news is about more than the industry's most prominent purple-tied official Jay Powell answering a question about pink attire and Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, because both are proving to be legitimate drivers of a resilient US consumer keeping America out of a recession.\n\n\"These events are getting more highlighted specifically because of the situation we're looking at,\" Bank of America US economist Shruti Mishra told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"Is the consumer going to drop? Is it still resilient? Those questions are the most important questions leading up to any Fed press conference, FOMC meeting, and just generally for the economic outlook.\"\n\nFed Chair Powell, for his part, didn't fully bite last week when asked about the impact of Barbie and Taylor Swift on the US economy. But even he noted it doesn't hurt.\n\n\"The overall resilience of the economy, the fact that we've been able to achieve disinflation so far without any meaningful negative impact on the labor market, the strength of the economy overall, that's a good thing,\" Powell said.\n\n\"It's good to see that, of course. It's also you see consumer confidence coming up and things like that, that will support activity going forward.\"\n\nMargot Robbie attends the European premiere of \"Barbie\" in London, Britain July 12, 2023. (Maja Smiejkowska/REUTERS) (Maja Smiejkowska / reuters)\n\nAnd these aren't just any popular summer events, either.\n\nReports have estimated Swift's Eras Tour could be the first billion-dollar concert tour ever.\n\nMeanwhile, \"Barbenheimer\" \u2014 the dual box office hits of \"Barbie\" and Christopher Nolan's biopic \"Oppenheimer\" \u2014 combined for the fourth-biggest overall weekend in box office history.\n\nIn the latest release of the Fed's Beige Book, the Philadelphia Fed highlighted Taylor Swift's three-night stop at Lincoln Financial Field as a boost to the local economy.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaylor Swift performs onstage during the Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour at Lincoln Financial Field on May 12, 2023 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (Lisa Lake/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management) (Lisa Lake/TAS23 via Getty Images)\n\n\"Multiple contacts reported that the amount of money guests spend at their leisure destinations declined modestly in recent months,\" the report read.\n\n\"Despite the slowing recovery in tourism in the region overall, one contact highlighted that May was the strongest month for hotel revenue in Philadelphia since the onset of the pandemic, in large part due to an influx of guests for the Taylor Swift concerts in the city.\"\n\nAnalysis from Moody's shows Swift's impact wasn't just a one-off in Philadelphia, either.\n\nMoody's had seen an increase in revenue per available room in every city Swift has stopped in that the firm tracks through its report's publication July 21.\n\nMoody's tracked average revenue per room increases at all four of the cities Taylor Swift stopped at in May. (Moody's Analytics)\n\nAccording to University of Michigan clinical assistant professor of marketing Marcus Collins, it's rare for a movie and concert tour to have this kind of impact.\n\nWith Barbie pink taking over wardrobes and Swift's Eras Tour bracelets dominating social media, the marketing behind both messages have transcended into a cultural moment. And culture, Collins told Yahoo Finance, is the \"most influential external force of human behavior, full stop.\"\n\n\"The salience of (Barbie and the Eras Tour) makes it so that it's undeniable,\" Collins said. \"You can't not talk about it because it's everywhere.\"\n\nJefferies US economist Thomas Simons told Yahoo Finance he hasn't seen anything like the obsession with Barbie and Taylor Swift in his more than 15 years working in economic research.\n\nSimons likens the interest from economists to the rise of social media and the \"casualization\" of economics, which leads to economists being both more aware of pop culture impacts and more willing to look for them.\n\nAnd as economists and researchers alike have turned to the data to look for the impact of these cultural phenomena, the answers have been eye-popping.\n\nIn addition to the findings from Moody's and the Fed, recent data from Bank of America showed card spending on entertainment and clothing both spiked the week of Barbie's release with entertainment sales up about 13%.\n\n\"There's (likely) a Barbie and Oppenheimer effect to play out here,\" Mishra noted.\n\nBank of America saw an increase in card spending the week Barbie and Oppenheimer were released.

    "text": "For some time now, and until further notice, pink means Barbie, whether it\u2019s really about Barbie or not. Ever since the movie about Mattel\u2019s most iconic toy doll began its impressive advertising campaign, the world has been flooded in waves of pink \u2014 a tide that has managed to swamp more than just the land of cinema. In the span of merely a few months, we have witnessed the #Barbiecore trend on Tik-Tok, with users creating their own Barbie-inspired outfits and pink-themed aesthetics, and pink-carpet photoshoots taking place around the world with celebrities ransacking the vintage archives of major fashion houses to dress in the spirit of the famous doll. Scores of adoring fans have dug up their most chic and beloved garments from childhood \u2014 pink outfits abandoned in adolescence and rediscovered thanks to Barbie \u2014 eagerly consuming the advertisements and products launched by Mattel and collaborators, like Barbie lipstick and Ken underwear. And on top of all the pop culture hullabaloo, Barbie has entered the world of politics too: while the right criticizes her for promoting a \u201cwoke agenda,\u201d liberals and leftists like Spain\u2019s Second Deputy Prime Minister Yolanda D\u00edaz are flocking to the film and sharing their enthusiasm for Barbie\u2019s feminist agenda on social media.\n\n\u201cColors are fundamental in marketing and advertising because they\u2019re a very powerful tool for conveying emotions and improving brand recognition,\u201d explains Bego Romero, a digital marketing consultant whose personal website also features pink as the dominant color. \u201cPink is associated with femininity, sweetness, softness, delicacy, but it\u2019s also true that now, thanks to an excellent marketing campaign that has made the brand very memorable, the image of Barbie pink has emerged, which we immediately associate with the doll. When someone says \u2018I bought a Barbie-pink bag\u2019 and you immediately know exactly which tone it is, it speaks to this very strong brand identity, which also expresses an emotional connection: the color will always remind us of childhood,\u201d she says.\n\nProtected by its semantic field of softness and childishness, cushioning its connotations, Barbie pink is also an intense, vibrant and striking color that suggests vitality and passion, and that somehow has become \u2014 thanks to the doll, which has always reflected the socio-cultural trends of the time \u2014 a signifier of feminine character and strength, a banner of girlboss feminism and, in corporate contexts, a sign of the commitment of brands to liberal progress and social justice. This perception, which implies a tension between continuity (of gender roles, for example) and subversion is also found within, and in the very concept of, Barbie the movie.\n\nThree young girls (Sophie, Ayan and Mia) dressed in pink at the premiere of 'Barbie' in L.A. Jenna Schoenefeld (The Washington Post via Getty Im)\n\nSpeaking to The New Yorker\u2019s Alex Barasch, Greta Gerwig described the sensation of entering Mattel\u2019s headquarters for the first time: It was like the company had shattered, at least cosmetically, her mental image of what a corporation should be (instead of dull and gray, everything was \u201cbright pink\u201d and \u201cvery cinematic,\u201d she said). And indeed, many of today\u2019s films and cultural products are now manufactured under a new corporate logic and aesthetic that is more chic and feminine \u2014 two qualities practically imprinted on Barbie\u2019s DNA.\n\nPink invites subversion and the breaking of certain corporate conventions, and perhaps even the exploration of excluded identities or inhibitions. But what does this get us, other than a parallel corporate world in pink? \u201cIn this sense, Barbie the film is nothing more than a way to revitalize Barbie the doll, to make a marketing niche for her in the post-MeToo liberal feminist world,\u201d argues Pablo Caldera, a Spanish cultural critic. \u201cThat other companies, like [fashion retailer] Zara, would take advantage of these same cultural codes seems, to me, a natural step. The film itself inhabits this same world of extreme corporatism, erasing or neutralizing any potential power it might have had to inspire spontaneous or collective forms of association.\u201d\n\nThe pink flood that is sweeping so many of us up is propelled by two main driving forces: nostalgia and virality. Mattel CEO Ynon Kreitz\u2019s stated goal, for the medium term, is to transform the company from a toy manufacturer into a franchise management company \u2014 a \u201cpop culture\u201d company. In addition to Barbie, Mattel has announced fourteen other films (Lena Dunham is working on Polly Pocket; J.J. Abrams on Hot Wheels) and 45 more are in \u201cdevelopment.\u201d In today\u2019s Hollywood of endless franchises, more and more companies want to play; it\u2019s no longer about making toys and spin-offs from popular movies, but about making movies about pre-existing products. This year alone, we had Ben Affleck\u2019s Air, about the Air Jordan basketball shoe line, and Eva Longoria\u2019s Flamin\u2019 Hot, the origin story of Spicy Cheetos. \u201cPeople are always going to trust and be drawn to things they\u2019re familiar with,\u201d Romero explains. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing with Barbie, and what Hollywood does in general, is playing with people\u2019s emotions: if a consumer has had a good relationship or meaningful experience with a brand, it\u2019s going to be easier for them to want to consume a new version of that same product.\u201d\n\nThe Barbie brand is not the first to transcend the realm of cinema and become a world unto itself, but unlike other cult films, where the collective experience becomes more important than the film itself (such as the 1978 The Rocky Horror Picture Show, where theater-goers go to sing and throw popcorn), Barbie\u2019s popularity preceded the film. In the case of Mean Girls (2004), fans also wore pink (a pink that, incidentally, served to point out the dangers of confusing substance with form; the hypocrisy of the film\u2019s worst protagonists dressed in the sweetest of colors). But in the case of Barbie, fans wear pink to signal our membership in the marketing campaign; what mobilizes us to dress in uniform is the decades-long work of building a magnetic brand identity. It\u2019s popular culture, but a completely manufactured one.\n\nMu\u00f1ecas de Barbie expuestas durante la semana de la moda de Nueva York en febrero de 2009. TIMOTHY A. CLARY (AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, it seems like a positive development that we\u2019re returning to the question of cinema as a social phenomenon that requires codes of intelligibility that are relatively transparent,\u201d Caldera says. \u201cBut it\u2019s also true that something as seemingly benign and casual as the leaking of photos from the film\u2019s shooting, the successive trailers promoting the release, and the exploitation of memes, which are an inherently collective force, are all the result of an extreme form of corporatism, with Marvel being the only other parallel.\u201d For Romero, Barbie\u2019s marketing campaign is one of the best he has seen in recent years: \u201cThey\u2019ve managed to combine absolutely everything,\u201d she said.\n\nBarbie\u2019s maximalism permeates both its forms and objectives. From its early stages of conception, the film was conceived as something that would please everyone (or as many people as possible): \u201cIf you love Barbie\u2026 if you hate Barbie, this movie is for you,\u201d is one of the advertising slogans. This is made all the more evident by the fact that Barbie\u2019s character arc is ultimately less important than Ken\u2019s. The film may have become a social phenomenon, but at its core, it has always and above all been an advertising phenomenon \u2014 something that necessarily had to result from compromises between the creative team and Mattel\u2019s corporate representatives. \u201cIt\u2019s very interesting, and something you notice when watching the film, because you can clearly see the limits that have been set by the corporation,\u201d Caldera says. \u201cIn the beginning, the film plays around with subverting its own origins (\u2018feminism\u2019 and \u2018Mattel\u2019 are mentioned within the first few minutes), but it\u2019s all part of a directed and ultimately homogeneous production. Not taking full advantage of Will Ferrell\u2019s character [a Mattel executive] can only be explained by the film\u2019s own lack of creative and political autonomy from the corporate franchise. It\u2019s as if they were only allowed certain themes, certain jokes, and were prohibited from going too far, from making it into a parody.\u201d\n\nA Zara store's display window shows a Barbie-inspired line of clothing and accessories. SOPA Images (SOPA Images/LightRocket via Gett)\n\nIndeed, Mattel\u2019s CEO has admitted as much, explaining that if the movie had ridiculed Barbie, it would have been disastrous for the brand. \u201cBarbie is aspirational, inspirational \u2014 not something you want turned into a parody,\u201d Kreiz told The New Yorker. This is why the company \u2014 which in 1997 went so far as to sue M.C.A. Records over Aqua\u2019s song \u201cBarbie Girl,\u201d which nevertheless appears in the film\u2019s trailer \u2014 scrapped an earlier proposal for a Barbie movie starring comedian Amy Schumer. The corporation didn\u2019t want satire: \u201cI think the film goes for a soft critique, which is always welcome and necessary, but ultimately it ends up reinforcing the power and updating the image of the company behind it,\u201d Caldera argues.\n\nIn the movie, and despite some initial protests from Mattel\u2019s executives, Gerwig plucks certain failed moments out of the dustbin of the doll\u2019s history, to show that Barbie is not some rigid, conservative monolith, but a fluid and constantly changing signifier. Perhaps, however, in this process of showing, there is also an element of erasure. Hollywood knows that gentle satire is the best way to whitewash (or, should we say, pinkwash) certain trends in cinema with obvious corporate ends, and the implications go well beyond Barbie. Gerwig herself has stated several times that her aspiration is not to become the best director in the world, but to be a great studio director.\n\n\u201cI think this film will put an end to Gerwig\u2019s reputation in independent cinema,\u201d says Caldera, who also points to another crucial issue: \u201cThe coincidence of the film\u2019s release with Hollywood\u2019s actors and screenwriters going on strike seems to me a historic opportunity to think collectively about this particular mode of production, which distracts the viewer\u2019s attention and has dominated the discourse from the moment the premiere was announced. It\u2019s not even a spectacle anymore, I don\u2019t think there is even any collective pleasure, just the need to give a nod to the revitalization of certain discourses that we thought we had forgotten. In that sense, Barbie is as nostalgic as any other blockbuster released in 2023, unfortunately. The insistence on generational transference in the film leads to this neutralizing of more radical discourses.\u201d\n\nBarbie dolls inside their characteristic boxes at an auction in London in 2006. Chris Jackson (Getty Images)\n\nHistory in pink\n\nA very important and often forgotten feature of the color pink, explained by Lynn Peril in her book Pink Think: Becoming a Woman in Many Uneasy Lessons, is its power of concealment. While it is often said that pink has always been associated with femininity \u2014 and despite the amusing coincidence that the first cultural phenomenon to draw a clear relationship between pink and being a girl was Louisa May Alcott\u2019s 1869 novel Little Women, which Gerwig adapted to film in 2019 \u2014 the truth is that it was not until the end of World War II that the color became popular among American women as a sign of returning to a lost domesticity. It was during this era that the first lady of the United States, Mamie Eisenhower, would adopt pink as her signature color, to convey the message that women could hang up their factory overalls, return to the home, and resume their traditional role.\n\nWith Mrs. Eisenhower as its model, the marketing industry began filling American homes with pink. Later, the actress Jayne Mansfield would take the trend to ultimate heights, building a pink palace with a pink Jacuzzi, getting married in a pink wedding dress, dying her dogs pink, and thoroughly consolidating the association between the color and notions of innocuous, obedient femininity. The truth, however, is that even Mansfield herself did not have a genuine connection with pink: she chose the color because she needed a brand of her own, and because she knew it would make her less threatening to her male competitors. The color soon revealed itself as a tool \u2014 a way, for example, of appearing more innocent than one truly was. Perhaps this is why pink is now the color of pop culture, and also a tool for filmmakers, like John Waters or Kenneth Anger, who want to subvert the color\u2019s connotations and point to its hidden meanings. In cinema, too, a somewhat darker, more perverse and more interesting story can be drawn from the color pink \u2014 the color that hides as much as it shows.\n\nToday, Barbie is washing everything in pink, from social media to store windows, and more than 100 brands are now involved in the production of various absurd, Barbie-themed objects. In Los Angeles, pink Barbie benches have appeared overnight, complete with built-in anti-sleeping dividers to prevent the city\u2019s homeless from using them to rest. Recently, someone on Twitter summed up the situation succinctly: \u201cHeart-warming: this hostile architecture is pink.\u201d"

    "text": "For thirty-five years, I was at the center of the Barbie universe as a member of Mattel\u2019s design team. It wasn\u2019t a career I had ever envisioned when I was younger, but from that moment in 1962 when I first read Mattel\u2019s advertisement in Women\u2019s Wear Daily, I saw my future, and it thrilled me.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s because Barbie\u2019s life was the polar opposite of my own: she was the ultimate California girl, while I grew up in Minneapolis, where the winters were gray and seemingly endless. Barbie could take on any profession she desired\u2014she was an astronaut in 1965, four years before the Apollo 11 moon landing\u2014but when I was thinking about a career in the late 1950s, the options available to women largely focused on the \u201cexpected\u201d five: nurse, teacher, secretary, shopgirl, and seamstress. I always knew that I wanted more.\n\nOne Sunday while reading the newspaper, I spied an ad for a seminar highlighting jobs in the fashion industry. I put on my best interview clothes and my bravest face, and I didn\u2019t tell anyone where I was going. The first speaker was a member of the Fashion Group International, Inc., who discussed the fashion design program at the Minneapolis School of Art. She put two words together that I had never heard of as a vocation: fashion designer. It was as though someone had turned on a light. Before leaving the seminar, I filled out an application\u2014and when I returned home, I still didn\u2019t tell anyone.\n\nI watched the mailbox every day for weeks until an envelope with my name on it finally arrived: I had been accepted! That feeling of wanting more suddenly no longer made me feel restless; instead, it was exhilarating.\n\nToday the Minneapolis School of Art is known as the Minneapolis College of Art and Design, and in the early 1950s, I was among just 250 students, many of whom were World War II veterans studying on the GI Bill. On most days, I was able to catch a ride with a former GI who decided to study sculpture after he had worked on the restoration of Mount Rushmore. And instead of the sweater-and-skirt combination that had practically become my high school uniform, in college I wore blue jeans most days\u2014just like the guys.\n\nAt the beginning of my senior year of college, a notice was posted that the application process was about to kick off for Mademoiselle magazine\u2019s annual guest-editor contest. While Vogue was considered the epitome of high fashion, Mademoiselle focused more on the lifestyle of smart, independent young women; contributing authors included Joyce Carol Oates and Truman Capote. Meanwhile, the guest-editor program was truly prestigious, with an alumni list that included Sylvia Plath and, from my year, Joan Didion.\n\nEntrants submitted four essays over the course of their senior year; but with more than thirty-seven thousand applicants and only twenty guest editor spaces, did I even have a chance? My first essay won a ten-dollar prize, and I allowed myself to hope. In early May, just prior to graduation, the telegram arrived: \u201cWe are delighted to tell you that you have been chosen as a 1955 Guest Editor.\u201d\n\nIn June 1955, instead of walking across the stage to receive my diploma, I\u2019d checked into the legendary Barbizon Hotel for Women in New York City, living and working in a city that was overwhelming, but exciting too. While walking on Fifth Avenue, I found myself always looking up\u2014at the green mansard rooftops of the Pierre and the Plaza, or the art deco edifices of Bonwit Teller and Tiffany & Co.\n\nOur class of twenty talented \u201cmademoiselles\u201d was nothing less than a dreamlike experience. We were invited everywhere: to the home of the famed cosmetics mogul Helena Rubinstein, who devoted an entire room of her penthouse apartment to Salvador Dal\u00ed paintings, and to stand at the podium in the General Assembly room at the United Nations, which had opened its headquarters on Manhattan\u2019s East Side just a few years before. We wore our best formals while dancing with West Point cadets in the ballroom on the rooftop of the St. Regis Hotel. And everywhere we went, we were photographed as though we were debutantes or celebrities. It was about as far from Minneapolis as you could get.\n\nEven the work was tinged with glamor. We each had to produce an article for publication, and I asked the magazine\u2019s fashion editor, Kay Silver, if I could interview Pauline Trig\u00e8re, whose work I appreciated for its combination of innovative construction and clean, chic lines. To my utter delight, Kay granted my wish, and soon enough I was standing with Pauline Trig\u00e8re in her workroom in the Garment District. It was my first look at a professional design studio, with its large tables for pattern cutting, mannequins for draping (Miss Trig\u00e8re\u2019s preferred design process), and a live-fit model on standby. I was hooked.\n\nDuring our interview, Miss Trig\u00e8re (as I always called her) dispensed terrific advice that I still follow: a pretty sketch is only the beginning; a good fashion designer also considers the execution of that design and how the personality of the fabric will play a role. No one element is more important than the others. She also encouraged me to, above all, be true to myself. Throughout my thirty-five years designing for Barbie, I never strayed from this philosophy.\n\nAfter my month in New York, I spent a few years designing first children\u2019s clothing, then \u201cmisses sportswear\u201d (the designation for teenage girls then).\n\nWhen I saw the ad in Women\u2019s Wear Daily in November 1962, it didn\u2019t mention Barbie or Mattel; rather, it was a blind ad for a fashion designer stylist, yet I read between the lines and was able to discern both the company and product. Perhaps best of all, two words jumped out at me: Los Angeles. Sunny California suddenly seemed like the perfect change from Milwaukee, and working on Barbie, already the world\u2019s most popular toy, seemed like an irresistible idea. I sent my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for consideration, but didn\u2019t receive a response.\n\nIn the meantime, thoughts of Los Angeles continued to beckon. One day, in a pure leap of faith, I decided a move to California was exactly the change I was seeking. I didn\u2019t have a job, but even if Mattel didn\u2019t hire me, I knew Los Angeles was a hub for fashion manufacturers.\n\nBefore I left Milwaukee, I had asked for my mail to be forwarded, but still no word from the company advertising for a fashion designer-stylist. Then one day in 1963, I was sitting at my kitchen table in Los Angeles, reading a trade paper, and I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes: \u201cBarbie Needs a Fashion Designer-Stylist.\u201d The ad listed all the same requirements as the previous blind ad, but this time it was no secret: Mattel needed someone to design for Barbie. Thrilled to learn more about the position, and that it hadn\u2019t been filled, I applied the same day.\n\nAnd soon enough, a response. Actually, make that two responses: At roughly the same time Mattel replied to my submission to the ad in the California paper, my forwarded mail from Milwaukee also arrived, and there was Mattel\u2019s reply to the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 I had sent after seeing the blind ad in Women\u2019s Wear Daily. Amazingly, both letters included the same request: Could I come in for an interview on April 12 at 11:00 a.m.?\n\nThis was fate, I thought. My decision to move to Los Angeles had paid off.\n\nOn Friday, April 12, 1963, just before 11:00 a.m., I arrived for my interview at Mattel\u2019s California headquarters. I was determined to get this job.\n\nI had two weeks to create a set of test fashions; the dolls should be dressed in my finished designs.\n\nMy interview with Jerry Fire of Mattel\u2019s human resources department was quite brief. He had heard the story of my dueling r\u00e9sum\u00e9 submissions, and during this process Mattel evidently had decided I was more than qualified for the job. There were just two hurdles to get past: from that same desk drawer, Jerry took out two Barbie dolls, one blond and the other brunette, both sporting the same bubble-cut hairstyle. With them, he handed me a packet of instructions. I had two weeks to create a set of test fashions; the dolls should be dressed in my finished designs, and I needed to present patterns and sketches. \u201cAnd be sure to keep track of your time, because we\u2019ll pay you for it,\u201d Jerry added.\n\nBack in my apartment, I put the dolls on my kitchen table and spread out the instructions. The first challenge was how different it would be to design for a doll instead of designing for a child or young woman. Barbie had been created on a onesixth scale of the female form, and while the math for creating patterns was easy enough, finding prints suitable for her smaller size could be difficult; even the smallest, most delicate flower on a child\u2019s dress would seem gigantic on an eleven-and-a-half-inch doll. I also had to take into consideration the perception of Barbie as the quintessential California girl. Whatever I designed needed to evoke that ideal.\n\nCompleting the test fashions was merely the first hurdle. My follow-up meeting two weeks later was with the woman who already had become a bona fide legend in the history of Barbie. Charlotte Johnson had been a freelance fashion designer who also taught at what later became known as the California Institute of Arts.\n\nEarly in 1959, Ruth Handler recruited Charlotte to work on her top secret doll project, and she ultimately played an integral role in Barbie\u2019s look. Charlotte was inspired by the runways of Paris and New York, combining that chic aesthetic with the feeling of the California lifestyle to create the twenty-two fashions that comprised Barbie\u2019s 1959 debut wardrobe. Charlotte knew the doll better than almost anyone\u2014except, perhaps, Ruth Handler herself\u2014and she was about to evaluate my designs.\n\nMy first memory of meeting her was that she was very tall and quite stylish. I felt good about my test designs, but in Charlotte\u2019s hands, who could tell? I didn\u2019t say a word as she turned the dolls over and over, closely examining every detail\u2014not just the styles themselves but also the construction, the seaming, even the fabrics I had chosen. After what seemed like an eternity, Charlotte rendered her verdict: \u201cI have no objection to hiring you,\u201d she said, her words revealing no enthusiasm for my designs. And with that, she walked out of the room.\n\nMy first thought: What just happened? Then Jerry Fire was beside me again, escorting me to another room to take a personality and aptitude test, the final step to becoming a Mattel employee in those early years. Once that was complete, he was shaking my hand, a big smile on his face. It took me a moment to realize that I had passed both tests\u2014Charlotte\u2019s and Mattel\u2019s\u2014and had gotten the job. All of a sudden, I was smiling along with Jerry.\n\nThe rest of that day was like a dream in which I sort of floated along. I couldn\u2019t stop grinning, because I had achieved exactly what that second ad had asked for: I was a fashion designer-stylist for Barbie.\n\nPeople talk about fate as an abstract idea, but in that moment, I fully embraced what it meant. The two advertisements I\u2019d responded to had serendipitously asked me to come in and interview on the same day at the same time. How could that not be destiny?\n\n__________________________________\n\nFrom the book DRESSING BARBIE by Carol Spencer. Copyright \u00a9 2023 by Carol Spencer.

    "text": "The \u201cBarbie\u201d movie has proved itself a box-office sensation, taking in $155 million on its opening weekend.\n\nBut can the \u201cBarbie\u201d collectibles market see as big a boom? Some experts say the surge is already happening \u2014 in particular for the doll they refer to as the holy grail of Barbies. As in Barbie No. 1, the first doll ever released by Mattel to bear the Barbie name, dating from 1959.\n\nBarbie fanatics speak of it in reverent terms. \u201cI lost sleep over this doll,\u201d one collector said in a YouTube GOOG, -1.31% GOOGL, -1.42% video that documented the arrival and unboxing of a Barbie No. 1.\n\nNeedless to say, collectors will pay a pretty penny for a Barbie No. 1. Prices can easily reach $10,000-plus, according to Barbie experts. The original doll sold for about $3, but there\u2019s a Barbie No. 1 doll on eBay EBAY, -0.46% currently going for $25,000.\n\nBut before you plunk down five figures for an investment-grade doll, we figured you might want to know a little more about this one-of-a-kind Barbie. Here goes:\n\nRelated: AMC had its busiest weekend since 2019, boosted by \u2018Barbie\u2019 and \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019\n\nWhat makes the \u2018Holy Grail\u2019 Barbie so special?\n\nObviously, it\u2019s all about being the first of its kind, not unlike a baseball player\u2019s rookie card (the 1952 Mickey Mantle card is often considered the holy grail of sports collectibles, though that can sell for millions of dollars). It\u2019s also about rarity. Experts say around 300,000 to 350,000 of those debut Barbies were sold in 1959, but the number of Barbie No. 1s that survived throughout the years \u2014 dolls are sold as toys, after all, not necessarily collectibles \u2014 is considerably less.\n\n(Mattel MAT, -1.05% reportedly now releases about 60 million Barbies annually, but the company didn\u2019t respond to a MarketWatch request for comment and information.)\n\nThere\u2019s also something to be said for No. 1\u2019s distinct look, marked by what veteran Barbie appraiser Dr. Lori Verderame describes as its \u201cdeep profile\u201d with a protruding nose and high forehead. It\u2019s a design very much inspired by the German-made Bild Lilli dolls that intrigued Barbie creator Ruth Handler.\n\nAre there any really rare examples of the original Barbie?\n\nRed-headed Barbie No. 1s are known to exist. Marl Davidson, a Barbie dealer based in Bradenton, Fla., says she once sold one for $50,000, and perhaps the holiest of holy grails is a salesman\u2019s Barbie sample case dating from the doll\u2019s early years. Davidson says she believes only two or three are around. And one surfaced? \u201cIt could go for $1 million,\u201d she says.\n\nAnd what makes some Barbie No. 1s more valuable than others?\n\nAs with almost any collectible category, it\u2019s all about condition. Barbie buyers are looking for a No. 1 that\u2019s as close to mint condition as possible, with all the original items \u2014 namely, the box, black stand, sunglasses, shoes, brochure and zebra-striped swimsuit. (There are also outfits and accessories dating from Barbie\u2019s early years, but these were sold separately; Verderame says a popular outfit from this period can sell for $150 to $200.)\n\nIronically, if the Barbie has stayed in the original box, it may affect the condition \u2014 Verderame explains that the packaging is acidic so it can \u201cdamage the piece over time,\u201d but she says collectors still \u201cwant it in the box.\u201d\n\nThen, there\u2019s the hair color. The original Barbie came in both blonde and brunette versions. Verderame says the blondes are generally more sought after since that\u2019s what most people think of as the Barbie classic. But Davidson says brunettes can actually have value since there were fewer made of them. Then again, she says, the collectors \u201cwho can afford it will have one of everything.\u201d\n\nHow can you tell if a first-edition 1959 Barbie is a fake?\n\nThere are various elements that will signify an original Barbie \u2014 most notably, a marking on the doll\u2019s, um, right buttock (this also applies to later Barbies, though). Also look for holes in the feet and what the Doll Reference site describes as \u201ctight curly bangs,\u201d among other identifiers. It\u2019s worth keeping in mind that you might find an original No. 1 doll, but with other parts that are not original \u2014 say, a replacement stand.\n\nWhat\u2019s the current market for the original Barbie?\n\nIt\u2019s soaring because of the movie, Verderame says. She notes that Barbie No. 1s that went for $10,000 as recently as three months ago are now selling in the $15,000-$25,000 range. Verderame anticipates the market will cool off after the fervor for the Warner Bros. WBD, +6.01% film dies down. But Davidson remains bullish on Barbie\u2019s longer-term prospects because of the doll\u2019s iconic appeal: \u201cThe price can only go up,\u201d she says.\n\nAre there any affordable alternatives to a first-edition Barbie?\n\nDavidson says collectors can also consider Barbie No. 3 as a collectible. It\u2019s a very early model, but it has a far more approachable price \u2014 Davidson says collectors can find one between $1,000 and $3,000.\n\nIf you want something way more affordable that still has potential to appreciate, Verderame says to consider iconic Barbies from the 1990s and 2000s that are currently selling for between $50 and $150.\n\nBut if you insist on a Barbie No. 1, Davidson says you can always buy one in lesser condition for a lesser price. Still, even a bald Barbie No. 1 won\u2019t come cheap, she warns. \u201cIt\u2019s going to go for a couple of grand,\u201d she says."

(CNN and Warner Bros. are both owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d also had a blowout weekend, with a domestic total of $46 million, according to estimates from media analytics company Comscore, bringing its worldwide total to almost half a billion dollars. Universal, which distributed the movie, estimated Oppenheimer will be Nolan\u2019s biggest non-superhero film of all-time in 40 regions, and his biggest film ever in 28.\n\nCrucially, these numbers reflect that not only is there high energy and excitement for movies, but an appetite for the movie theater experience.\n\nPeople dress up as the doll Barbie to attend the Barbie movie on July 21, 2023 in New York City. Stephanie Keith/Getty Images\n\n\u201cBarbenheimer was never going to happen on your TV, it\u2019s just not,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theater Owners in the United States. \u201cYou have to go into the theater to experience it.\u201d\n\nRepeat viewings are also fueling box office earnings. Midwest-based chain B&B Theaters estimated that across its 55 theaters, more than 2,100 people saw \u201cBarbie\u201d both opening weekend and this weekend, and almost 500 returned to see \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d\n\n\u201cHollywood\u201d is often considered interchangeable with \u201cthe movie industry,\u201d and O\u2019Leary notes that there has always been a strong movie theater culture in the United States.\n\nAfter the pandemic ravaged theaters and public screenings, people are now looking forward to \u201csitting in a theater with world-class projection and sound systems, having an immersive experience alongside other people,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d will trigger more and more people going to the movies by reminding them \u201cthe best of what the theatrical experience can be. It\u2019s a reawakening,\u201d he added.\n\nA fake doctor's note posted by movie theater chain B&B Theaters, excusing theatergoers from other commitments until they've seen both \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" on July 21, 2023. bbtheatres/Instagram\n\nO\u2019Leary expects the movies to perform well for weeks to come, noting there\u2019s been a rise over the past several years in very strong holdover weekends. That could be partly due to energetic word-of-mouth stoked by social media.\n\n\u201cAt their core, consumers want to go see a compelling story, they want to be entertained,\u201d he said. \u201cIf stories resonate with people\u2026 they tell other people.\u201d\n\nThe overwhelming appreciation for these creative projects means that the ongoing Writers Guild of America and actors union SAG-AFTRA strikes could be a dark cloud over the these financial successes, according to some analysts.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s pressure to resolve (these labor disputes) because the possibility of revenue is built on the foundation of having movies and actors to promote them,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. \u201cFor now we have high-profile films, but that pool will be drying out.\u201d\n\nWriters Guild of America and Screen Actors Guild members with supporters on a picket line outside Fox Studios in Los Angeles on July 21, 2023. Eric Thayer/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe production limbo caused by a lack of negotiations on the part of studios are leading to a ripple effect where the release dates for those projects will also be postponed. According to Boxoffice Pro chief analyst Shawn Robbins, this means that in the second half of 2023 and throughout 2024, theater chains will need \u201cto keep a weather eye on the horizon for problems beyond their control.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s important to celebrate the good times right now and realize they can be a barometer for the future, it\u2019s just as important to recognize the fight for equality by so many who play a part in creating the content we see on our screens, large and small,\u201d he added."

    "text": "The Warner Bros. Film Group in the U.S. has made a public apology about social media activity concerning the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d meme that has caused major offence in Japan.\n\n\u201cWarner Brothers regrets its recent insensitive social media engagement. The studio offers a sincere apology,\u201d the company said in a statement emailed to Variety on Tuesday.\n\nThe move follows criticism of Warner by members of the public in Japan, the start of an online petition against the studio and an unusual maneuver by the Japanese distribution arm of Warner.\n\nWarner Bros. Japan on Monday posted a statement on its official Japanese-language \u201cBarbie\u201d Twitter account criticizing the studio\u2019s U.S. branch for feeding into the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d craze on social media. The \u201cBarbie\u201d U.S. Twitter account has positively interacted with some fan posts about \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d which refers to the dual summer releases of Universal\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cBarbie\u201d movies. Both movies were released on July 21 in North America and many international territories and became box office juggernauts. Together, they boosted the box office to its fourth highest-grossing weekend in history during their debut outings.\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d has not been released in Japan and no release date has yet been determined. While the film debates the issue of whether the bombings ultimately saved lives and brought international peace, the latest skirmish underlines the continuing sensitivity of the nuclear weapons debate in Japan. By some estimates, as many as 250,000 people were killed by the two atomic bombs dropped by the U.S. on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.\n\n\u201cWe consider it extremely regrettable that the official account of the American headquarters for the movie \u2018Barbie\u2019 reacted to the social media postings of \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 fans,\u201d Warner Bros. Japan wrote in a statement published on the \u201cBarbie\u201d Japan Twitter profile. \u201cWe take this situation very seriously. We are asking the U.S. headquarters to take appropriate action. We apologize to those who were offended by this series of inconsiderate reactions. Warner Bros Japan.\u201d\n\nResponding to one \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d fan art poster which depicts Margot Robbie\u2019s Barbie sitting on the shoulders of Cillian Murphy\u2019s J. Robert Oppenheimer in front of a fiery atomic mushroom cloud, the \u201cBarbie\u201d U.S. Twitter account wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a summer to remember.\u201d Twitter, now called X, added a community note to the post explaining the historical context of the mushroom cloud image.\n\n\u201cAt 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945 (Showa 20), an atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima for the first time in human history,\u201d the Twitter note reads. \u201cThe particular nature of the damage caused by the atomic bombs is that mass destruction and mass murder occurred instantaneously and indiscriminately.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d craze has drawn criticism in Japan for making light of the mass destruction caused by the atomic bombs. The hashtag #NoBarbenheimer has trended in the country in recent days."

    "text": "It was only supposed to be a meme. And yet, if you made it out to the cinema this weekend \u2013 having most likely pre-booked your tickets, rapidly becoming gold dust as entire picturehouses sold out \u2013 you\u2019ll have seen foyers flooded with people doing the most (seemingly) deranged double-bill of recent memory: Christopher Nolan\u2019s soul-rattling atomic bomb creation story Oppenheimer, and Greta Gerwig\u2019s fuchsia fantasia toy story Barbie. There were pink outfits galore. There were countless discussions of the ideal viewing order. There were celebratory t-shirts designed specifically for the event. And it all came under one ridiculous name: \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019.\n\nThe result has been box office dynamite. Already, Barbie has made $344 million worldwide, with a record-breaking $162 million debut in the States \u2013 giving Greta Gerwig the mantle of highest-grossing opening weekend for a female director. And Oppenheimer \u2013 a three-hour, often black-and-white historical political drama \u2013 was caught up in the chain reaction, earning over $174 million, with IMAX cinemas now sold out weeks in advance. It all adds up to the biggest box office weekend since Avengers: Endgame arrived in 2019, this time split across two non-franchise, non-superhero, non-typical juggernauts.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time a viral trend has made the leap from internet gag to IRL phenomenon \u2013 last year saw Gen Z go wild for \u2018GentleMinions\u2019, where another seemingly ridiculous idea (dress up in your finest suits to celebrate the belated return of those sentient yellow Tic Tacs in Minions: The Rise Of Gru) resulted in major turnouts at the multiplex. \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 began from a similarly \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be funny if\u2026\u2019 notion, when film fans discovered that Nolan\u2019s deeply serious A-bomb biopic was launching on the same day as Gerwig\u2019s deeply unserious plastic-fantastic comedy; the notion of seeing both in quick succession seemed inherently hilarious.\n\nIt went from a notion that was merely pleasantly ridiculous, to pleasantly ridiculous and an absolute must-do.\n\nAnd yet, somewhere along the way, that idea mutated, gained traction. Maybe it was the way the memed designs \u2013 a figure, half-Barbie half-Oppenheimer, donning a hat; \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 written in the Barbie font \u2013 quickly became purchasable items, morphing from a digital running joke into something tangible and real-world, as did the concept of actually seeing both on the same day. Perhaps it was the way that it encroached on the press tour for each film: Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie posed with their Oppenheimer cinema ticket (sparked by Mission: Impossible\u2019s Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise; notably, the trend didn\u2019t become \u2018Barbenheimpossible\u2019), while Christopher Nolan called the notion of doing the double a \u201cgreat\u201d one. Like Margot Robbie\u2019s Barbie herself \u2013 and, for that matter, Oppenheimer\u2019s atomic bomb \u2013 what began as a mere idea soon became real.\n\nSurely contributing to the \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 blowout is that both films received excellent reviews \u2013 after weeks of omnipresent Barbie marketing, a thunderous Oppenheimer campaign, and all the accompanying Barben-hype, the critical consensus for both Gerwig and Nolan\u2019s films was rapturously positive. And while strong reviews don\u2019t always equal strong box office, it had a catalytic effect here \u2013 evolving the conversation once more from the notion that you could watch both in a day, to the idea that you should; that each film stands as a triumph from a distinctive directorial voice, and that for all their seeming differences, to watch both back-to-back would mean seeing two of the best movies of the year across one single super-sized, super-cinematic outing. It went from a notion that was merely pleasantly ridiculous, to pleasantly ridiculous and an absolute must-do.\n\nAs the idea snowballed \u2013 the realisation that people really were going to see both spurring others on to do the same \u2013 it soon became clear that Barbie and Oppenheimer make for a surprisingly great double bill. The Day-Glo colours and wacky comedy of Barbie and the intense atmosphere of doom of Oppenheimer don\u2019t just weirdly complement each other; in Gerwig\u2019s (and co-writer Noah Baumbach\u2019s) hands, Barbie itself contrasts its gleaming surfaces with deep explorations of existential ideas. They are both, oddly, about reckoning with our purpose in life; about interrogating the (destructive) role of men in society; about bridging the chasm between ideas and reality. Just, one does it with neon rollerblades and a Dua Lipa disco track. And they\u2019re both big-screen must-sees \u2013 distinctive examples of impeccable filmmaking craft, delivering undeniable cinematic spectacle in a different way to the usual fight sequences of a summer blockbuster.\n\nThe cumulative effect of Barbenheimer created the very thing that Hollywood has perhaps struggled to conjure in recent years: the sense of an all-out cinematic event. It was one that people actively wanted to be part of: to contribute to the conversation of whether you\u2019d seen one, or both; to share stories of how busy it was in the cinema; to see the most-hyped releases of the year in packed houses, all laughing together at Barbie\u2019s most uproarious jokes, or in a shared sense of deep terror at Oppenheimer\u2019s bomb blast. You really did have to be there \u2013 of everything to do in the world this weekend, being at your local cinema was the #1 destination. It\u2019s a rare but wonderful occurrence, most recently felt with Endgame\u2019s \u2018see it before anyone else spoils it\u2019 excitement, or Parasite\u2019s \u2018no, this is really one of the best and most enthralling thrillers you\u2019ll have seen in years\u2019 dismantling of the one-inch-tall subtitle barrier (as director Bong Joon-Ho put it).\n\nAnd that\u2019s where cinemas have really won this weekend: whether driven by memes, by reviews, or by a simple desire to be involved, people have flocked to their local movie-houses this weekend, and probably had their best experience there in years. The lessons Hollywood takes from it remain to be seen \u2013 a Barbenheimer likely can\u2019t be manufactured, nor is it a simple case of counter-programming, nor necessarily a signal that audiences want more movies based on historic toy brands or, um, weapons of mass destruction. Perhaps it\u2019s a sign that sequels aren\u2019t the be-all and end-all anymore. Perhaps it\u2019s an indication that allowing talented filmmakers to take major risks and marketing them properly is the way forward. Perhaps people just wanted to wear pink and have fun \u2013 and who can blame them? But for whatever reason audiences entered their Barbie and Oppenheimer screenings, they likely left with a greater appreciation of the cinema experience. Your move, Hollywood."

In fact, both films' ticket sales fell just 43% from their opening weekends.\n\nTypically, blockbuster features will see ticket sales fall between 50% and 70% after the debut weekend. Second week numbers are often looked at by box office analysts as an indicator of whether a film will have longevity at the box office or will fizzle quickly. The smaller the drop, the better.\n\n\"'Barbenheimer' will go down as one of the most notable and unforeseeable milestones in the history of cinema not just for what it means to the bottom-line box office dollars for the industry but also as a cultural event centered around moviegoing,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.\n\nOver the weekend, \"Barbie\" added $93 million, bringing its domestic haul to $351 million. The Greta Gerwig and Mattel collaboration for Warner Bros. is nearing $800 million worldwide and could become the second billion-dollar film of 2023.\n\nUniversal 's \"Oppenheimer,\" meanwhile, tallied another $46.7 million over the weekend. Its domestic gross now stands at $175 million. Globally, it's generated $405 million.\n\n\"For a domestic summer marketplace desperately in need of a box office boost, the July 21 simultaneous theatrical debuts of 'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' set off a chain reaction of overall box office that has infused the all-important season with nearly three quarters of a billion dollars of bonus cash,\" Dergarabedian said.\n\nHeading into \"Barbenheimer's\" first weekend, the summer box office, which runs from the first weekend in May through Labor Day, was down around 7% compared to 2022. Two weeks later, it's up 9%, according to data from Comscore.\n\nSimilarly, the confluence of these two films boosted the overall domestic box office compared with last year's haul to this point. Prior to \"Barbenheimer,\" ticket sales were up 12%. Two weeks later, they were up 20%.\n\nThe overall domestic box office still lags behind prepandemic levels by around 16%, however. And prospects for catching up are dwindling as studios have started to move big releases to next year as Hollywood digs in for drawn-out writers' and actors' strikes.\n\nDisclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC. NBCUniversal is the distributor of \"Oppenheimer.\""

Revenue for the July 21-23 weekend was the fourth-biggest of all time; in addition, it was the first time ever that one movie opened to $100 million or more and another to $50 million or more. Barbie scored $155 million, followed by $80.5 million for Oppenheimer. No one in Hollywood anticipated such a staggering turnout.\n\nThe seventh installment in Paramount and Skydance\u2019s storied Mission: Impossible series, which finished Sunday with a domestic total of $118.8 million, had hoped to earn as much as $25 million in its second outing.\n\nThe question now is whether Dead Reckoning Part One can level out and enjoy a long run as other series installments have done, and just as Cruise\u2019s Top Gun: Maverick did. Executives across Hollywood, and not just at Paramount, aren\u2019t ruling Dead Reckoning out just yet, especially since it has a better critics\u2019 score on Rotten Tomatoes than Barbie and Oppenheimer, as well as strong audience exit scores.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the story has yet been written,\u201d says one executive at a rival studio.\n\nMission: Impossible pics have never sported mega-openings, yet expectations were high for Dead Reckoning after Cruise\u2019s Top Gun: Maverick opened to $160.5 million over Memorial Day weekend in 2022, including $126.7 million for the three days. Dead Reckoning had been tracking to open to $90 million in its first five days beginning July 12; instead, it took in a franchise-best $78.5 million, not adjusted for inflation.\n\nTitles in the Mission franchise have always drawn a larger percentage of their global gross from the foreign box office. Dead Reckoning Part One is no exception. It earned another $55 million from 72 markets in its second weekend for a foreign tally of $252.1 million and $370.9 million globally through Sunday. It is doing especially well in Asia, where Barbie and Oppenheimer aren\u2019t strong players. And in a number of markets, it is pacing 15 percent or more ahead of 2018\u2019s Mission: Impossible \u2014 Fallout. In Japan, it debuted to $7.9 million, 23 percent ahead of Fallout, which earned a franchise-best $571.5 million overseas for a global total of $791.7 million, including $220.2 million in North America.\n\nMission: Impossible 7 had to contend with losing Imax screens for three weeks to Oppenheimer, in addition to losing premium large-format screens to both Oppenheimer and Barbie. The upcharge for Imax and PLFs is significant and can have a big impact on the bottom line. In early July, Imax screens were dedicated to Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.\n\nCruise\u2019s latest movie, directed by Christopher McQuarrie, cost nearly $300 million to produce and saw its release date delayed numerous times because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was initially set to open in summer of 2021, then summer or fall of 2022. Its release date ultimately landed on mid-July of this year, a date dictated by the shooting schedule of Dead Reckoning Part Two and Cruise\u2019s availability to promote Part One (the actor is known for his global marketing efforts).\n\nAdds another observer: \u201cBarbenheimer siphoned off MI7\u2032s potential this weekend, with Oppenheimer drawing older males away from Dead Reckoning. Not only that, Sound of Freedom is an unexpected force to be reckoned with and is presenting competition from an unlikely source.\u201d\n\nEstimates for the U.S. box office show Angel Studios\u2019 faith-based political thriller Sound of Freedom beating Dead Reckoning for the weekend with $20.1 million for a cume of $123.4 million (Sound of Freedom opened July 4), according to Comscore. Paramount and other studios show Dead Reckoning beating Sound of Freedom; Monday actuals will determine the order.\n\nMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part Two is set to open in theaters June 28, 2024. McQuarrie and Cruise have shot much of the movie, but production is now halted because of the SAG-AFTRA strike in another moment of reckoning for the storied action franchise.\n\nThings looked different in late June, when Cruise \u2014 Hollywood\u2019s highest-profile advocate for the theatrical experience \u2014 urged audiences to see Dial of Destiny. And, yes, two other movies in a surprisingly effective plea. Wrote the actor on Instagram : \u201cI love a double feature, and it doesn\u2019t get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie.\u201d"

Learn more about the opportunities here.\n\nA new AI-generated movie trailer that splices together the wildly-hyped movies Barbie and Oppenheimer into a mashup \u2014 featuring a pink mushroom cloud \u2014 has gone viral.\n\nThe trailer offers a spot-on sendup on the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d hype that had moviegoers flocking to see both movies back-to-back, even though the two films couldn\u2019t be more different \u2014 Oppenheimer is a sober biopic about the life and legacy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, father of the atomic bomb, while Barbie is a fizzy, feminist, live-action look at the famous doll.\n\n>>Don\u2019t miss our special issue: The Future of the data center: Handling greater and greater demands.<<\n\nPowered by image generation AI Midjourney and movie generator Runway Gen2 and featuring AI-generated voices supposedly belonging to Margot Robbie and Matt Damon, the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d crossover took just four days to make, according to the creator\u2019s Reddit post, where he shared a link to his course on AI filmmaking.\n\nVB Event The AI Impact Tour Connect with the enterprise AI community at VentureBeat\u2019s AI Impact Tour coming to a city near you! Learn More\n\nBut as a reporter covering AI\u2019s cheerful, bullish, even fluffy side as well as its serious, sobering side, I can\u2019t help but think about three things the AI-generated \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 movie trailer says about the state of generative AI right now.\n\n1. AI-generated entertainment is moving fast \u2014 perfect for today\u2019s viral moments.\n\nSo, it\u2019s no surprise that as the Barbenheimer hype rocketed upward, any online content-maker could jump on board with their own quick-and-dirty AI-generated take to share across social platforms. A traditional ad agency couldn\u2019t possibly move fast enough to pull off the same kind of \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d sendup to meet the moment, and the costs would be prohibitive enough that they likely wouldn\u2019t even try.\n\nIn an era when social media content is part of the zeitgeist more than ever, there\u2019s no doubt that the speed of development of AI-generated entertainment is perfectly placed for today\u2019s viral moments. Back in March, for example, a Reddit user shared an AI-generated video of Will Smith eating spaghetti on the r/StableDiffusion subreddit. It quickly spread on social media as well as the mainstream press, with one article saying the video \u201cwould haunt you for the rest of your life.\u201d\n\n2. The \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 trailer comes as creatives strike and regulators play AI catchup.\n\nHollywood has come nearly to a halt in recent weeks, with SAG-AFTRA actors and writers currently on strike and expressing particular concerns about the impact of gen AI on their industry and jobs. The \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d trailer is a perfect example: Who needs the pricey services of Margot Robbie and Matt Damon if you can come up with a serviceable AI copy? Why use the time-consuming work of artists or editors when you have the speedy output of Midjourney and Runway Gen 2?\n\nAt the same time, AI-focused creatives who are excited by the possibilities of gen AI are going full-steam ahead \u2014 even as regulators and policy-makers sprint to catch up. The Senate will be schooled in AI this fall with an eye towards a foundation for developing regulations in 2024. Will that be too little, too late?\n\n3. The current generative AI hype may just be a candy-colored wrapper around a more serious, unsettling reality.\n\nThe AI-generated Barbenheimer trailer is, in my opinion, funny and adorable. But the idea that you could wrap one of history\u2019s most horrifying periods \u2014 the development of the atomic bomb during World War II, which led to the death of hundreds of thousands at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 \u2014 in a candy-colored Barbie wrapper and a pink mushroom cloud is equal parts stunning and shocking.\n\nThat\u2019s gen AI in a nutshell \u2014 stunning and shocking, exciting and frightening, dazzling and appalling, sometimes all at once. But certainly, all stakeholders involved in AI development need to consider not just the sugary surface of what gen AI can do, but the deep, real issues that lay underneath."

    "text": "Rafu Wire Service and Staff Reports\n\nWarner Bros. has issued an apology in response to a controversy over popular memes combining two movies \u2014 \u201cBarbie,\u201d based on Mattel\u2019s line of dolls, and \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d a historical drama about the development of the atomic bomb.\n\nAn example of a meme combining \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d\n\nSince the movies have topped the box office in the U.S. since their release on July 21, media reports encouraging viewers to see both, on the same day if possible, have coined the term \u201cBarbenheimer.\u201d\n\nThe cheerful memes combine Margot Robbie as Barbie with Cillian Murphy as physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, often with a mushroom cloud in the background. One meme showed Barbie with a mushroom-cloud hairstyle.\n\nWarner Bros.\u2019 initial response to the mashups was positive. \u201cBarbie\u201d is distributed by Warner Bros. and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d by Universal.\n\nAfter receiving criticism on July 31 from Warner Bros. Japan LLC, Warner Bros. Film Group said in a statement, \u201cWarner Brothers regrets its recent insensitive social media engagement. The studio offers a sincere apology.\u201d\n\nWarner Bros Japan\u2019s statement read, in part, \u201cBecause the movies \u2018Barbie\u2019 and \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 were both released in America on July 21, there is currently a movement driven by overseas fans to watch them together (#Barbenheimer), but this is not an official movement. We find the reaction to this fan-driven movement from the official American account for the movie \u2018Barbie\u2019 to be extremely regrettable.\u201d\n\nYoung activists in Japan on Aug. 1 launched a petition urging the distributors of the hit movies to disavow the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d hashtag, saying that it is a \u201cclear indication that there is a widespread lack of awareness about the atrocities of atomic bombing\u201d and that the social media activity \u201ccompletely disregards the suffering of atomic bomb victims and survivors.\u201d\n\n\u201cBarbie\u201d is slated for release in Japan on Aug. 11, just days after the 78th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on Aug. 6 and 9, respectively. A Japanese release date for \u201cOppenheimer\u201d has yet to be scheduled.\n\nAlthough \u201cOppenheimer\u201d depicts the testing of the first atomic bomb in the New Mexico desert, the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not shown.\n\nAnother film about the development of the A-bomb, \u201cFat Man and Little Boy\u201d (1989), with Dwight Schultz as Oppenheimer, also depicted the testing of the first bomb but not the effects of \u201cLittle Boy\u201d and \u201cFat Man\u201d (the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively).\n\nA number of Japanese films have been made about the horrors of the atomic bombings, including Shohei Imamura\u2019s \u201cBlack Rain\u201d (1989), based on the novel by Masuji Ibuse, and the animated feature \u201cBarefoot Gen\u201d (1983), based on the manga by Keiji Nakazawa.\n\nMiho Tanaka, 28, one of the activists behind the signature campaign, said she felt \u201ca mixture of anger, sadness and resignation\u201d upon seeing the memes.\n\n\u201cI feel like atomic bomb survivors have experienced things like this many times, but even so, I felt I don\u2019t want them to have to see these images,\u201d she said.\n\nTanaka, however, said that the campaign has no problem with the existence of an Oppenheimer film, and she expressed admiration that the story could be the subject of popular art.\n\n\u201cI was really surprised the U.S., Hollywood no less, could produce a film like that and show it domestically. That it could make a film that would create debate about nuclear weapons is a great thing,\u201d she said.\n\nIn Los Angeles, anti-nuclear activist Tsukuru Fors posted one of the memes on social media and said, \u201cJokes and memes that are being made about the movies \u2018Barbie\u2019 & \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 are not OK. I don\u2019t need to tell you; I hope it is obvious. It is great that people are \u2018excited\u2019 about \u2018Oppenheimer.\u2019 I hope that people will go see the movie and that it will somehow motivate them to advocate for the abolishment of nuclear weapons. (Neither the U.S. nor Japanese government has signed/ratified the TPNW, Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.)\n\n\u201cI just think that this insensitivity is what happens when the voices/stories of the victims are conveniently eliminated/hidden away from the narrative. That is why it is my/our job to amplify the voices/stories of the victims whenever possible. I owe it to the people of Hiroshima, who gave me the sense of belonging in my formative, teenage years. I owe it to 350 young girls at my high school who lost their lives on Aug. 6, 1945.\n\n\u201cThe A-bomb of Hiroshima and Nagasaki collectively took more than 200,000 lives within a few months. Many had to witness their loved ones die in front of their eyes. In fact, many had to leave their loved ones behind while they screamed for help. Many could not find the remains of their loved ones, because they either instantly evaporated, incinerated, or turned unrecognizable.\n\n\u201cThe A-bombs caused intergenerational traumas that affect people to this day. And let\u2019s not forget that nuclear atrocities neither began nor ended with Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Please remember hibakusha (victims of nuclear atrocities worldwide) \u2026\n\n\u201cThis summer, please go and seek out the stories told in the victims\u2019 voices. Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum has an excellent online database where you can find drawings by survivors, which would leave you overwhelmed but give you the sense of the gravity of the atrocity \u2026.\n\n\u201cI know that some people are so excited about the movies and want to tell the world to go and watch them both, but these jokes and memes are NOT the way to do it.\u201d"

    "text": "German epidemiologists are warning of a summer wave of coronavirus infections, blaming in part mass gatherings such as the Barbenheimer double feature craze.\n\nThe government\u2019s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), says that while infections remain low compared with at the height of the pandemic, they have been on the rise for the past month.\n\nAccording to the government\u2019s Pandemic Radar, which is updated daily by the health ministry, visits to the doctor due to a Covid 19 infection are up 175% on the previous week, and there have been 2,400 cases reported to the RKI this week compared with 400 the previous week, and double the rate of a month ago.\n\nHospital admissions of people with coronavirus are up 50%. More than half of Germany\u2019s monitoring stations, in particular sewage plants, have indicated a rise in viral load detected in wastewater this month.\n\nThe number of official test results shows the rate to be low, at 3 in every 100,000 people. However, the figure itself is hardly a reflection of the real rate, as so few tests are being carried out.\n\n\u201cIt could be that we\u2019re having a summer wave,\u201d Timo Ulrichs an epidemiologist at the Berlin Akkon University of Human Sciences, told the news portal Spiegel, adding that the so-called \u201cBarbenheimer effect\u201d was capable of boosting the numbers.\n\nGermany was among the countries where cinemagoers were encouraged to go to watch the blockbuster films Barbie and Oppenheimer as a double feature, in an effort to boost cinema attendance which has yet to recover since the pandemic. So far just under 4 million have seen Barbie, and more than 2.5 million Oppenheimer.\n\nThe idea of a Barbenheimer effect on the spread of the virus was first playfully mooted by the vaccine expert Peter Hotez of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.\n\nSuggesting on Twitter that it might be of concern, due to the millions of people surging to cinemas and spending hours in a windowless room together, he concluded: \u201cWe\u2019ll probably never know since no one seems to be keeping track of such things any more.\u201d\n\nNew York has recently recorded a doubling in hospitalisations due to the EG.5 Eris variant of Omicron, which the World Health Organization last week classified as a \u201cvariant of interest\u201d.\n\nHotez urged people to keep up with their boosters and wear a pink medical mask \u2013 in a nod to Barbie \u2013 if they were planning a cinema visit.\n\nGermany\u2019s health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said in reaction to rising levels elsewhere in the world, and the increase in Germany, where the XBB.1.5 variant is currently responsible for most new infections: \u201cour early warning system is activated\u201d.\n\nGermans are being encouraged to get booster jabs in the autumn, if they belong to a higher-risk group, such as those over 60, and people who are overweight, suffer from a lung disease such as COPD, or work in a risky environment such as a hospital. Those who are sick are being advised to stay at home."

Perfected down to the minute details, it solidifies the film as director Christopher Nolan\u2019s best, and perhaps his most insurmountable.\n\nHere\u2019s Nick Schager\u2019s take:\n\n\u201cChristopher Nolan\u2019s cinema is one of dualities: between knowledge and ignorance (Memento); seeing and sightlessness (Insomnia); good and evil (The Dark Knight); illusion and authenticity (The Prestige); dreaming and waking (Inception); courage and cowardice (Dunkirk); and the past and the present (Tenet). In that regard, Oppenheimer\u2014a film of endless contrasts and contradictions\u2014is the fullest expression of the writer/director\u2019s artistry to date.\n\nPropelled by the inexorable march of progress and imagination and electrified by the terrible thrill of theories, dreams, and miracles realized in all their devastating glory, it\u2019s a divided epic of awe and horror, fission and fusion. It\u2019s simultaneously a unified portrait of a conflicted man and a singular achievement for Hollywood\u2019s reigning blockbuster auteur.\n\nAdapted from Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning 2005 biography American Prometheus, Oppenheimer (July 21, in theaters) begins with images of raindrops falling on a pond\u2019s surface and fiery detonations in the void\u2014the first of innumerable opposing visions that are in unlikely harmony, or at least uneasy coexistence, in Nolan\u2019s masterpiece.\n\nAn individual of myriad paradoxes, Cillian Murphy\u2019s J. Robert Oppenheimer is a scientist (and the father of theoretical physics in the United States) who adores art and culture; a towering intellectual who\u2019s incompetent in the laboratory; an arrogant leader who\u2019s unwilling to fight; a devoted lover and partner who\u2019s habitually unfaithful; and the architect of modern annihilation who wants to foster global peace. When, early in his academic career, he\u2019s drawn to quantum physics, because it suggests that the impossible\u2014namely, that light is both a wave and a particle\u2014is true, it\u2019s a telling snapshot of his inherent attraction to the irreconcilable.\u201d\n\nRead more.\n\nSee: Barbie\n\nBarbie makes the plastic way more than just fantastic; Greta Gewig\u2019s film reaches new heights for mainstream cinema, proving that it\u2019s not necessary to sacrifice a story\u2019s empathetic soul just because its main character comes in a box.\n\nHere\u2019s Coleman Spilde\u2019s take:\n\n\u201cWith all of the chatter regarding the Barbie movie for the last four years, the most pressing question has ended up being whether Greta Gerwig\u2019s film could exceed the insurmountable hype surrounding it. There was an influx of candid set photos, multiple trailers and pre-release clips, and massively popular memes that quickly created a level of fatigue that was just as ubiquitous as the Barbie poster generator. Barbie was a sensation long before we were close enough to see the radiant pink glow of its looming July 21 release date. Surely, no matter how good the film was, it could never fully live up to that amount of sheer anticipation.\n\nBut to settle for tempered expectations is simply not the Barbie way. Barbie can be a doctor, a CEO, a politician, and even a damn mermaid. The sky's the limit for Barbie\u2014scratch that; she\u2019ll become an astronaut and defy that restriction too. With all of these achievements under Barbie\u2019s belt, who better to bring her story to the big screen than Gerwig? In her career as a writer and a director, Gerwig has crafted exceptional, singular films that brilliantly assess the subtleties of womanhood. No one is quite so adept at making the ultra-specific feel universal.\u201d\n\nRead more.\n\nSkip: Futurama\n\nFuturama\u2019s third reboot revives the iconic animated comedy for another blast through space and time, but the new season\u2019s futurist satire of the 2020s often feels one-note, relying on references to the show\u2019s substantially more impressive original run.\n\nHere\u2019s Allegra Frank\u2019s take:\n\n\u201cAmong the countless Simpsons jokes I think about on a near-constant basis, perhaps none comes to mind more often than \u2018Moe gets a cell phone.\u2019 In Season 13 of The Simpsons, the show was already well-aware of its own waning critical reception. It lampooned its longevity\u2014which, 21 seasons later, has only become even more surprising\u2014with a self-mocking song performed by NRBQ about how \u2018they\u2019ll never stop the Simpsons\u2019: \u2018Have no fears, we\u2019ve got stories for years,\u2019 it goes. \u2018Like Marge becomes a robot! Maybe Moe gets a cell phone! Has Bart ever owned a bear?\u2019\n\n\u2018Moe gets a cell phone\u2019 is a wildly threadbare premise for an episode, but if The Simpsons were to continue forever, threadbare premises would have to do. All three of the joking predictions in that song have since come true; Moe got himself a flip phone, and Bart prank-texted him on it. For as often as fans try to argue that The Simpsons is \u2018still good,\u2019 \u2018They\u2019ll Never Stop the Simpsons\u2019 became not a joke, but an ironic prophecy\u2014a testament to how a good thing doesn\u2019t need to live forever. This was top of mind as I watched Hulu\u2019s reboot of Futurama, The Simpsons\u2019 sister series and perhaps the most immortal television show of the 21st century.\u201d\n\nRead more.\n\nSee: Harley Quinn Season 4\n\nHarley Quinn Season 4 takes the off-the-wall animated series further than ever. The show\u2019s gloriously cheeky nature still pops with this season\u2019s raunchy humor, but it's Harley\u2019s search for personal growth that makes the series more than just vulgar hilarity.\n\nHere\u2019s Laura Bradley\u2019s take:\n\n\u201cAll around the Bat Cave in Harley Quinn, you\u2019ll find details designed to remind you of the Bat Family\u2019s one rule. The pillowcase, the WiFi password, and even the singing fish on the wall all want observers to remember that in this crew, \u2018We Don\u2019t Kill.\u2019 As reasonable an edict as that might be for a group of vigilantes, and as reformed as the Joker\u2019s former sidekick has become, that demand proves difficult for our newly minted \u2018hero.\u2019\n\nWhen she first embraced her main-character energy at the start of Harley Quinn, Kaley Cuoco\u2019s pigtailed harlequin wanted nothing more than to become the empress of darkness\u2014or, at least, a card-carrying Legion of Doom member. By the end of Season 3, however, she\u2019d switched sides to fight with the good guys, even as her girlfriend, Poison Ivy (Lake Bell) took over the villainous group as CEO. Now, as Season 4 kicks off with four episodes on Max starting July 27, the couple\u2019s professional goals could not be further apart.\u201d\n\nRead more.\n\nSign up for our See Skip newsletter here to find out which new shows and movies are worth watching, and which aren\u2019t."

The audience was 65 percent female. \u201cFor a film this pink, you would have expected the audience to be closer to 90 percent female \u2014 we got a ton of guys,\u201d said Jeff Goldstein, president of domestic distribution at Warner Bros. \u201cIt exploded everywhere: large markets, small markets, coast to coast.\u201d\n\nImage Harrison Hood, 24, arrived at the AMC Kips Bay theater in Manhattan wearing \u201cBarbie\u201d regalia. Credit... Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times\n\nSome theaters seemed to be caught off guard. One high-end theater in the Washington, D.C. suburbs went all out on promotion, with pink lights to highlight \u201cBarbie\u201d and a wall of movie posters featuring both films. But the theater may have miscalculated Saturday attendance. By the 10 p.m. showing, it had run out of multiple food items. It also lacked soft drinks and, amazingly, ice.\n\nAnother theater in Arlington, Va., had it worse: The air conditioning went out, leading to a sweltering experience. While the theater offered refunds, many ticket buyers stayed.\n\nThe question now is whether Hollywood can keep the momentum going. Studio executives have long pointed out that moviegoing begets moviegoing \u2014 that the habit of watching movies in theaters is crucial. Coming up, however, studios are facing another crisis: A strike by unionized actors, which started on July 14, could force movie companies to push back coming films because striking stars cannot take part in publicity campaigns. \u201cChallengers,\u201d a sports drama involving a love triangle and starring Zendaya, has already been pushed from September to April.\n\nThere are no talks scheduled between SAG-AFTRA, as the actors\u2019 union is known, and studios.\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d helped fuel \u201cBarbie\u201d and vice versa, with their simultaneous release nicknamed Barbenheimer and movie fans captivated by their wild incongruity. Nolan\u2019s film, which cost Universal Pictures at least $100 million to make, not including a megawatt marketing campaign, is a three-hour period drama about Robert Oppenheimer, the man known as \u201cthe father of the atomic bomb.\u201d About 200,000 people purchased tickets to see \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d as a double feature, according to the National Association of Theater Owners, a trade organization."

The production schedules for several movies have already been impacted, the strategists wrote in a note to clients.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Absent a resolution,\" analyst David Karnovsky wrote, \"we expect the strike will remain an overhang to Cinemark shares and limit upside regardless of whether the box office outperforms near term.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 has outperformed each of the four theater stocks since May, and extended turmoil in Hollywood threatens to weigh on the companies for the foreseeable future. Citing data from Boxoffice Pro, Bloomberg Intelligence lowered its outlook for the theater industry's revenue by 2%, to about $8.9 billion.\n\nEarlier this month, the Screen Actors Guild announced a walkout after failing to reach a deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture & Television Producers. They joined the Writers Guild of America, which has been on strike since May.\n\n\"Actors are no longer promoting their movies, creating a demand headwind,\" JPMorgan's Karnovsky wrote. \"The impact of this is difficult to quantify and will vary based on the film, though the recent underperformance of The Flash highlights the importance of effective marketing. While we don't think the strike will impact demand in the very near term, we do see potential risk to films dated for late summer /early fall, which could have the compounding effect of slowing box office momentum ahead of 2024.\""

Fans have made double and triple trips to go watch the movie in theaters again and again. But some people around the world they're only now getting a chance to book their tickets to Barbieland. The Margot Robbie starrer is finally released in Japan, after a huge controversy related to Barbenheimer memes. Here's what happened.\n\nBarbie releases in Japan after Barbenheimer controversy\n\nTickets for Babrie are flying off the shelf in Japan. The Greta Gerwig Directorial, fortunately, clashed with a national holiday in Japan that marks the start of the extended summer holiday week in the country, prompting many people to go out for a movie night. The viral trend of \"Barbenheimer\" stirred controversy in Japan, as the country had recently commemorated the 78th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In the now-deleted post on Twitter, Warner Bros. marketing account for Barbie had started posting fan-made memes which showed Robbie alongside Oppenheimer's Cillian Murphy merged with the images of nuclear explosions.\n\nThe outrage was so intense that at one point a petition was made on Change.org urging Warner Bros and Universal Pictures, the studio behind Oppenheimer, to stop using the #Barbenheimer on social media. During that period, #NoBarbenheimer gained traction in the East Asian country leading Warner's Japan division to publicly criticize its U.S. counterpart, prompting the latter to issue an apology the following week. Despite the controversy, Japanese fans of the film expressed that the situation did not deter them from wanting to watch the movie in theaters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nALSO READ: Oppenheimer star Cillian Murphy open to playing Ken in Barbie sequel; praises Barbenheimer\n\nNo Oppenheimer release date in sight\n\nWhile fans were finally able to see Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling's Barbie on the big screens, the same cannot be said for Christopher Nolan's movie. No official release date for Oppenheimer has been made public in Japan. The Cillian Murphy starrer has faced criticism for its limited acknowledgment of the devastating impact of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, which resulted in the loss of over 200,000 lives.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbie has taken over the world, quite literally, you can't possibly scroll on social media for 2 minutes without coming across at least 1 post about the movie.\n\nALSO READ: Why did Warner Bros apologize to Japanese division over Barbenheimer meme?

    "text": "Photo-Illustration: Vulture; Photos: Warner Brothers, Universal Pictures\n\nAt the corner of 68th Street and Broadway, Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One is serving only one purpose: being my decoy ticket as I enter the world of Barbenheimer. After a successful opening weekend of his own, Tom Cruise just might be flopping in the face of these unlikely twin movies, officially born on July 21, that are ushering in a palpably exciting cinematic moment. Before arriving, I had a stray thought that maybe Barbenheimer exists only in the hearts of the terminally online, hyped up by media people such as myself but not really going to make as much noise IRL. Like, fine, the National Association of Theatre Owners is projecting that more than 200,000 moviegoers will do the double feature, per the Wrap, but that doesn\u2019t mean much to someone who hasn\u2019t taken a math class since 12th grade. Cruise may be under the impression that he\u2019s cinema\u2019s one true savior, brought to this earth to base-jump off cliffs and scale the Burj Khalifa to atone for our sins and sell seats to people who don\u2019t really go to the movies anymore. But today, based on the neon-pink evidence at Manhattan\u2019s AMC Lincoln Square, moviegoers don\u2019t want to be saved. They want to be Barbenheimed.\n\nIt\u2019s July 20, around 5:45 p.m., and everyone\u2019s here for Greta Gerwig\u2019s pink psychedelics or Christopher Nolan\u2019s movie about a man in a porkpie hat. Kathleen Mukamal is doing the double feature alone. \u201cI\u2019m the same age as Barbie, you know,\u201d she explains to me, wearing head-to-toe pink. \u201cThey say she was born months after me. I\u2019m late in \u201958. She\u2019s \u201959.\u201d Mukamal\u2019s fit matches the bandanna worn by her slayful Yorkshire terrier, Ruby, who\u2019s attending the screening with her owner. It\u2019s Oppenheimer first and then Barbie for her \u201cbecause it was just what was available,\u201d she says. \u201cI got the front seat in each row. You know, the last seats that were available.\u201d\n\nRuby and her owner, Kathleen Mukamal. Photo: Zoe Guy\n\nWhile loitering in the lobby, I\u2019m confronted by an invasion of every shade of pink \u2014 fuchsia and coral and bubblegum and ballet slipper \u2014 all marching in lockstep up the escalators leading to the second and third floors. The sea of pink makes me happy I wore my magenta short-sleeved button-down, even if the sweat I emitted on the MTA\u2019s saunalike platform is so bad that it\u2019s gonna rudely manipulate me into finally taking the 100 percent silk shirt to the dry cleaner, a task I\u2019ve managed to dodge since stealing it from my sister. If I hadn\u2019t dressed for the occasion, I would simply look bitter and unpatriotic in the face of everyone else who adhered to the dress code. No one\u2019s really dressing for Oppenheimer, as far as I can tell \u2014 except for the pair of men in blue shirts and briefcases who are running across the place at great speed, late for their screening, I suppose \u2014 but a third of the nearly two dozen people I speak with later are here for both. Maybe my pink is a force field against anyone who\u2019s just seeing Oppenheimer, unclear, but not a soul I speak to tells me they\u2019re here solely for a screening of that film. In the idle din at the moment, I overhear someone ask, \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you had fun at the movies?\u201d I can see this is the experience Cruise is probably horny for.\n\nI join the long line of people waiting to get inside the theater until I do a double take after seeing a young couple in matching Barbenheimer T-shirts. One shirt is pink and the other is black, but both share graphics with the movies in question and have Barbenheimer emblazoned in the Barbie font \u2026 or is it the Oppenheimer font? I get their attention. \u201cWe would love to talk, but we\u2019re late for our Barbie showing,\u201d the man says before I can get a good look. Being late is not an option, knowing that moviegoers paid upwards of $40 for the double feature tonight, not including their outfits, popcorn, and a drink.\n\nTaking in the scene, you don\u2019t need to be a nuclear physicist to see that Barbie is winning this theater\u2019s marketing battle and is even doing enough heavy lifting for Oppenheimer to benefit. There\u2019s a massive Barbie ad on the escalator landing. A Barbie step-and-repeat with a matching pink carpet. A life-size Barbie-doll box. Each photo opportunity offers moviegoers the chance to take commemorative pictures with their dates holding pink Barbie Corvettes and dolls purchased at the concession stand (a $64.99 bundle) in one hand and free Barbie posters in the other. Though there\u2019s nothing Oppenheimer-themed save for a poster in the dark first-floor lobby, a few people I chat with think Barbie\u2019s 18-month marketing strategy has had a Reaganomics trickle-down effect on why they\u2019re here for the bomb movie, too. \u201cI am here to see Barbenheimer,\u201d Matt tells me, wearing his ultrahigh platform heels and baby-pink Barbie tank while waiting to take pics in one of the photo ops. Why? \u201cWell, Barbie \u2019cause Barbie\u2019s everything, and Oppenheimer \u2019cause I need to know what the hype\u2019s for.\u201d Willyan Ferreira, for their part, adds that \u201cpink is a very powerful color, and so is an atomic bomb.\u201d A pink-and-blue virus has taken root here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/ 4\n\nChris, wearing a DayGlo Ken outfit, also thinks the Barbenheimer alliance is a joint slay. \u201cI actually see it as a truce,\u201d he says. His partner, Omar, sports yet another baby-pink tank, accessorized with a fuchsia bandanna around his neck. Chris continues, \u201cI think anything that encourages people to go to the movies, like, great, do more double giant releases to get people back.\u201d He\u2019s optimistic about how this model could work in cinema\u2019s favor: \u201cI feel like this is the first time since the pandemic people are really flooding the movie theaters. I was laughing, saying I feel like the staff today is going to be like, \u2018I don\u2019t even remember how to do this!\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter a bit of a dustup with an usher who\u2019s confused about why I bought a ticket for a movie I\u2019m not seeing, I\u2019m standing in the concessions area. Nearly every register is occupied to feed the masses, and the lines snake around the stanchions like a busy airport-security check. A screening of Barbie just let out, and I catch two college students from it sporting unofficial merch. Arnav Das is in a shirt featuring Ryan Gosling\u2019s Ken, and Sofia Cede\u00f1o is wearing a shirt decorated with Margot Robbie\u2019s Barbie; they tell me more merch should include T-shirts of the memes. \u201cHave you seen the picture where it\u2019s like Barbie and Oppenheimer shaking hands and then it\u2019s blowing up in the background?\u201d Cade\u00f1o asks me. I haven\u2019t seen the meme. \u201cThey are, like, facing each other. Yeah, that\u2019s the one I would want.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Zoe Guy\n\nThey leave, and I wait in line with Luna Rahzel, a cosplayer who tells me she purchased two rows \u2014 that\u2019s 22 tickets \u2014 for her and her cohort when tickets first went on sale. We make our way to the front of the line and Rahzel nabs the Corvette popcorn bucket and the Barbie-doll bundle on sale. Luckily, she\u2019s here two hours early to grab some of the clearly dwindling supply. \u201cMattel is making hand over fist on this,\u201d she jokes. \u201cWoo, late-stage capitalism!\u201d\n\nSome still seem to think Barbenheimer shouldn\u2019t have declared a truce. Beth Slade, Hayden Murphy, and Caileigh Potter are \u201cabsolutely not\u201d here for Nolan. \u201cWhat are you going to wear to it? Black?\u201d Potter wonders. \u201cI don\u2019t want to watch people get blown up. The world is dark enough as it is. I want to watch some joy, some pink, something silly, maybe cry a little bit, but in a fun, lighthearted way that\u2019s nostalgic.\u201d Skylar Theis, who will actually see both films, nails it: \u201cShe\u2019s everything; he\u2019s just Oppenheimer.\u201d"

    "text": "Large crowds packing cinemas for Barbie and Oppenheimer could spark another COVID surge, a top virology professor has warned.\n\nDr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine and noted advocate for strong measures against COVID infections, admitted his warning would not be well received.\n\n'Not to be a Debbie Downer\u2026but anyone worried about a post-Barbie Box Office Covid bump? Or post-Oppie?' he asked his 465,000 Twitter followers.\n\n'We'll probably never know since no one seems to be keeping track of such things anymore. Keep up with your boosters and find a pink N-95 or KN-95 if you can.'\n\nDr. Peter Hotez said he knew he was being a 'Debbie Downer,' but warned people to take care if they were packing cinemas to see Barbie or Oppenheimer\n\nBarbie, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, is the biggest film opening so far this year\n\nOppenheimer, starring Cillian Murphy, has also drawn large crowds to movie theatres\n\nBoth films opened this weekend to widespread acclaim and large crowds.\n\nBarbie was the biggest opening of the year, with $162 million at the box office, while Oppenheimer took $82 million.\n\nThe surge in cinema attendance comes as COVID hospitalization rates trended slightly up last week but remained massively below their levels of even a year ago.\n\nIn the week of July 15, a total nationwide of 7,109 people were admitted to the hospital with COVID. By comparison, this week last year saw 45,000 people admitted.\n\nHotez made headlines in June when Democrat long-shot presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a noted anti-vaxxer, challenged the doctor to a debate on Joe Rogan's podcast.\n\nThat led Rogan, too, to challenge Hotez to a debate.\n\nHotez said he would happily appear on Rogan's show, but would not engage in a circus fight with Kennedy.\n\nThe suggestion of a Hotez-Kennedy debate sparked an online frenzy, and saw Hotez challenged at his home by Alex Rosen, a self-proclaimed 'independent journalist' who works for a site called 'Predator Poachers.'\n\nRosen, after exchanging pleasantries, asked Hotez why he wouldn't debate Kennedy.\n\n'Aw come on, that's harassing,' Hotez replied.\n\n'I'm just curious, nothing hostile, just curious,' responded Rosen.\n\nHotez says he's been stalked outside his home, as one right-wing commentator posted a video confronting him\n\nHotez said he hadn't made a decision, saying Rogan 'just invited me, so we'll see. We'll give it some thought.'\n\nAfter repeating he felt Hotez should debate, Rosen asked: 'What do you say to people who think they're vaccine injured?'\n\nHotez, clearly perturbed, began to close his gate and started to walk away from Rosen.\n\n'Ugh I just was stalked in front of my home by a couple of anti-vaxers taunting me to debate RFK Jr,' he tweeted.\n\n'Of course I was looking my Sunday best in our brutal heat wave. What is it with people?'\n\nKennedy in the interview on Rogan's podcast repeated his debunked claims that common childhood vaccines cause autism, which Hotez called 'just awful'.\n\nHotez added: 'It's clear many actually believe this nonsense.'\n\nRogan fired back with a challenge: 'Peter, if you claim what RFK Jr. is saying is 'misinformation' I am offering you $100,000.00 to the charity of your choice if you're willing to debate him on my show with no time limit.'\n\nRogan's interview with Kennedy drew backlash from Hotez who objected to vaccine concerns calling it 'just awful' as he lamented 'it's clear many actually believe this nonsense.'\n\nRFK Jr. appeared on Rogan's podcast, repeating his debunked claims that common childhood vaccines cause autism\n\nIn multiple tweets, Hotez indicated his willingness to appear on Rogan's podcast, which reaches a massive audience of millions on Spotify.\n\n'I'm happy to come on and have a meaningful discussion. I respect you and your show and I don't want an adversarial relationship. I think we can make some progress,' tweeted Hotez.\n\n'And I'm open to a number of different options, but to be pressured to give you an answer on Twitter, now, with a 'take it or leave it' demand that's not how I work. Honestly, I don't even think that would be in your best interests,' he wrote.\n\nKennedy also indicated his willingness to engage, tweeting: 'Peter. Let's finally have the respectful, congenial, informative debate that the American people deserve.'"

    "text": "The Barbenheimer phenomenon is almost certainly the most obnoxiously contrived and contrivedly obnoxious show business event since the day Danny Snyder pretended to put his wife in charge of the Washington Commanders. Everyone connected with this cynical combo plate, from filmmakers through actors, reviewers through moviegoers, deserve all the eye, skin, and social diseases one can get from trying to cut in on the latest trend in cultural death. Maybe that's just because your author seems to have other things to do when every movie in the world plays.\n\nBut because of an editor who will remain nameless even though it is that bastard Petchesky, Barbenheimer in the theater it had to be, upon which two things became clear.\n\nIf you watched Barbie before Oppenheimer as your victimized typist did, you got the order wrong. Barbie is simply a spoiler alert for our post-apocalyptic future, and in that context Oppenheimer merely becomes the turgid tale of a self-absorbed and smug power nerd who didn't make enough bombs to avert the future that included Barbie. Everybody with an opinion about this hype-powered combo-dirigible has already given it, and the verdict is in\u2014they're both movies. Taken individually, they have that certain indefinable je ne sais blah, but rammed together they are famous for simply making no thematic sense as a pairing, forcing otherwise borderline decent people to compare blancmange and concrete because some death-warrants-with-marketing-degrees decreed it shall be an \"event.\" The wolverines who lunched up this twin monstrosity bought time, space, and bandwidth anywhere that accepted free content or ad money, found that news organizations are desperate to avoid all forms of work, and therefore hook/line/sinkered the whole mess, just to show their bosses they could.\n\nBarbie was, of course, all about the marketing, and in our theater (name withheld to keep the lawyers caged), the number of elderly folks dressed like Barbie and Ken reminded us yet again to see the good side of the planet being baked into oblivion by global warming. Even the restaurant adjacent to our local theater made its workers dress as Barbie characters (not hard, as most of the characters are either Barbie or Ken, and nobody is dressing up like Rhea Perlman) and offered up menu choices like Barbie Malibu (coconut rum infused with bubble gum extract, for the professional diabetic in your life) and Radioactive Deviled Eggs (probably an Oppenheimer reference but one can\u2019t be certain).\n\nThe warmup act for Barbie was a couple of preteen girls either employed or dragooned to play a song (electric ukulele, to give you an idea) in a burst of reimagined vaudeville that can best be explained by the deathless phrase, \"This is a song we wrote last week, and I think it's the best song we've ever done.\" That seems a safe enough bet, and the polite army of Barbie impersonators in the audience applauded their courage.\n\nThe fact that nobody dressed up as Robert Oppenheimer at Movie Night, or really at any time since 1962, isn't the point. It's that cinematic polar opposites were shotgun-married to fake a weekend outing at the services of the Mattel Corporation and the wheezing movie industry.\n\nIt was a good weekend for box offices, (an estimated $155M for Barbs, $80M for Oppy), but how about the films? Your misshapen stenographer is not a movie critic and would rather become a narcotics informer than begin now, but you're paying for halfwit opinions, so here's another: Meh. Barbie plays out as if it were imagined by Joseph Stalin, Sofia Vergara, Brian Wilson, and a closet of crank-fueled HGTV showrunners, while Oppenheimer plays out as Stalin's breakout solo project. Either way, the villains (Lewis Strauss v. Ryan Gosling-Ken) are the same guy, and the heroes (Ruth Handler vs. Kitty Oppenheimer) aren't on long enough. And like most movies, the universal takeaway here is that the old adage, \"Always leave them wanting less,\" wins again. In this case the \"less\" in question is about 25 minutes of each, or the time of the average moviehouse nap, which your author successfully executed right about the time Matt Damon shows up as Sympathetic Careerist Colonel Pain In The Ass. No plot points were missed.\n\nBarbie decidedly began as more fun, Oppenheimer profoundly more dismal, and while after a clever run-up (hey, it's Helen Mirren!) Barbie got grimmer as the plot dumbed itself down for the required 10th-grade-level back-end movie lecture, Oppenheimer's lead in soul-crushing moroseness was too much to overcome. Then again, Oppenheimer was supposed to be Lars von Trier\u2013level bleak, so in that way I guess it wins this match that should never have been made.\n\nThat's the real takeaway from the two films if, like us, you prefer people make their own judgments about their entertainment and then do the rest of the party the great courtesy of keeping their opinions to themselves. Both movies in their mashup form, after four Empress and tonics, two Angry Orchard ciders, and five or eight glasses of wine, seem to be treatises on America's polarities of institutionalized despair. No, your perturbed reviewer did not order all those himself. This is important for you to know because (a) no single person could drink that much and not breathalyze a night in the can, and (b) to let the kids in Defector Accounting know that they are on the hook for three dinners, six tickets, and all the alcohol. Yep, you sent us to the movies and we made it cost about three bills. Next time, you'll think a little harder about both the financial and psychic cost of such assignments. We could sit through Oppenheimer one more time at home if only to see what we missed during the nap, but Barbie is a one-off, as it was meant to be.\n\nIn other words, this entire mudslide of a weekend is now over and never to be referenced again. Even if the studios want to try this gambit again (imagine remakes of La La Land and The Killing Fields played for a film class at Northwestern with students powered by four hours' sleep and three gallons of Fireball), it will be hard to imagine us lurching at this particular hook ever again. After all, once is slightly forced weirdness, but twice is a week's worth of ESPN programming streamed on a perpetual loop, and absolutely nobody needs that. Plus, we intend to beat up the nameless editor who is still that worm Petchesky and abandon him in the New Hampshire woods. Now there's the happy ending we're all looking for."

    "text": "\u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d the simultaneous July 21 release of Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cBarbie\u201d and Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d turned a meme into the most widely anticipated cinematic event of the year. The films\u2019 contrasting aesthetics have been fodder for jokes, photo edits and themed outfits. Fans have been delighting in their favorite filmmakers going head-to-head, pitting pitch black against bubblegum pink.\n\nThe whole thing is funny, if you are able to differentiate the film \u201cOppenheimer\u201d from its real world inspiration, but that line has definitely blurred. When a \u201cBarbie house\u201d appeared in Malibu as a promotion for the film, the internet was quick to joke that the Oppenheimer team would nuke it for their own marketing campaign.\n\nBarbie and Oppenheimer are both trying to stop the destruction of their own worlds.\n\nThe films\u2019 apparent incongruity created a farcical pairing that busted the box office. Tens of thousands of people bought same-day tickets for both \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and \u201cBarbie,\u201d watching them as a double feature. In their first weekend, \u201cOppenheimer\u201d grossed $82.4 million and \u201cBarbie\u201d a whopping $155 million at the domestic box office\u2014becoming the biggest-ever opening box office for a film directed by a woman. What fans who saw both didn\u2019t expect was how well the apparent opposites thematically complement each other.\n\nFor all their differences, Barbenheimer has some genuine thematic throughlines. Lynda Carter, the actress most famous for her portrayal of a super-Barbie role in the 1970s Wonder Woman show, brilliantly observed that \u201cBarbie lives in the world Oppenheimer made.\u201d That is undeniably true. Barbie was first created in the late 1950s, the most nuclear-haunted time of world history, which was also the pinnacle of the post-war consumer boom. \u201cBarbie\u201d may have been a reaction to the post-war restoration of traditional gender roles, when the G.I. Kens came back from the war and Rosie the Riveters were kicked out of the shipyards and sent back to the kitchens.\n\nPerhaps the most striking example was the ending of the free child care programs the federal government had created to accommodate so many mothers going to build planes, tanks and ships. It was an intentional move to get women back into the home. This is almost exactly what occurs in \u201cBarbie,\u201d when Ken returns from the \u201creal world\u201d enamored of patriarchy and ready to introduce traditional gender roles in the Barbieland utopia.\n\nThe actress Lynda Carter brilliantly observed that \u201cBarbie lives in the world Oppenheimer made.\u201d\n\nBoth films dig into titular characters uncomfortable with their own legacies. This may seem an odd comparison. After all, J. Robert Oppenheimer created the atomic bomb, and Barbie is a plastic doll. But both created (and are creations of) their particular moments of American history\u2014moments whose legacies we are still dealing with today.\n\nBarbie takes her legacy very seriously. In the film, all the Barbies in Barbieland think they have solved all the world\u2019s problems for women, but as soon as she enters the real world, a girl accuses Barbie of fascism, stating she makes women feel bad about themselves and displays unrealistic beauty standards. Barbie weeps at this criticism. In a speech intended to celebrate the bomb\u2019s use, Oppenheimer envisions the bomb\u2019s destruction in an incinerated skeleton and a woman with flaking skin. Neither Oppenheimer nor Barbie really understands that they\u2019ve done anything wrong until they confront the effects of their actions. They are both haunted by unintended consequences and wrestle with the fact that many people do not like or approve of them.\n\nTaken together, Barbenheimer is a scathing indictment of life in a man\u2019s world.\n\nNeither character directly apologizes or asks for forgiveness, and neither can truly dismantle the damage they have done. Yet they both try to distance themselves from their pasts. Oppenheimer, in real life and in the film, continues to work in nuclear science but becomes opposed to further nuclear proliferation and the brewing arms race with the Soviets. Meanwhile, Barbie works to let go of the perfectionism that plagues her and her legacy. They are both seeking penance, but neither truly believes they are deserving of forgiveness. Barbie\u2019s fears are met with kindness: Gloria, the woman who brought Barbie to the real world, reassures her: \u201cYou are so beautiful and so smart, and it kills me that you don\u2019t think you\u2019re good enough.\u201d Oppenheimer\u2019s wife confirms his fears: \u201cYou think because you let them tar and feather you that the world will forgive you? They won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nTaken together, Barbenheimer is a scathing indictment of life in a man\u2019s world. Barbie is overt in its criticism of the patriarchy, even if delivering it within a satire. The male-dominated \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is a little more subtextual. No women are in the rooms where it is decided to drop the bombs that kill between 129,000 and 226,000 people. U.S. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson jokes he doesn\u2019t want to drop the bomb on Kyoto because he honeymooned there. Nolan uses this moment to underline how out of touch these powerful men are with the reality of what they are doing. Oppenheimer says he lost his faith in the project when he realized that anything he built would be used against our enemies in war. Barbie and Oppenheimer did not choose how the world reacted to them, but there were real-world consequences whether intended or not.\n\nBarbie and Oppenheimer also both deal with existential dread. They question the meaning of death and wrestle with the sanctity of life. Oppenheimer is utilitarian in his thinking about the bomb until it is used. He justifies its creation by saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know if we can be trusted with such a weapon. But I know the Nazis can\u2019t.\u201d But by the time the bomb is built, the Nazis had already been defeated. And though the bombs may have hastened the end of the war, he cannot help feeling he has blood on his hands. Barbie feels the sanctity of her own life as she steps into what it means to be human, mortal and imperfect. These two people didn\u2019t mean to be more than they are. He just wanted to be a physicist, and she just wants to be a woman.\n\nBarbie and Oppenheimer are both trying to stop the destruction of their own worlds. Oppenheimer seems resigned to the fact that the damage is done and nuclear war is inevitable. Barbie is hopeful that things can and will change for the better. They make a much more thought-provoking pairing than a mere internet meme could convey. The juxtaposition of masculine and feminine, destruction and creation, dread and hope, may leave moviegoers thinking a little harder about their own place in the world."

    "text": "As our team scoped the timepieces of everyone involved in the films and promotional tours, Tag Heuer and Hamilton were the clear winners: they were almost the only watch brands present in Barbie and Oppenheimer, respectively.\n\nThe much-anticipated simultaneous release of blockbuster films Barbie and Oppenheimer on July 21 finally brought the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d movement to a crescendo. The tongue-in-cheek portmanteau refers to the entertaining duality between the bubblegum celebration of Mattel\u2019s iconic doll and the grim ethical and historical overtones from the story of the father of the atomic bomb.\n\nWhile perhaps not quite a thematic Barbenheimer equivalent in the watch world, it\u2019s still interesting to see references from both watch houses appearing on the silver screen and red carpet, thanks to the brands\u2019 partnerships with the films\u2019 cast members.\n\nSpoilers ahead as we check out the timepieces from Barbie and Oppenheimer!\n\nTag Heuer x Barbie\n\nRyan Gosling leads a show-stopping musical number in Barbie. Photo: Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nIt should be far from surprising that Ryan Gosling\u2019s ambassadorship with Tag Heuer made its way into the movie as Beach Ken wrestled with the gender role reversal he experienced in reality vs Barbieland.\n\nKen bringing patriarchy \u2013 and plenty of horses \u2013 to Barbieland was a sour note in the second act of the film, but it did give us Gosling in a fur coat along with several pairs of shades and no less than three different vintage Heuer Carrera chronographs on his wrists at the same time, as reported by Hodinkee.\n\nTwo of the three Heuer Carreras that Ryan Gosling\u2019s Ken wore in Barbie. Photos: Handout\n\nThe pieces themselves are from the 1960s and 70s, from before Heuer was bought by the Tag racing company and a few years after the original Ken was introduced in 1961. However, we surmise that the watches were chosen not so much for their horological significance (all three are seminal pieces in Heuer\u2019s history of chronographs) but for the sheer golden decadence the pieces exude.\n\nRyan Gosling at Canadian promotions for Barbie, sporting a pink Tag Heuer Carrera Date 36mm. Photo: Getty Images\n\nTo cap it all off, Gosling sported a more modern, pink Tag Heuer Carrera Date 36mm in Toronto for the Canadian leg of promotions, in contrast with his pastel blue and pink suit, per media reports.\n\nHamilton x Oppenheimer\n\nOppenheimer was written and directed by Christopher Nolan. Photo: Universal Pictures\n\nThe temptation to label Tag Heuer x Hamilton the Barbenheimer of watches this summer is strong, but even though both films tapped long-standing partnerships to source three vintage references from the respective brands for the screen, the similarities end there.\n\nHamilton vintage pieces worn by Cillian Murphy in Oppenheimer, from left to right: Cushion B, Lexington and Endicott. Photo: Hamilton\n\nSeasoned director Christopher Nolan tapped his long-standing relationship with Hamilton to source vintage pieces for the biopic on J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb played by Cillian Murphy.\n\nThe film comprises interwoven scenes from Oppenheimer\u2019s early life and career, his work with the Manhattan Project in the 1940s developing the atomic bomb, and subsequent security hearings in the 1950s with Congress and the United States Atomic Energy Commission regarding suspected Communist leanings and his clearance to work on atomic weapons.\n\nMatt Damon wore Hamilton pieces as lieutenant general Leslie Jones in Oppenheimer: left, the Military Ordonance and right, the Piping Rock. Photo: Hamilton\n\nMurphy sported the period-appropriate Cushion B two-handed 1930s piece alongside the black-dialled Lexington and golden Endicott, both with sub-seconds dials and from the 1940s, the brand confirmed.\n\nEmily Blunt , who plays Kitty Oppenheimer, sports the discreet Lady Hamilton A-2 in a square case with gold-coloured indices and hands; while Matt Damon, as lieutenant general Leslie Groves, wears the Piping Rock and Military Ordonance \u2013 both quintessential pieces for military men during the period.\n\nHamilton Khaki Field \u201cMurph\u201d 38mm, inspired by the unique version of the Khaki Field Auto from Christopher Nolan\u2019s 2014 film Interstellar. Photo: Hamilton\n\nNolan\u2019s relationship with Hamilton is well-known \u2013 as is his tendency to play with the concept of time in his films. Hamilton provided a version of the Khaki Navy BelowZero for his 2020 feature Tenet.\n\nBut his most famous collaboration with the brand was its unique design for the Hamilton Khaki Field. The subsequent significance of the watch to the plot of his 2014 hit Interstellar resulted in the release of the Hamilton Khaki Field Murph 42mm in 2019, per the brand. The latter most recently received a refresh in 38mm in 2022."

    "text": "This summer\u2019s biggest movie releases brought us \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d a real-life thriller about a weapon that could save and possibly destroy humanity, and \u201cBarbie,\u201d a musical comedy about a doll that thinks she\u2019s solved but actually set back equal rights.\n\nWhile some people have turned the movies into a double-feature, my version of Barbenheimer pairs \u201cBarbie\u201d with \u201cMild Vertigo,\u201d a newly translated Japanese novel. I haven\u2019t come up with a cute mashup name for these two works that dig into the paradoxes of being a woman. (No spoilers ahead for either film or the book.)\n\n\u201cMild Vertigo\u201d is narrated by Natsumi, a stay-at-home mom tending to her apartment in Tokyo. We hear voices of neighbors gossiping over the minute differences in the neighborhoods\u2019 apartments A-F. We hear the chatter of birds outside the windows and from Natsumi\u2019s past. And we hear her thoughts, a running commentary of the minutiae in her boring life. What to buy. How to clean. Her days are nothing and everything.\n\nHer stream of consciousness with sentences stretching several pages reminds me of modernist writers like Gertrude Stein from a century ago. Mieko Kanai wrote \u201cMild Vertigo\u201d in 1997. The English translation was released this spring, leaving me wondering what\u2019s really changed \u2014 not stylistically, but the subtext.\n\nAs I write this, I heard the chime of Beepy, the robot vacuum, and paused to empty it and saw the swim bag next to the trashcan and made sure it has my daughter\u2019s swimsuit, the one with long sleeves to protect her from the sun, and water shoes and sunscreen for today\u2019s swim class. (Will it be canceled because there\u2019s a 60% chance of rain? How will the teacher reach out about a cancellation? We\u2019ve emailed but does she check her email often? Can she check it when she spends her day in the pool?) Should I roast some vegetables now when nobody\u2019s in the hot kitchen and was this vacuum a stupid splurge even if it was a Prime Day deal and that review site said it was good and it has cleaned more than any adult has in a while and why do people care about how clean a floor is? Do I care about the people who do care?\n\nNatsumi\u2019s banal narrative exposes what\u2019s beneath the performance of life, maintaining appearances.\n\nIn \u201cBarbie,\u201d the Barbies rule and run Barbieland. They can do anything so they do everything. Their days may not be filled with keeping house and caregiving but they\u2019re still Sisyphean.\n\n\u201cThis is the best day ever. So was yesterday and so is tomorrow and every day from now until forever,\u201d says stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) during a fabulously sparkly choreographed dance.\n\nHer day is just like how kids play. No water in the shower or milk in the carton. No need to walk down the stairs when you can float down to the ground for a fun day at the beach. Her days are nothing and everything. When things start to change, Barbie wants nothing more than a normal day that ends, as every day ends, with a girls night.\n\nKenergy aside, a pivotal moment in \u201cBarbie\u201d is the monologue of Gloria (America Ferrera) about the ridiculousness of the double standards woman juggle. The original monologue was written by director Greta Gerwig with notes from Ferrera and took almost 30 takes to capture.\n\nIt\u2019s a message that has brought viewers to tears and in the film, inspired stereotypical Barbie out of her hopelessness into action.\n\n\u201cBy giving voice to the cognitive dissonance required to be a woman under the patriarchy, you robbed it of its power,\u201d Barbie says.\n\nThese two works give a voice to what\u2019s unsaid: the unrealistic expectations, the mental labor of caregiving, the adjustments under the gaze. Perhaps they\u2019re real-life thrillers about something that could save humanity."

Sign up here for the \u20185 Things\u2019 newsletter.\n\nThe weekend that was\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s the summer\u2019s biggest weekend at the movies, with the release of Christopher Nolan\u2019s historical epic \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and Greta Gerwig\u2019s technicolor \u201cBarbie.\u201d The films have inspired a double feature craze, which could drive the best box office weekend in years.\n\n\u2022 Alabama GOP Gov. Kay Ivey approved a new congressional map with just one majority-Black district, despite a court order calling for the redrawn lines to create two majority-Black districts or \u201csomething quite close to it.\u201d The map must now be approved by a federal court.\n\n\u2022 Authorities in Mexico say they have arrested a man suspected of intentionally setting a bar on fire after being kicked out, killing 11 people near the Arizona border in the Mexican state of Sonora. A 17-year-old and a female American citizen were among those killed.\n\n\u2022 A large wildfire tearing through the Greek island of Rhodes has forced thousands of tourists to evacuate their hotels, officials say. The fire is the largest of a number of blazes in Greece, which is sweltering under a lengthy heat wave.\n\n\u2022 Legendary singer Tony Bennett, best known for \u201cI Left My Heart in San Francisco,\u201d died at age 96. In a career spanning eight decades, Bennett wowed Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra, performed live on MTV, had a cartoon cameo on \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and won 19 Grammy Awards.\n\nThe week ahead\n\nMonday\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken will begin a trip to Tonga, New Zealand and Australia to discuss regional security and cooperation in the Pacific region. Blinken also will cheer on the US Women\u2019s National Team at the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup.\n\nWednesday\n\nFederal Reserve policymakers will wrap up their two-day meeting on interest rates, and another hike is widely expected. The central bank took a pause in June after 10 straight rate hikes, but another increase has already been baked in by most economists. The bigger question though is whether the Fed will raise rates again at its next meeting in September in order to get them over with as soon as possible. The prior string of 10 consecutive increases helped drive mortgage rates to near 7% earlier this month \u2014 the highest level since November 2022.\n\nHunter Biden is scheduled to plead guilty to two tax misdemeanors at a court hearing in Delaware. Last week, the House Oversight Committee heard testimony from two IRS whistleblowers who claim the Justice Department politicized the criminal probe of the president\u2019s son, alleging that IRS investigators recommended charging him with far more serious crimes.\n\nAnd a House subcommittee will hold a hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena \u2014 or what most people outside of government circles call UFOs. The hearing will explore firsthand accounts of such phenomena and assess the federal government\u2019s transparency and accountability regarding possible threats to national security.\n\nThursday\n\nThe Commerce Department will release its first of three reports on the state of the economy for the second quarter. Gross domestic product \u2014 the broadest measure of economic output in the US \u2014 rose by an annualized rate of 2% in the first quarter, coming in higher than the agency\u2019s previous estimates. The final Q1 reading showed Americans spending less on goods and more on services such as health care.\n\nOne Thing: Why this heat wave is different\n\nIn this week\u2019s One Thing podcast, CNN chief climate correspondent Bill Weir explains what makes this worldwide heat wave so dangerous and how communities are adapting.

    "text": "There are two new wide or semi-wide releases this weekend, \u201cThe Last Voyage of the Demeter\u201d and \u201cJules,\u201d but how many moviegoers will actually buy tickets with so many other stronger contenders still in theaters? Read on for Gold Derby\u2019s box office preview.\n\nBefore we get to the new movies this week, we probably should address the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d in the room. There\u2019s very little doubt that \u201cBarbie\u201d can pull off a rare fourth weekend at #1 with upwards of $32 million or more after holding up so well against \u201cMeg 2\u201d and the \u201cNinja Turtles\u201d this past weekend. Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer\u201d also has a good chance at reclaiming second place, since it\u2019s likely to have a smaller drop-off this weekend than both of last week\u2019s new movies.\n\nSEE Box office: \u2018Barbie\u2019 crosses $400 million mark in less than 3 weeks\n\n\u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\u201d was just two million behind \u201cMeg 2: The Trench\u201d over the weekend but received much better reviews and a higher CinemaScore, so we can probably expect it to hold up better and take third place, leaving fourth place for \u201cMeg 2.\u201d\n\nThat brings us to the first of the new wide releases, and that is Universal Pictures\u2019 \u201cThe Last Voyage of the Demeter,\u201d directed by Andr\u00e9 \u00d8vredal (\u201cScary Stories to Tell in the Dark\u201d). It\u2019s based on the section of Bram Stoker\u2019s \u201cDracula\u201d where the vampire travels by ship from Romania to England to continue his reign of terror. In this case, Dracula (or \u201cNosferatu,\u201d going by the 1922 silent classic starring Max Schreck) is played by creature performer and actor Javier Botet.\n\nThe crew of the Demeter \u2013 that\u2019s the name of the ship \u2013 includes Corey Hawkins from \u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d as a British doctor hoping to get a trip back home, while the captain is played by veteran actor Liam Cunningham (\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d) and his young son is played by Woody Norman (\u201cC\u2019mon C\u2019mon\u201d). Other known names and/or faces include David Dastmalchian (\u201cAnt-Man,\u201d \u201cThe Boogeyman\u201d) as the ship\u2019s first mate and Irish-Italian actress Aisling Franciosi (also \u201cGoT\u201d) as a stowaway.\n\nWhile the movie definitely has the Dracula thing going for it and being dark horror by a fairly well-respected genre filmmaker like \u00d8vredal, it\u2019s also a period gothic horror film, which tend to be a tougher sell to American audiences. Case in point: 2012\u2019s \u201cThe Woman in Black,\u201d starring Daniel Radcliffe, opened shortly after the end of his \u201cHarry Potter\u201d run with $20.9 million in early February; its 2015 sequel sans Radcliffe earned roughly half the original film\u2019s domestic take. The 2018 gothic horror film \u201cWinchester\u201d (also from the now defunct CBS Films) opened on the same weekend as \u201cWoman in Black\u201d with just $9.3 million and grossed less than $46 million worldwide.\n\nSEE Grab the popcorn and sound off in our movie forums\n\nEarlier this year, the Dracula horror-comedy spin-off \u201cRenfield,\u201d starring Nicholas Hoult and Nicolas Cage as Dracula, bombed quite badly, opening with just $8 million, so it\u2019s odd for Universal to be releasing another Dracula spin-off (essentially) so soon.\n\nThere\u2019s a good chance that a movie like \u201cDemeter\u201d can do well in European and other international countries, but Universal is only opening the movie in roughly 2,600 North American theaters, maybe realizing it would be a tougher sell. Reviews (which won\u2019t hit until Thursday) probably won\u2019t be so kind for various reasons I won\u2019t break embargo to share, but those things alone might keep \u201cThe Last Voyage of the Demeter\u201d from opening over $10 million. Because of that, it\u2019s likely to open in fifth place behind last week\u2019s rejiggered top four.\n\nFilmmaker Marc Turtletaub, who received an Oscar nomination for producing \u201cLittle Miss Sunshine,\u201d directs \u201cJules,\u201d a smaller indie comedy starring Sir Ben Kingsley as a small-town Pennsylvania resident who encounters an alien after his craft crash lands in his garden. Bleecker Street Films will be releasing the movie moderately wide on Friday, also in an attempt to try to grab older adult business away from \u201cOppenheimer\u201d mostly.\n\nSEE 2023 box office hits: Every movie that made more than $100 million\n\nTurtletaub previously directed the Sundance drama \u201cPuzzle,\u201d starring Kelly McDonald and late Bollywood great Irrfan Khan, but that movie didn\u2019t even make $2.3 million worldwide, which is not a good sign that the producer of so many huge hits picks the best material to direct. (Turtletaub previously wrote \u201cGods Behaving Badly\u201d and two short films, but he didn\u2019t write either of his most recent features.)\n\nAlthough Kingsley probably has a decent draw with older audiences, as does his co-star, Jane Curtin, a veteran from the early days of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d there\u2019s no theater count reported for \u201cJules,\u201d as of this writing. Without having a presence in more than 1,000 theaters, there\u2019s no guarantee this can even get into the Top 10, making something closer to the $2 million opening for the Bleecker Street release \u201cMafia Mamma\u201d earlier this year, but probably less.\n\nAlso, Cohen Media Group will give a platform release to Juliet Binoche\u2019s latest film \u201cBetween Two Worlds,\u201d directed by Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re. Check back on Sunday to see if the new movies fare better against the late summer blockbusters.\n\nSIGN UP for Gold Derby\u2019s free newsletter with latest predictions"

They should welcome some preemptive action.\u201d\n\nIn pushing to delay any conversion of the AMC Preferred Equity units, or APEs, Izzo is seeking to capitalize on Vice Chancellor Morgan T. Zurn\u2019s ruling rejecting the original version of the settlement, which stunned analysts July 21, scrambling the trading positions of arbitragers betting on the conversion. The decision sent AMC common stock surging and the preferred units plunging.\n\nHollywood Strikes, \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019\n\nIzzo is one of the nearly 3,000 retail investors\u2014many of them participants in the \u201cmeme stock\u201d rally that saved the company from a pandemic-era bankruptcy\u2014who wrote to the court to oppose the settlement. The deal, announced in April, has fluctuated in value within the $110 million to $120 million range, depending on AMC\u2019s stock price.\n\nShe\u2019s the only one who showed up at a June court hearing with an attorney to formally object. Her lawyer, Ted Kittila, has said he\u2019s ready to take over the case, scuttle the agreement, and resume the court fight on behalf of investors who feel \u201cstabbed in the back\u201d by the company and the shareholders that negotiated the deal.\n\nZurn\u2019s surprise ruling rejecting the settlement was a relatively narrow one. She turned the deal down over provisions\u2014which she had flagged at the hearing three weeks earlier\u2014that waived any claims by common stockholders, including those involving APEs they might also hold. State corporate laws require such releases to work on a share-by-share rather than investor-by-investor basis, the judge said.\n\nAMC and the lead shareholders swiftly filed a revised settlement aimed at addressing those concerns, and Zurn agreed within days to resume weighing the agreement without offering investors a new opportunity to object. Both sides stressed in court papers the importance of a ruling in the first half of August, \u201cbefore the capital markets go quiet\u201d until after Labor Day.\n\nThe company\u2019s filing described Hollywood\u2019s ongoing labor strikes as a \u201cserious threat,\u201d echoing a July 23 open letter from CEO Adam Aron stating that AMC\u2019s \u201crisk of financial collapse is not whimsical.\u201d The theater chain has since been buoyed by the simultaneous blockbusters.\n\nPlaying Coy\n\nIzzo, meanwhile, has sought to ensure that her channels of appeal remain open if Zurn signs off on the revised settlement. Letting the APE conversion go through while the state\u2019s top court is considering the case would \u201cfrustrate appellate review,\u201d according to her court filing Tuesday.\n\n\u201cClawing back the settlement consideration following a successful appeal may be impossible,\u201d Izzo said. She also pointed to the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d revenues AMC is now enjoying. \u201cThe parties play coy as to why disaster is closer now,\u201d following \u201cunrelenting positive news,\u201d the filing said.\n\nAlso Tuesday, another shareholder leading a separate lawsuit against AMC\u2014one that would force the company to hold its first annual meeting and board election since June 2022\u2014accused the company of stalling on an expedited hearing date. \u201cThis matter can and should be set for a hearing in August,\u201d he said.\n\nIzzo is represented by is represented by Halloran Farkas & Kittila LLP. AMC is represented by Richards, Layton & Finger PA and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP. Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann LLP, Grant & Eisenhofer PA, Fields Kupka & Shukurov LLP, and Saxena White PA are counsel for the pension fund and investor leading the litigation.\n\nThe cases are In re AMC Ent.

    "text": "After three weekends in theaters, Greta Gerwig\u2019s \"Barbie\" surpassed the $1 billion mark in global ticket sales. Gerwig became the highest grossing female director of all time, breaking a record previously held by Patty Jenkins, director of \"Wonder Woman.\"\n\nThe highly anticipated paranoia thriller, \"Oppenheimer\" was directed by Christopher Nolan and released the same weekend as \"Barbie.\" The two films collectively generated $244.5 million in North American ticket sales their opening weekend in theaters. \u201cBarbie\u201d brought in $162 million, followed by \u201cOppenheimer\u201d at $82.5 million.\n\nThe Margot Robbie-led and produced film has been comfortably seated in first place since the film's release on July 21.\n\nMovie ticket sales are crawling back to pre-pandemic levels\n\nAccording to The Numbers, a publicly available database of movie industry statistics, annual tickets sold for 2023 are expected to reach 922 million. That's compared to 2022, where total tickets sold reached 709 million. While 2023 ticket sales are not expected to surpass 2019\u2019s pre-pandemic levels of 1.2 billion, they\u2019re inching closer, partially in service to the global sensation that is \"Barbenheimer.\"\n\nShawn Robbins, chief analyst at Box Office Pro, said \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" drove a huge social conversation that went above and beyond the internet. The meme of \"Barbenheimer\" caught wildfire, Robbins said. \u201cEverybody heard about it, and everybody outside of movie circles has been talking about it for the last few weeks.\u201d The cultural phenomenon drove non-moviegoers to the theaters, breaking significant box-office records.\n\nTheater-etiquette:Bad behavior in blockbusters sparks discussion\n\nThe 'Barbenheimer\u2019 phenomenon:How a movie meme inspired the 'crazy, weird' double feature\n\n'Barbie' smashes box office records\n\nWhile \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\u201d is currently the highest-grossing movie of 2023 sitting at $1.35 billion, \u201cBarbie\u201d is projected to beat that record. \u201cBarbie\u201d not only had the biggest opening weekend of 2023, but it was also the biggest opening weekend for any movie directed by a woman.\n\nDomestic box-office sales for \"Barbie\" and \u201cOppenheimer,\" combined were the fourth largest of all time for an opening weekend. The only bigger opening movie weekends were for \u201cAvengers,\" \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" or \u201cStar Wars\u201d films.\n\n\"Barbie\" had the biggest opening week in history of any Warner Bros. film, raking in more than half a billion dollars.\n\n\u201cBarbie stands out as one of the very few female-centric, female-targeted blockbusters of the summer,\u201d said Robbins. \"The movie offered something fresh in a summer that\u2019s been jam-packed with franchise sequels.\"\n\nYoung people are driving a movie-theater comeback\n\nWhile movie ticket sales and box office numbers are not back to pre-pandemic levels, industry data shows that young people are behind the growing market of moviegoers. About 80% of the \"Barbie\" audience was younger than 35. And 65% of the audience was female, according to data from Box Office Pro.\n\n\u201cThe audience driving this rebound has been young.\u201d Robbins said. He pointed to \u201cSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\u201d as an example of a film playing well to a younger audience.\n\nThe year-to-date domestic box office recently crossed the $6 billion mark. The last time this mark was hit in summer was in early July 2019, according to data shared by Robbins.\n\nBut keep in mind, with screenwriters and actors on strike, the movie industry is destined to feel the impact of delayed and or canceled production."

    "text": "Update, July 24: The final numbers are in, and they\u2019re huge: Barbie wound up earning $162 million domestic, with Oppenheimer coming in at $82.5 million. Internationally, Barbie made $194.3 million, with Oppenheimer earning $98 million. Math is hard, but let\u2019s just say that\u2019s a lot of money.\n\nThe original story continues below.\n\nFor weeks now, movie pundits have wondered just how much money Barbie and Oppenheimer would make on their combined opening weekend. As of Sunday, we have the answer: enough to buy a lot of Dreamhouses (and/or kitchen-free homes in Los Alomos).\n\nThe actual numbers are nothing short of staggering. Though final tallies won\u2019t be available til Monday, it seems that Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie has raked in about $155 million domestically and another $182 million internationally, exceeding even sky-high expectations. Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer has earned about $80.5 million domestic and $93.7 million internationally\u2014a pretty stunning take for a three-hour drama about men in hats discussing theoretical physics.\n\nThat means together, the phenomenon known as Barbenheimer has made about $511 million worldwide, $235.5 million of which was earned domestically\u2014enough to make this the fourth-highest grossing weekend in American history, and the only one of those four weekends not driven by a Disney-released sequel. (The openings of Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame, and Star Wars: The Force Awakens occupy the no. 1, 2, and 3 slots, respectively.)\n\nDeadline has a rundown of all the box office records that have just been broken: Barbie now boasts the biggest opening weekend ever for a female director. It's also the largest opening weekend for a movie based on a toy (beating out Transformers: Dark of the Moon). Oppenheimer has the biggest global opening for a biopic.\n\nBut those stats undersell what really was, and is, special about Barbenheimer. Heavily marketed as both these films have been, their massive success feels like an organic phenomenon, driven by actual enthusiasm from actual people. (What a concept!) Yes, Barbie is based on IP, and so, in a sense, is Oppenheimer. Both films are nevertheless idiosyncratic, auteur-driven projects, and not the sort of high-octane action franchise continuations studios seem to believe are the only sort of movie capable of making big money anymore. Both are also being received better than most wannabe blockbusters: critics (including Vanity Fair\u2019s!) have reacted warmly to each film, while audiences have given each film an A Cinemascore.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the apparent contrast between Barbie and Oppenheimer wound up working in both films' favor; scores of moviegoers elected to see not one movie but both, dressing up in midcentury hats and suits as well as their Barbie best. \u201cPeople recognized that something special was happening and they wanted to be a part of it,\u201d Michael O\u2019Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners, told CNBC. \u201cOur partners in the creative community and at the studios gave audiences two uniquely different, smart and original stories that were meant for the big screen, and movie lovers responded by gathering friends and family and heading to their local movie houses across the nation.\u201d\n\nThe singularity of Barbenheimer will be difficult if not impossible to recreate, though that doesn\u2019t mean studios won\u2019t try. We can only hope, then, that they take the right lesson from this weekend: as Nicole Kidman keeps telling us, people want to go back to movie theaters. They\u2019re simply more willing to return if it means getting to see something they haven\u2019t seen a million times before."

    "text": "\"I don't think anyone could have reasonably predicted this kind of confluence between 'Oppenheimer' and 'Barbie,'\" said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. \"If you're going to a theater right now, the communal experience is reminiscent of major Marvel and Star Wars films, but without those franchises remotely involved.\"\n\n\"Barbie\" tallied around $155 million during its first three days in theaters, the highest opening of 2023. Its counterpart \"Oppenheimer\" made $82.4 million over the weekend, according to numbers released Monday.\n\n\"Barbenheimer\" exploded over the weekend, generating more than $235.5 million in ticket sales and reinvigorating the domestic box office.\n\nMore than 18.5 million tickets were bought for the combination of Warner Bros. ' \"Barbie\" and Universal's \"Oppenheimer,\" 12.8 million for \"Barbie\" and 5.8 million for \"Oppenheimer,\" according to data from EntTelligence.\n\n\"It was a truly historic weekend and continues the positive box office momentum of 2023,\" said Michael O'Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners. \"More importantly, it proves once again that America loves going to the movies to see great films.\"\n\nBoth films hold a rating of more than 90% \"Fresh\" on Rotten Tomatoes and inspired moviegoers to dress head-to-toe in pink or don suits and hats during their screenings.\n\n\"People recognized that something special was happening and they wanted to be a part of it,\" O'Leary said. \"Our partners in the creative community and at the studios gave audiences two uniquely different, smart and original stories that were meant for the big screen and movie lovers responded by gathering friends and family and heading to their local movie houses across the nation.\"\n\nWith additional ticket sales from Paramount's newest \"Mission Impossible\" film, Sony's \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" and Angel Studios' \"The Sound of Freedom,\" the weekend box office is expected to reach $302 million, the highest of any weekend in 2023, according to data from Comscore.\n\n\"The unprecedented performance of these two films, and the boost it gave to the overall movie marketplace, solidified the movie theater as a cultural hub and epicenter of social interaction,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.\n\n\"Barbenheimer\" weekend is currently set to be the fourth-highest weekend haul of all-time, just below the three-day stretch when Disney's \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" arrived in theaters in December 2015 and helped boost the overall weekend haul to $313 million. The second-highest is $314 million from April 2018's opening weekend of \"Avengers: Infinity War.\"\n\nSome box office analysts project that Monday's official weekend numbers could be quite a bit higher than Sunday's estimates, and push \"Barbenheimer\" weekend up the charts. However, they won't come close to the highest-grossing weekend ever, which occurred in April 2019 when \"Avengers: Endgame\" hit theaters, drumming up $357 million on its own, and leading to a $402 million overall weekend tally.\n\nThe success of \"Barbenheimer\" comes at a time when the domestic box office has faced some hurdles. A slew of adult-aimed blockbusters have underperformed, leading many in the industry to question if consumer tastes have shifted away from Hollywood.\n\nWarner Bros.' \"The Flash\" has fizzled, Pixar's \"Elemental\" failed to lure in family audiences and even the return of Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones wasn't enough to pack cinemas.\n\nHowever, the combination of bombs and blonde bombshells seems to have inspired plenty of moviegoers to leave their couches for the cinema.\n\n\"It's a historic result that showcases the enthusiasm audiences have for a variety of fresh content,\" Robbins said. \"These films have exquisitely tapped into the cultural zeitgeist. They've reignited the summer box office flame, and they've proven that studios can be a little more aggressive with counter-programming strategies in the future.\"\n\nDisclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC. NBCUniversal is the distributor of \"Oppenheimer\" and owns Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nFor more, check out CNBC Select's story on how to save money on movie tickets."

    "text": "When Christopher Nolan was doing research for \"Oppenheimer,\" he quietly joined a walking tour of the grounds in Los Alamos, N.M., the epicenter of the Manhattan Project.\n\nThe director was so impressed that he decided to turn this tucked-away town of 13,000 into a Hollywood lot. For two weeks in spring 2022, celebrities including Matt Damon and Emily Blunt shot in local locations, including the former cottage of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the key figure in America's quest to build an atomic bomb and win a war.\n\nThat house probably won't be open to the public until later this year. But Los Alamos is already worth exploring.\n\nIn June, I started with the free Bradbury Science Museum, named after Norris E. Bradbury, who replaced Oppenheimer as head of the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Fortunately, the gregarious security guard didn't evict me for assuming the center would be a tribute to science fiction writer Ray Bradbury.\n\nThe exhibits detailing the lab's work on stuff like algae biofuels and nanotechnology went over my head. But the film \"Racing Toward Dawn,\" which chronicled how Oppenheimer and his colleagues picked this city for its secret experiments, was geared toward dimwits like me.\n\nIt was the perfect prep for the $25 deluxe walking tour that embarked from the Los Alamos History Museum gift shop, just three blocks away.\n\nBefore my group of seven took off, I had time to check out a few displays. My favorite nugget: a copy of the daily \"secret\" newsletter from Dec. 22, 1943, which warned readers to recycle their Coca-Cola bottles and to avoid burning their Christmas trees. It also let folks know that the featured movie that evening would be \"Old Acquaintance\" starring Bette Davis.\n\nThe Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, N.M.\n\nHistory tour\n\nOur tour guide, Kathy, preferred to serve up history in chronological order, which meant our 90-minute walk started with a stop at an 800-year-old ancestral Pueblo site. She soon jumped centuries ahead to the period in which Los Alamos played host to the all-boys Ranch School, whose students included future Sears, Roebuck president Arthur Wood and writer Gore Vidal.\n\nKathy nearly spat on the ground when she pointed to the former site of the school's dorms, now one of the most unattractive strip malls this side of the Mississippi. A military team led by Brig. Gen. Leslie Groves shut down the school in 1942, so it could be adapted for the needs of its incoming residents.\n\nMany of the buildings were torn down, but Fuller Lodge, the school's dining hall, remained. The scientists would also use it for meals, as well as for late-night activities that no teenage boy should ever attend.\n\nArchitect John Gaw Meem used wood from more than 700 Ponderosa pines to construct this marvel that's part barn, part palace. If the super-wealthy ever got into square dancing, this would be party central.\n\nJust outside the lodge stands bronze statues of Oppenheimer and Groves. Kathy pointed out that the replica of the military commander isn't entirely accurate. His family asked that designers not show off his impressive pot belly.\n\nNext up was a walk down Bathtub Row, so named because its residents had the only tubs in town. During the stroll, Kathy entertained our group with tales of Russian spies and how Oppenheimer's security clearance was eventually revoked.\n\nShe also shared how excited she was about the \"Oppenheimer\" movie. She guaranteed that it would be better than 2014's \"Manhattan,\" the locally shot TV series so inaccurate that her husband, who worked for the laboratory at the time, screamed at the TV for 10 minutes.\n\nAll we could do once we arrived at the Oppenheimer house was peek through the windows. I was surprised to see pristine furniture in the living room that looked like it was part of a movie set. That's because it was.\n\nThe History Museum is planning to keep the house furnished with movie props rather than stock it with Oppenheimer's original couches and tables, a decision that should delight film fans and irk history buffs once it's open to the public.\n\nYou can go inside the neighboring house of Hans Bethe, who headed up the Manhattan Project's Theoretical Division. It hosts a history lesson on the Cold War, just one of the many attractions that force you to contemplate whether what these geniuses made here was a blessing or a curse.\n\nThe Los Alamos National Laboratory\u2019s Chemistry and Metallurgy Research facility and the lab\u2019s largest building.\n\nIn and around Los Alamos\n\nThere are many ways to get to Los Alamos. I caught a flight to Albuquerque, arriving just in time to enjoy a late dinner at Frontier Restaurant, a hangout for college students and diners who think food tastes better under portraits of John Wayne.\n\nTake your time making the 90-minute drive north to Los Alamos. I stopped at the Walatowa Visitor Center at Jemez Pueblo the next morning for hot coffee and a history lesson on some of the Native Americans who developed this area.\n\nFor those seeking a more relaxing pit stop, meander around Jemez Springs, a village crammed with inns, spas and art galleries. Drivers skittish about the winding road ahead \u2014 it's a roller-coaster ride that may make your stomach your churn \u2014 may want to book a massage.\n\nOr you can steady your nerves after you arrive in Los Alamos with lunch at Blue Window Bistro. The spacious restaurant serves a tart strawberry lemonade and a New Mexico dip sandwich so tender that the au jus seemed redundant.\n\nBefore making the 90-minute drive on to Taos, the tourist town where folk art is treated like Michelangelo, I paused at Ashley Pond, across the street from the Oppenheimer sites. It's a picturesque park that wouldn't be out of place in a Frank Capra movie. It doesn't play a significant role in history, but it's a pleasant place in Los Alamos to clear your just-blown mind."

    "text": "The movie event of the summer has officially arrived. There's just one problem: It's basically impossible to get good seats.\n\nSince its premiere last weekend, tickets for Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer have been selling fast. But while it's easy for any schmuck to see the epic biopic in digital, Nolan has made it clear that the best way to see his film is in IMAX 70mm \u2014 a format that only 30 locations in the U.S. are capable of playing. The exclusivity has made this the most coveted movie ticket of the summer, with fans willing to pay hundreds of dollars for a chance to see the movie in its intended format.\n\nCillian Murphy in 'Oppenheimer'. Universal Pictures\n\nOn Monday, a Craigslist post selling eight 70mm IMAX tickets for the whopping price of $1,400 went viral on social media. The seats in a Midtown Manhattan theater were in the fourth row, \"perfect center\" and could not be sold separately.\n\nThe post has since been deleted (leaving us to wonder if someone really spent more than a grand on movie tickets), but plenty more tickets are being resold and requested on third-party websites like Craigslist and eBay.\n\nOne eBay sale lists two mid-August tickets with a starting bid of $499. Over on Craigslist, there are a few reasonably-priced tickets \u2014 like a fair $20 for IMAX seats in Grand Rapids, Mich. \u2014 while others bump the price significantly. Some fans are even posting Wanted ads, seeking out those willing to part with their tickets.\n\n\"Will pay over retail up to $150+ for good seats and date,\" wrote one anonymous Bay Area user. Elsewhere, a New Yorker is requesting two seats for any Aug. 6 showing, promising to pay a total of $300.\n\nStarring Cillian Murphy, Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt, and Robert Downey Jr, the movie tells the story of Robert J. Oppenheimer (Murphy), long known as \"the Father of the Atomic Bomb.\" Despite not having the franchise or family appeal of most summer blockbusters, the film cracked $80.5 million in its opening weekend. The phenomenon is partially due to the Barbenheimer craze, which involves pairing the biopic with Barbie for a bizarre double feature.\n\nIn a promo for the film, the cast and crew made a point of highlighting the allure of seeing the film on the biggest screen possible.\n\n\"Oppenheimer's story is one of the biggest stories imaginable,\" Nolan said. \"Our film tries to take you into his experience, and IMAX for me is a portal into a level of emotion that you can't get from other formats.\"\n\nThe filmmaker continued, \"IMAX 70mm is the highest-quality imaging format that's ever been devised. It allows you to fully immerse yourself in the story. When the audience is able to see this in IMAX, on the big screen, they will be able to experience an extraordinary moment in human history.\"\n\nWant more movie news?

    "text": "MUMBAI, July 24 (Reuters) - A scene featuring a holy Hindu scripture in nuclear arms biopic \"Oppenheimer\" has drawn social media fire in India, with many users saying they would boycott the movie because of what one nationalist group called a \"scathing attack on Hinduism\".\n\nThe scene features the protagonist reciting a verse from the Bhagwad Gita, considered the holiest of Hindu scripture, just before sexual intercourse.\n\nThe film, which was released in India on Friday with much fanfare, was rated by the Central Board of Film Certification U/A, which recommends parental guidance for viewers aged under 12.\n\n\"This should be investigated... on an urgent basis and those involved should be severely punished,\" the nationalist \"Save Culture Save India Foundation\" said in a press release.

    "text": "UPDATE: A big weekend at the box office with something for everyone and notable milestones including Barbie crossing the $1B global mark while Oppenheimer topped $550M, as we noted earlier. In new plays, Meg 2: The Trench opened to a strong $142M global and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem started rollout with $8.5M in just 30% of its offshore footprint (global was $51.6M). Meanwhile, Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One is nearing $500M worldwide and Insidious: The Red Door has become the top-grossing horror movie of the year at $182.5M.\n\nAlso in the mix, Disney crossed $4B worldwide, the first studio to do so this year. Of the total $4.005B, $1.595B is from domestic and $2.41B from the international box office, powered by such titles as Avatar: The Way of Water, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, The Little Mermaid, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Elemental and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.\n\nAs we wrote on Sunday, Warner Bros\u2019 Barbie became only the second movie to cross $1B this year while Greta Gerwig has become the first woman to surpass that benchmark as a solo director. For more on Barbie, see here.\n\nUniversal\u2019s Oppenheimer is now at an estimated $553M through Sunday, the fifth biggest Christopher Nolan title of all time. The overseas weekend was $52.8M (-31%) for an offshore cume of $324.4M which is above Dunkirk, Interstellar, Tenet and The Dark Knight Rises at the same point. This is the top Nolan movie ever in 46 markets including the Netherlands, India, Saudi Arabia, Belgium, Norway & the UAE.\n\nIn IMAX, Oppenheimer has now joined the format\u2019s global Top 10 releases of all time at No. 8 and with a running total of $114.2M. It\u2019s also the biggest Nolan movie ever in IMAX. At $49.6M internationally, this is the 4th highest ever IMAX title in like-for-like markets.\n\nOverall, the Top 5 markets to date are the UK ($50.3M), Germany ($28.3M), France ($24.2M), Australia ($18.2M) and India ($16.1M). For more on Oppenheimer\u2019s milestones, see here.\n\nKorea, Italy and China are still due to release this month.\n\nIn new play, Warner Bros/Legendary\u2019 East\u2019s Meg 2: The Trench chomped on $142M globally with $112M from 75 overseas markets. The sequel was No. 1 in 23 offshore hubs, including China, Spain, Indonesia, Taiwan and Mexico as well as in the Middle Eastern region.\n\nIn like-for-like markets and using today\u2019s exchange rates, the film is tracking on par with Godzilla: King of the Monsters, 5% over The Meg, 6% above Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, 11% above Pacific Rim: Uprising and 12% over Rampage.\n\nIn Latin America, the 3D share was a great 21% while the movie opened ahead of M:I7 by 20% and 107% above Indiana Jones 5. In Malaysia and Thailand, it scored the biggest WB opening of 2023.\n\nThe top debut was China at $53.3M and boosted by the presence of action star Wu Jing. The results are 8% over Jurassic World Dominion, 11% better than the original Meg, 41% above Rise of the Beasts and 109% over M:I7.\n\nMexico was next with $7.6M at No. 1 and above comps. The UK also gave the giant shark a No. 1 start with $5.1M and 9% ahead of The Meg and other creature comps. France bowed with $4.5M, roughly on par with The Meg and over other monsters. In Spain, the No. 1 launch of $3.4M topped The Meg by 50% and was more than double the start of Kong: Skull Island.\n\nAlso getting going was Paramount\u2019s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem with the first 24 markets releasing this session for $8.5M. The UK ($5M) and Germany ($1M) were the only majors. Markets yet to open include France, Mexico and China this week, followed by Spain and Brazil in August and Australia, Korea and Japan in September.\n\nIn holdover news, Paramount/Skydance\u2019s Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One added $17.6M in 69 markets, a drop of 45%. The overseas cume is $342.8M for $493.8M global. Top markets are China ($47.6M) Korea ($30.3M), the UK ($29.7M), Japan ($21.3M) and France ($20.4M).\n\nDisney/Pixar\u2019s Elemental added $14.2M, a great hold of -29%, from 51 markets for an international cume of $275.4M and a global take of $423.7M. Italy notably saw a 28% hike versus last frame. Japan was new this session at $2.3M ahead of the Obon holidays and the 2nd best opening weekend of all Disney/Pixar animation films since the start of the pandemic era. Social scores are ahead of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Inside Out and Encanto.\n\nTop 5 markets to date are Korea ($48.1M), Mexico ($20.1M), France ($18.9M), UK ($18.2M) and China ($15.9M).\n\nMISC UPDATED CUMES/NOTABLE\n\nHaunted Mansion (DIS): $4.2M intl weekend (37 markets); $17.6M intl cume/$59.6M global\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (DIS): $4.2M intl weekend (52 markets); $197.8M intl cume/$368.4M global\n\nTransformers: Rise of the Beasts (PAR): $2.9M intl weekend (38 markets); $276.7M int cume/$433.7M global\n\nInsidious: The Red Door (SNY): $2.5M intl weekend (59 markets);$101.8M intl cume/$182.5M global\n\nThe Super Mario Bros Movie (UNI): $997K intl weekend (81 markets); $778.6M intl cume/$1.353B global\n\nPREVIOUS, SATURDAY UPDATE: It is incredible, and incredibly encouraging, to see that here we are with yet another amazing weekend at the global and international box office. To wit: the third week of Warner Bros\u2019 Barbie continues to reign tall as she surfs towards the coveted $1B milestone this weekend. Through Friday, the Greta Gerwig-directed pic is at $951.M worldwide including $527.7M from 69 overseas markets in release.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, as noted previously, Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer has reached the $500M global milestone, on its way to an estimated $551M through Sunday. (See more here)\n\nOn Barbie, the Top 5 to date are the UK ($80.6M), Mexico ($46.6M), Brazil ($37.2M), Australia ($36M) and, somewhat improbably, China ($30.1M).\n\nMeanwhile, WB\u2019s China coproduction Meg 2: The Trench is now in 75 markets and has grossed $46M through Friday after a strong $34M Friday. That includes a terrific $20.5M start in China at No. 1 yesterday, on par with Kong: Skull Island, and ahead of the original Meg (+37%) as well as more recent comps like Transformers: Rise of the Beasts and Mission 7.\n\nCMC releases the movie in China where today it was overtaken by a local total in preview release. The social and critical scores in China on Meg 2 are higher than the original, but it\u2019s getting beat in presales for the next several days.\n\nMORE\u2026\n\nPREVIOUS FRIDAY: As she heads into the third weekend of release, Warner Bros\u2019 Barbie has hit two new milestones, crossing both $500M at the international box office and the nine-century mark worldwide. The Greta Gerwig-directed phenomenon added $16.8M from 69 offshore markets on Thursday, bringing the overseas total to $509.7M through yesterday. Globally, the doll is standing tall with $916.1M as she looks to rollerblade past $1B this weekend.\n\nThe Top 5 markets to date for the Margot Robbie-starrer are the UK ($77.3M), Mexico ($45.8M), Brazil ($36.5M), Australia ($34.3M) and China ($29.5M).\n\nSpeaking of China, Warner Bros\u2019 co-production Meg 2: The Trench has taken its first bites at the international box office, grossing $11.5M through Thursday in 57 markets. The giant shark also swam into China today, opening with an estimated RMB 146.1M ($20.4M). That figure is not included in the numbers through Thursday and while there is not yet a Maoyan audience score in the market, the ticketing platform is predicting an RMB 1B ($140M) finish across the full run.\n\nThe first Meg installment was a surprise summer hit when it opened in August 2018. Jason Statham returns here while massive Chinese action star Wu Jing joins the proceedings. Ben Wheatley directs the story of a research team taking on countless creatures whose deep-water habitat is being invaded. Jon Hoeber & Erich Hoeber and Dean Georgari are screenwriters.\n\nThursday for the pic was worth $8.1M. Latin American markets opened strong with the film ranking No. 1 for the region, topping the opening days of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny by 134%, Pacific Rim: Uprising by 94% and Godzilla: King of the Monsters by 51% as well as coming in roughly on par with The Meg.\n\nThe top plays to date are France with $2M in the first two days, followed by Mexico with $1.4M on Thursday at No. 1 and above Kong: Skull Island (+4%), Godzilla: King of the Monsters (+8%), Transformers: Rise of the Beasts (+29%), Rampage (+30%) and nearly triple the opening day of Indiana Jones 5. Germany at $1.1M was double the first day of the original and is 6% above Indy 5, 42% over Rise of the Beasts and 32% over the first day of Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One. Italy is tracking ahead of most comps including the original, Indy 5 and M:I7. Indonesia is next up with $537K while Netherlands debuted on Thursday with a strong 3D share of 54%. Opening day results are 19% above The Meg, 27% ahead of King of the Monsters, 49% over Mission 7 and 52% ahead of Jurassic World Dominion.\n\nA further 18 markets release today, including Spain, the UK and China.\n\nChristopher Nolan\u2019s epic Oppenheimer is, meanwhile, on its way across the $500M mark globally with $478.8M through Thursday. Yesterday\u2019s offshore gross was $10.6M, lifting the international box office cume to $278.9M.\n\nIn the UK, the through-Thursday total on the Universal film is $43.1M, in line with Dunkirk. Germany is next best with a running cume of $23M, performing 15% above The Dark Knight Rises and surpassing the lifetime of The Dark Knight, having already overtaken the lifetimes of Dunkirk, Interstellar and Tenet. France has a market cume to date of $21M, which is 11% above The Dark Knight Rises and has surpassed the full run of The Dark Knight. Australia is now at $15.3M, 58% above Dunkirk, having surpassed the lifetimes of Interstellar and Tenet. India has a running total of $14.7M, having already surpassed the lifetimes of all Nolan comps. The title is the 2nd biggest Hollywood movie of the year behind Fast X in that market.\n\nOther notable cumes include Mexico at $12.6M; Spain with $12.1M and performing above The Dark Knight Rises (+35%), having passed the lifetimes of Dunkirk, Interstellar and Tenet; Saudi Arabia at $9.3M which is bigger than the lifetime of all Nolan comps; and Netherlands where Oppenheimer has become Nolan\u2019s biggest film ever, with $9.2M so far.\n\nMore to come throughout the weekend."

It\u2019s also the highest grossing movie set during World War II, according to Universal.\n\nIn its third weekend, \u201cOppenheimer\u201d has had incredible stamina as the No. 3 movie in both domestic and international box offices.\n\nNolan\u2019s blockbuster has had \u201can astounding theatrical run made all the more impressive by the R-rating, running time and subject matter which, in the hands of a lesser filmmaker and absent a spectacular marketing and release strategy, would have likely wound up as a mere footnote when referencing the performance of historical dramas at the box office,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.\n\nThe box office numbers are impressive for a three-hour biography about J.

The movie is one of only four biopics to earn more than half a billion dollars globally, alongside \u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\u201d \u201cPassion of the Christ,\u201d and \u201cAmerican Sniper.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Oppenheimer\u2019\u2026 (has) become one of the most revered, talked about and successful summer movies ever to be released by a major studio,\u201d said Dergarabedian, adding the movie \u201cdemonstrates the power of great filmmaking and of course a bit of unforeseeable \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 magic.\u201d\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d and \u201cBarbie\u201d had a symbiotic relationship in the lead-up to their shared debut on July 21, perhaps helped by their very different styles and tones."

    "text": "'Barbie,' 'Oppenheimer' and 'The Last Voyage of the Demeter'\n\nBarbie continues to bedazzle everything in its path.\n\nThe Warner Bros. blockbuster grossed an estimated $33.7 million at the Aug. 11-13 box office in North America, the ninth-biggest fourth weekend of all time, ahead of Spider-Man: No Way Home ($32.6 million) and not far behind The Avengers ($36.7 million), not adjusted for inflation.\n\nBarbie easily stayed No. 1 as it zoomed past the $500 million mark domestically and $657 million overseas for an astounding global total of $1.18 billion, good enough to pass up Aquaman and rank as the No. 2 Warners film of all time behind the final Harry Potter pic.\n\nSony\u2019s Gran Turismo: Based on a True Story was supposed to have opened domestically, but the pic\u2019s release was delayed by two weeks because of the SAG-AFTRA strike. That meant little competition, considering that Amblin and Universal\u2019s genre Dracula pic The Last Voyage of the Demeter got lost at sea with a dismal $6.5 million domestic opening. Gran Turismo did kick off its international rollout, however, grossing $10.7 million from its first 30 markets.\n\nIt was another eventful week for the female-fueled Barbie. Gerwig now ranks as the highest-grossing female director of all time domestically after her movie skated past Frozen II, which was helmed by Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck. Gerwig is also celebrating becoming the highest-grossing female director of a live-action movie at the worldwide box office after Barbie passed up Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck\u2019s superhero pic Captain Marvel, which earned $1.13 billion worldwide in 2019.\n\nThere\u2019s more: Barbie will soon pass up The Dark Knight\u2018s $534 million to become the top-grossing Warners release of all time in North America after finishing Sunday with a domestic haul of $526.3 million, unadjusted.\n\nUniversal\u2019s Oppenheimer, directed by Christopher Nolan, likewise continues to impress in its fourth weekend, earning $18.8 million for a domestic cume north of $264 million. Overseas, it earned another $31.9 million for a huge worldwide total of $649 million, making it Nolan\u2019s fifth-biggest film.\n\nBarbie and Oppenheimer fell a scant 36 and 35 percent, respectively, as they continued to dominate the upper reaches of the chart. Put another way, Barbenheimer is living the dream.\n\nParamount\u2019s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem overtook Meg 2: The Trench to come in No. 3 in its second weekend with an estimated $15.8 million for a domestic total of $72.8 million through Sunday. The film fell only 44 percent. TMNT\u2018s early global total is $94.7 million.\n\nMeg 2 slipped 58 percent to an estimated $12.7 million for a domestic cume of $54.1 million, notably behind the first film at the same point in that movie\u2019s run. The shark sequel is doing far more business overseas, where it bit off another $43.7 million this weekend for a foreign cume of $202.8 million and a rousing $256.9 million globally.\n\nThe big downer of the weekend was The Last Voyage of Demeter from Amblin and Universal, although the film\u2019s budget was reportedly capped at around $45 million. It is the second Dracula-centric film of 2023 to have little bite after Renfield, also released by Universal.\n\nDirected by Andr\u00e9 Ovredal, Last Voyage of Demeter is based on a chapter from Bram Stoker\u2019s classic novel Dracula about the merchant ship Demeter, which was chartered to transport 50 unmarked wooden crates from Carpathia to London, but there is no trace of the crew when it arrives. Corey Hawkins plays a doctor who joins the ship for its passage. Aisling Franciosi also stars.\n\nDemeter wasn\u2019t expected to be a big August grosser, meaning that summer domestic revenue still has a shot of hitting $4 billion, thanks in large measure to the ongoing strength of Barbenheimer.\n\nTMNT, Meg 2 and the Last Voyage of Demeter underscore the perils of having to open a summer movie amid the dual strikes. WGA and SAG-AFTRA rules prohibit writers and actors from promoting any movie, TV or streaming program from a struck company.\n\nElsewhere in the top 10, Disney\u2019s ill-fated Haunted Mansion fell to No. 5 in its third weekend with $5.6 million for a domestic total of $53 million and $76 million globally. (None of the movie\u2019s stars could attend the Disneyland premiere due to the strike.)\n\nA24\u2019s Talk to Me placed No. 6 in its third weekend with $5.1 million for a domestic cume of $31.2 million, a respectable number for a specialty title.\n\nAngel Studios\u2019 Sound of Freedom crossed the $170 million mark domestically in its sixth weekend with $4.8 million for a cume of $172.8 million.\n\nAug. 13, 7:40 a.m.: Updated with revised weekend estimates.\n\nAug. 13, 9 a.m.: Updated with revised weekend estimates."

    "text": "Are Christopher Nolan movies too loud? It\u2019s a question that\u2019s asked every time the director releases a movie, and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is no exception. Nolan\u2019s sound mix is once again a point of contention among viewers, with some complaining that it\u2019s hard to understand the dialogue against Ludwig G\u00f6ransson\u2019s booming score and other sound design choices. In a recent interview with Insider, Nolan explained that one reason it may be hard to hear the dialogue in \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is because he refuses to re-record his actors in post-production.\n\n\u201cI like to use the performance that was given in the moment rather than the actor re-voice it later,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cWhich is an artistic choice that some people disagree with, and that\u2019s their right.\u201d\n\nNolan refuses to record ADR, so whatever vocal takes he gets on the day of filming are what go into the film\u2019s theatrical cut. That can be a risk in a movie like \u201cOppenheimer\u201d considering the IMAX cameras used to shoot the film are incredibly loud on set, although Nolan said they are getting better.\n\n\u201cThere are certain mechanical improvements,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cAnd actually, Imax is building new cameras right now which are going to be even quieter. But the real breakthrough is in software technology that allows you to filter out the camera noise. That has improved massively in the 15 or so years that I\u2019ve been using these cameras. Which opens up for you to do more intimate scenes that you would not have been able to do in the past.\u201d\n\nWhatever dialogue issues some \u201cOppenheimer\u201d viewers are having with the film aren\u2019t stopping moviegoers from flocking to see the atomic bomb epic. \u201cOppenheimer\u201d has soared past the $400 million mark at the worldwide box office in less than two weeks of release, a huge accomplishment for a three-hour biopic that\u2019s rated R. The film is expected to have grossed more than $200 million domestically by the end of its third weekend in release."

    "text": "Christopher Nolan\u2019s hit film \u201cOppenheimer\u201d rides on the slight but sturdy shoulders of Irish actor Cillian Murphy.\n\nAnd that\u2019s Cillian with a hard K \u2013 get to know it.\n\nMurphy\u2019s performance as physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who led development of the atomic bomb that ended World War II, is one that may explode his fame, going from \u201cI know I\u2019ve seen him somewhere\u201d status to Oscar-contending familiar face.\n\nNot that Murphy, 47, is eager for the spotlight to grow hotter.\n\n\u201cHonestly, this may sound predictable, but I don\u2019t think about that sort of stuff,\u201d Murphy told USA TODAY in an interview before the start of the Screen Actors Guild strike. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to do you any good. I just think about the work.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a primer on one of this summer\u2019s acting supernovas:\n\nWho is Cillian Murphy?\n\nMurphy grew up in a suburb of Cork, Ireland, and was active in plays as a teen. He first appeared on the big screen in 2001 in the film adaptation of an Irish play he starred in called \u201cDisco Pigs.\u201d\n\nThat was followed a year later by a haunting performance in Danny Boyle\u2019s zombie thriller \u201c28 Days Later.\u201d Murphy has appeared in about 50 movies and half a dozen television shows.\n\nIn 2004, Murphy married his longtime girlfriend, Yvonne McGuinness; the couple have two teenage sons. Murphy and his family live in Dublin, deliberately far from Hollywood. He is notoriously shy of the red carpet and prefers the relative anonymity of his native Ireland.\n\nWhat is Cillian Murphy\u2019s biggest role to date?\n\nIf there\u2019s a hint of recognition from movie and TV fans when they see Murphy\u2019s face, that\u2019s probably because of his star turn in the Netflix series \u201cPeaky Blinders,\u201d a drama based on the exploits of a British crime gang that operated after World War I. Murphy played Thomas Shelby, leader of the Birmingham flat cap brigade, in the series, which was among Netflix's most popular at the time.\n\nHave Cillian Murphy and Christopher Nolan collaborated before?\n\nMany times. In fact, Murphy has been a go-to pick for Nolan in six movies, but this latest, \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d is the first time Murphy has taken the lead role.\n\nTheir collaborations include Murphy\u2019s performance as the Scarecrow in three Batman movies, \u201cBatman Begins\u201d (2005), \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d (2008) and \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises\u201d (2012).\n\nIn 2010, Murphy played the role of a business tycoon\u2019s heir in \u201cInception,\u201d and in 2017 he played a shell-shocked solider in the World War II historical epic \u201cDunkirk.\u201d\n\nWhy did Christopher Nolan pick Cillian Murphy for the role of Oppenheimer?\n\nNolan says he never writes a movie script with specific actors in mind. But when he was staring at the cover of the book \u201cAmerican Prometheus\u201d by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin, from which \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is adapted, he knew who his leading man would be.\n\n\u201cI saw that photo (of Robert Oppenheimer) on the cover of the book, with that intense blue-eyed stare, and I thought, 'I know who can do this,' \u201d Nolan says. \u201cI called him and said: \u2018This is the one. You\u2019ll take center stage and carry the audience with you.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMurphy at first was terrified, Nolan says. In a good way. \u201cHe was frightened to just the right degree. He knew he had to do a lot of work, and you\u2019re looking for that in an artist. I didn\u2019t want an imitation. I was looking for our interpretation of this man.\u201d\n\nWhat was Cillian Murphy\u2019s reaction to seeing 'Oppenheimer' for the first time?\n\nMurphy says he was \u201cemotionally winded\u201d after screening the completed three-hour film, which was shot in 70mm IMAX.\n\n\u201cI was knocked out really. It\u2019s hard to take it all in,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a movie that I felt grabbed me by the throat and didn\u2019t let go for three hours. I believe it\u2019s Chris\u2019s magnum opus.\u201d\n\nWill Murphy see 'Barbie,' the other part of the 'Barbenheimer' blockbuster movie weekend?\n\n\u201cFor sure, 100%,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cI\u2019m a fan of (\u201cBarbie\u201d director) Greta Gerwig, of (lead actress Margot) Robbie and Ryan (Gosling, who plays Ken).\u201d\n\nMurphy says his teenage sons \u201ckeep showing me these things on social media where people are saying they\u2019re going to go to one movie and then straight into the other, and I think that\u2019s just great for our industry.\u201d\n\nThe 'Barbenheimer\u2019 phenomenon:How a movie meme inspired the 'crazy, weird' double feature\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Cillian Murphy?\n\nMurphy has produced and acts in an upcoming movie called \u201cSmall Things Like These,\u201d based on the award-winning historical novel by Irish writer Claire Keegan.\n\nThe movie follows a small-town Irish coal merchant, Bill Furlong (Murphy), who on a delivery to a convent discovers a haunting secret that forces him to confront his own and his town\u2019s past.\n\nWith that wrapped up, might a relaxing break be next for the exacting actor, whose on-set intensity echoes that of British-born and Ireland-homesteading acting giant, three-time Oscar winner Daniel Day-Lewis?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not great at taking vacations, man,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cBut maybe that\u2019s why I only do a film a year. It takes too much out of me.\u201d"

    "text": "In a dazzling showcase of movie marketing mastery, the much-anticipated summer movie releases of \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d shattered expectations for the film industry, transforming an opening weekend into an unprecedented blockbuster phenomenon.\n\nCombining the charm of a beloved doll with the captivating story of a visionary physicist, the two films broke records worldwide. Their rise to box office record-breaking numbers\u2014\u201cBarbie\u201d pulling in $155 million and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d making $82.4 million in their opening weekends\u2014can be attributed to innovative and multifaceted marketing strategies.\n\nClaudia Townsend, associate professor of marketing in the University of Miami Patti and Allan Herbert Business School, weighed in on the perfect storm that touted massive success in the theater by addressing some queries about the movies and their marketing strategies.\n\nThe release of Barbie and Oppenheimer, or \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d as social media dubs the films, has had tremendous success. Why such a phenomenon?\n\nIt\u2019s pretty interesting; usually, big movies do not try to release on the same day. Universal was coming out with \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and Warner Brothers was coming out with \u201cBarbie.\u201d At first it was a question of which movie studio was going to change the date of release. Neither of them backed down. However, from a marketing point of view, that made sense. This is an example of counter-programming. One of the essential ideas of marketing is that a product, in this case a movie, has a target audience. And other products that may be in the same category but not going after the same target audience are not really competing with you. \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d are a great example of this as they have very different target audiences. And so, that meant that these movies really aren\u2019t competing. Barbie\u2019s audience is mostly female, and mostly younger, with 75 percent being younger than age 29. Oppenheimer\u2019s audience is mostly male, and skews to an older clientele. The movies aren\u2019t competing because they really aren\u2019t going after the same people. Given this, it\u2019s OK for them to release on the same day. But then, because they\u2019re both such big movies with huge marketing budgets behind them, it actually created a moment and created a phenomenon, where the two movies together are bigger than the sum of their parts. So, by creating this Barbenheimer phenomenon, people are now talking about going to see both movies. You\u2019re getting people who might have just seen \u201cBarbie\u201d also going to \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d and people who might have only seen \u201cOppenheimer\u201d also going to \u201cBarbie.\u201d\n\nAnd then there\u2019s this additional effect, which is to say, since COVID-19, the movie theaters have been desperate to get people back inside. There was this first moment around \u201cTop Gun\u201d that was kind of the first big movie after COVID-19, where consumers were going to the movie theaters in large numbers. And again, that was because there was this cultural moment around it. And now Barbenheimer is doing that again. People want to be a part of the conversation. Not only are people watching the movies, but they\u2019re not waiting to see them at home. So, really, it\u2019s kind of this perfect storm.\n\nA nostalgia factor may have driven audiences to see \u201cTop Gun.\u201d What kind of factors are driving the fan craze behavior for these two films?\n\n\u201cBarbie\u201d is the bigger movie for two reasons. First is that the marketing budget behind it was much bigger. \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d while it is a big blockbuster movie and it\u2019s got a lot of marketing behind it, is potentially benefiting more from being associated with \u201cBarbie.\u201d\n\nSecond, like \u201cTop Gun,\u201d the success of \u201cBarbie\u201d will be in part due to nostalgia. \u201cBarbie\u201d is a good example of where much of the film industry is focusing its attention right now. Movies are expensive and studios are investing in movies that have a preexisting built-in audience. That\u2019s why you see the Marvel movies or other movies using characters that already have a built-in fan base. Barbie is a global brand. Everyone knows Barbie. But what\u2019s interesting about \u201cBarbie\u201d is that, while people have strong feelings about Barbie, not everyone loves Barbie.\n\nThere has been generations of people saying, \u201cI don't know if I want my daughter playing with Barbie.\u201d The movie has done a really good job of addressing that. The movie couldn\u2019t be about how great Barbie is. It also couldn\u2019t just be bashing Barbie. It manages to thread the needle. The movie is really kind of upholding Barbie and what she stands for, but also addressing why people may not like her. Particularly for females, everyone knows about her and has some relationship with her. More often than not these days, we see movies being made where the studios can count on an audience going because there\u2019s some history there. It\u2019s very similar to the reason movie studios want to put a big-name star in their film. The star draws an audience. Barbie is a really big celebrity.\n\nWhat kind of tactics did they use, especially on social media, that drove this craziness that movie marketers will probably look to emulate moving forward?\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t be crazy to think that Barbie is a lifestyle brand. Meaning that right now, Barbie is in fashion, Barbie is in makeup, Barbie is in d\u00e9cor, Barbie is in travel. Right now, Barbie owns the color pink.\n\nI think the marketing lesson is probably less about the movie but more about what you can do with a product and a moment. Along with the huge marketing budget behind this movie there was already this built-in base of understanding who Barbie is and what she stands for. There\u2019s so much more to it than the movie when we see brands coming out with pink clothing or Barbie makeup. They\u2019re referencing the movie because of the moment but they\u2019re also referencing the bigger brand and the doll.\n\nIs there anything else you want to add about the roll out of these movies and the significant impact that it has had on the movie industry?\n\nWe should consider Mattel\u2019s role. The \u201cBarbie\u201d movie comes out of the toy company\u2019s new film division. By creating this movie, the Barbie IP is now so much more valuable. What they have done has been enormously effective. Barbie is having a cultural moment and the meaning of Barbie is currently bigger than the actual product. This is marketing gold.\n\nI think from the marketing perspective what\u2019s interesting here is that Mattel has done something really difficult. We talked about brand positioning and what a brand stands for. Repositioning a brand is very difficult. Right now, Mattel is revamping and repositioning Barbie, without losing her original identity. She had this original identity of being pretty and pink but also kind of unattainable and potentially making people feel bad about themselves. I think what happened here was that Mattel really listened to the consumer, who for years had been kind of unhappy with Barbie. And Mattel tried to address the shortcomings of the product with the movie. In doing so, Mattel repositioned the brand. Barbie now has been repositioned to be a kind of feminist icon, and that's difficult to do. Reinventing a brand is incredibly difficult. That\u2019s something that requires not just money, but great strategy. And it seems like they\u2019ve been able to do that."

    "text": "Cillian Murphy is earning some of the best reviews of his career for leading Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer, but no praise might be higher than this rave from co-star Robert Downey Jr.: \u201cI have never witnessed a greater sacrifice by a lead actor in my career,\u201d the \u201cIron Man\u201d star told People magazine about Murphy\u2019s performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer.\n\n\u201cHe knew it was going to be a behemoth ask when Chris called him,\u201d Downey Jr. added. \u201cBut I think he also had the humility that is required to survive playing a role like this. We\u2019d be like, \u2018Hey, we got a three-day weekend. Maybe we\u2019ll go antiquing in Santa Fe. What are you going to do?\u2019 \u2018Oh, I have to learn 30,000 words of Dutch. Have a nice time.\u2019 But that\u2019s the nature of the ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d shot for 57 days, one of Nolan\u2019s quickest film shoots, and Murphy is front and center in nearly every scene. The cast and crew lived together in the same hotel during the film\u2019s production, but Murphy never joined his fellow ensemble for dinner due to the intensity of playing the lead role.\n\n\u201cOf course he didn\u2019t want to come and have dinner with us,\u201d Matt Damon previously told People magazine. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t. His brain was just too full.\u201d\n\nEmily Blunt reasoned that Murphy did not attend cast dinners because \u201cthe sheer volume of what he had to take on and shoulder is so monumental.\u201d\n\nFor Murphy, \u201cOppenheimer\u201d marks the biggest leading role of his film career thus far. That kind of pressure isolated the actor. \u201cYou know that when you have those big roles, that responsibility, you feel it\u2019s kind of overwhelming,\u201d he told People.\n\nMurphy also lost weight for the role, although he has not disclosed how much. The actor stars in the film as theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who was tasked with leading the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico in the effort to create the atomic bomb. Downey Jr. stars as Lewis Strauss, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission who later persecuted Oppenheimer for being a Soviet spy.\n\n\u201cChris had one of the most incredible leads in Cillian,\u201d Florence Pugh added to People. \u201cHe is an actor that I have been watching for quite some time and have been desperate to work with for ages. You\u2019d have to be mad to say no. It was truly one of the best experiences that I\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorking with him was hugely impressive,\u201d she added. \u201cEvery single day he shows up knowing every single possible way, intonation, inflection of how to bring this character to life. That was hugely impressive to me. There\u2019s a reason why he is one of the greats.\u201d\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d is now playing in theaters nationwide from Universal Pictures."

    "text": "Fans of \"Oppenheimer\" may find it difficult to visit the Trinity Site, the location of the world's first nuclear bomb detonation as featured in Christopher Nolan's latest film, released in theaters July 21.\n\nThe Trinity Site, located within White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, is only open to visitors two days each year: Oct. 21, 2023, and April 6, 2024.\n\nIn a statement by the United States Army, which operates the White Sands Missile Range, visitors were warned that \"due to the release of the movie Oppenheimer in July, we are expecting a larger than normal crowd at the 21 October open house.\"\n\nThose hoping to get a rare glimpse of Ground Zero of the Nuclear Age \"may experience wait times of up to two hours,\" the statement reads.\n\n\"If you are not one of the first 5,000 visitors,\" the Army advises, you might not make it through the Missile Range's Stallion Gate before closing at 2 p.m. The Trinity Site closes promptly at 3:30 p.m. on Oct. 21. The Stallion Gate, outside of San Antonio, New Mexico, is around a three-hour drive from El Paso.\n\nOppenheimer age rating\n\nThe Oppenheimer movie is about the creation of the world's first nuclear weapon and deals with themes of war and violence. For this heavy subject matter, along with nudity, some sexual content, and explicit language, the film is rated R.\n\nOppenheimer run time\n\nIf you want to catch a screening of Oppenheimer before you try your luck at the Trinity Site in October, be prepared for a movie run time even longer than the expected wait to get into the Missile Range: Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer movie is three hours long.\n\nWhat is at Trinity Site, New Mexico?\n\nThe Trinity Site was chosen as a test location for the world's most deadly weapon by researchers like J. Robert Oppenheimer at the Los Alamos National Laboratory for its isolated desert environment. The landscape is as stark and empty as it was on July 16, 1945, when the bomb was tested.\n\nNow an obelisk marks the exact location of the detonation, as well as some historical photographs and samples of trinitite \u2014 an extremely rare and \"glasslike substance that was created from the sand and other materials ... during the intense heat of that first atomic test,\" according to the Los Alamos National Laboratory's Bradbury Science Museum.\n\nIs Trinity Site still radioactive?\n\nAfter the bomb's explosion in 1945, the military encircled the Trinity Site with chain-link fencing to keep both White Sands Missile Range personnel and the public away from dangerous radiation. Just eight years later in 1953, however, the radiation levels were deemed safe and the first public open houses of the area began.\n\nToday it is safe to visit the Trinity Site, a public affairs specialist with White Sands Missile Range assured the El Paso Times in a 2018 interview. \"If it wasn't,\" she added, \"we wouldn\u2019t open it to the public.\u201d\n\nMore:Have a blast: Trinity Site allows public to visit where first atomic bomb was tested\n\nWhy is the Trinity Site only open twice a year?\n\nAlthough the Trinity Site is a National Historic Landmark, representing \"an outstanding aspect of American history and culture,\" it is located within the White Sands Missile Range, a highly active and restricted site for the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nPublic access to the Trinity site is only open twice a year to comply with the military's frequent weapons testing at White Sands.\n\nMore:First atom bomb test: 'It was just like the sun had come up and suddenly gone down again'\n\nWhere to see Oppenheimer in El Paso\n\nMany theaters in El Paso are screening Oppenheimer, including Alamo Drafthouse locations in East El Paso and Montecillo and The Grand Theatre 10 in Fort Bliss.\n\nOppenheimer is only available for viewing in IMAX at the Premiere Lux Cine 17 in El Paso."

    "text": "J. Robert Oppenheimer, director of the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, N.M., in a 1944 photograph. (National Archives and Records Administration)\n\nTOKYO \u2013 When \u201cBarbie,\u201d the live-action movie about a plastic doll, opened Friday in Japan, it did so without \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d the rival film with which it shared a bill in the United States.\n\n\u201cOppenheimer,\u201d a biopic about the father of the atomic bomb, has no opening date in Japan, thus far, and Universal Studios has said nothing about the film coming to the only country targeted in anger with atomic weapons.\n\n\u201cBarbie\u201d arrived divorced from its trendy \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d partner, a phenomenon in July in the United States but a cultural faux pas in Japan.\n\nFilm distributors will consider whether the movie will turn a profit before deciding to show it in Japan, said Kazuhiro Maeshima, a professor of global studies at Sophia University in Tokyo by phone Thursday. Later openings in Japan for U.S. films are not unusual, he said.\n\n\u201cThey may decide that it\u2019s better not to show it in Japan because of this reaction\u201d to the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d controversy, Maeshima said.\n\nThe two films were married on social media in a lighthearted, social-media meme called \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d that encouraged U.S. moviegoers to see the contrasting films in one day. Both movies opened July 21 in the U.S.\n\n\u2018Summer to remember\u2019\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d is based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer, who led the U.S. project during World War II that was first to develop an atomic weapon.\n\nAn Internet meme in late July that grafted images of its star, Cillian Murphy, with one of Margot Robbie, star of \u201cBarbie,\u201d unleashed outrage in Japan for its apparent insensitivity.\n\nWarner Bros.\u2019 official \u201cBarbie\u201d account on X, formerly known as Twitter, re-tweeted a fan-art poster showing Murphy\u2019s Oppenheimer carrying Robbie as Barbie superimposed over a mushroom cloud.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a summer to remember,\u201d declared the tweet, since deleted.\n\nWarner Bros. Japan was among the first to react.\n\n\u201cWe consider it extremely regrettable that the official account of the American headquarters for the movie \u2018Barbie\u2019 reacted to the social media postings of \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 fans,\u201d Warner Bros. Japan tweeted on the \u201cBarbie\u201d Japan account.\n\n\u201cWe take this situation very seriously. We are asking the U.S. headquarters to take appropriate action,\u201d the tweet read. \u201cWe apologize to those who were offended by this series of inconsiderate reactions.\u201d\n\nThe Warner Bros. Film Group the next day offered \u201ca sincere apology\u201d for \u201cits recent insensitive social media engagement.\u201d\n\nSachiko Ishikawa, a YouTuber from Tokyo who tries to demystify Japan by talking about its misconceptions, addressed the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d flap in a video, \u201c#Barbenheimer in Japan?!,\u201d posted Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that the memes weren\u2019t a problem, but what made it all snowball was the response,\u201d Ishikawa told Stars and Stripes by phone Thursday. \u201cThe memes would\u2019ve happened regardless, but the backlash was caused by the \u2018Barbie\u2019 official X reply.\u201d\n\nLiving memory\n\nSachiko Ishikawa, a YouTube video blogger from Tokyo, talks about the \"Barbenheimer\" controversy in Japan against a backdrop of the fan poster on Aug. 9, 2023. (Sachiko Ishikawa/YouTube)\n\nIshikawa said she found the Japanese attitude toward \u201cOppenheimer\u201d interesting. The comments on her video focus less on the meme controversy and more on the history of the atomic bomb.\n\nPeople in Japan associate the atomic bomb and the mushroom cloud with an estimated 110,000 who died immediately and thousands more who suffered from the bombings, Maeshima said. Living survivors tell their stories to subsequent generations, so the atomic bombings are a reality for them, he said.\n\nThe Japanese are reminded of the bombings every August with the anniversaries of the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nBy contrast, in the U.S., the bombings are generally considered a good thing that quickly ended the war, and victims\u2019 stories are reported less frequently, Maeshima said.\n\nEven if the movie reaches Japanese theaters, it may fall flat following the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d incident, he said.\n\n\u201cIt depends on whether one can imagine the tragic situation the bombings have brought on people when thinking about the mushroom cloud,\u201d he said."

Get this, Warners also led that month as well with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2 which made $318.5M of its $381M gross during July back then.\n\nThis July was so great, it was +20% over last July\u2019s $1.14 billion and +6% from pre-pandemic 2019 which minted $1.29 billion.\n\n\u201cJuly was incredible for people who love going to the movies in cinemas with friends and family,\u201d said NATO\u2019s President and CEO Michael O\u2019Leary in statement.\n\n\u201cThis month now ranks as one of the top-performing Julys in the history of motion pictures,\u201d he continued, \u201cConsumer enthusiasm and excitement continues to grow as our partners in the creative community and at the studios continue to release a steady stream of compelling and entertaining movies across multiple genres, while theater owners take showmanship to the next level.\n\nAs we also told you, this past weekend\u2019s domestic haul of $217M for all movies was a record for the final session of July.\n\n\u201cThis past weekend is also further evidence that the economic impact of high-quality movies cannot be measured simply by the opening weekend box office,\u201d O\u2019Leary added.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, July highlights the special bond between the American public and movie theatres and the unique cultural moments they create that cannot be replicated elsewhere,\u201d said the new NATO Boss.\n\nShaping out the rest of the top ten pics of July for the period of July 1-31: 3.) Angel Studios\u2019 relentless Sound of Freedom ($151.3M), 4) Disney/Lucasfilm\u2019s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny ($143.9M), 5) Paramount/Skydance\u2019s Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning \u2013 Part One ($140.4M), 6) Sony/Blumhouse\u2019s Insidious: The Red Door ($78.5M), 7) Disney/Pixar\u2019s Elemental ($64.6M), 8) Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse ($47.1), 9) Disney\u2019s Haunted Mansion ($26.4M) and 10) Sony\u2019s No Hard Feelings ($26.1M).\n\nWith the SAG-AFTRA strike already pushing big movies like Kraven the Hunter, Challengers and the next Ghostbusters out of 2023, and exhibition fearing a downturn at the B.O. come October should the actors\u2019 sit-out continue, the guild\u2019s National Executive Director and Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland told Deadline yesterday that despite that harsh impact, \u201cwe have to take a strong line.\u201d\n\nWhile a supporter of exhibition, Crabtree-Ireland acknowledged that the sector is \u201cobviously very challenged\u201d however \u201cwe can\u2019t allow theatrical exhibition to become a way that the studios are sort of fueling their businesses during our strike.\u201d"

    "text": "Cillian Murphy is the star of Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d but is he ready to embrace the pink? Given the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d craze that\u2019s sweeping the nation, Murphy has naturally been asked a lot about Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cBarbie.\u201d Omelete (via Cin\u00e9filos) even asked the \u201cOppenheimer\u201d actor if he\u2019d play a Ken in a potential sequel to Gerwig\u2019s now historic comedy blockbuster.\n\n\u201cSure, yeah. Let\u2019s read the script, let\u2019s have a conversation,\u201d Murphy responded about playing Ken. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see [\u2018Barbie\u2019]. I can\u2019t wait to see the movie. I think it\u2019s great for cinema to get all these great movies happening this summer.\u201d\n\n\u201cBarbie\u201d opened to a massive $162 million during its opening weekend, but \u201cOppenheimer\u201d was no slouch. The film debuted to a huge $82 million, a staggering number considering Nolan\u2019s latest is a talky, three-hour biographical drama that\u2019s also rated R.\n\nNolan told IGN ahead of both films opening in theaters that \u201cit\u2019s terrific\u201d to have two summer tentpoles being released together.\n\n\u201cSummer, in a healthy marketplace, is always crowded, and we\u2019ve been doing this a long time,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cI think for those of us who care about movies, we\u2019ve been really waiting to have a crowded marketplace again, and now it\u2019s here and that\u2019s terrific.\u201d\n\nMurphy agreed with Nolan, telling IGN: \u201cI think it\u2019s great. I mean, I\u2019ll be going to see \u2018Barbie.\u2019 I can\u2019t wait to see it. I think it\u2019s just great for the industry and for audiences that we have two amazing films by amazing filmmakers coming out the same day. Could spend a whole day in the cinema, what\u2019s better than that?\u201d\n\nWhether or not Murphy becomes a Ken remains to be seen. For now, he\u2019s still processing everything that went into becoming J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who created the atomic bomb during World War II. Murphy went through dramatic isolation periods and weight loss during filming, so much so that Robert Downey Jr. said he\u2019s never seen an actor sacrifice more for a role than Murphy in \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d Is Oppenheimer a hero or a villain? The discussion is a nuanced one for Murphy.\n\n\u201cI do think that he believed it would be the weapon to end all wars,\u201d Murphy recently told NME. \u201cHe thought that [having the bomb] would motivate countries to form a sort of nuclear world governance. He was naive.\u201d\n\nMurphy added that Nolan helped him unlock the more nuanced parts of Oppenheimer\u2019s character. \u201cChris used this amazing phrase,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were talking about Oppenheimer\u2019s arc and he said, \u2018You know, he\u2019s dancing between the raindrops morally.\u2019 That unlocked something in my mind when I was preparing.\u201d\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d is now playing in theaters nationwide from Universal Pictures."

    "text": "Alden Ehrenreich plays a Senate aide, a figure who is one of the many government workers standing behind and to the side of the head honchos helping to grease the wheels of power. He has been tasked with guiding Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) through Senate confirmation hearings on his nomination as Secretary of Commerce to President Eisenhower's cabinet. Ehrenreich is essentially a PR guy, a guide for Strauss and the audience through the tangled web of Cold War-era D.C. and the front-stabbing figures who have turned politics into a battlefield. He is, by design, not that important. Dozens of other nameless aides are waiting around the corner to do this job. Ehrenreich just so happens to be there at the right/wrong time.\n\nBeing an audience avatar is often a thankless role in any film, and it\u2019s a trope that Nolan often struggles with. Discussions of process and ideas often weigh down his films and inserting a figure of relatable naivety into this risks disrupting the narrative flow. \"Oppenheimer\" often gets away with not having one during the glut of the story since it\u2019s so heavily focused on conversations about science, ethics, and consequences. The scenes with Strauss and Ehrenreich are a break from this, an insight into a post-Oppenheimer world and how it has impacted the system that helped to create him in the first place. Ehrenreich is not unaware, nor is he expected to play catch-up with Strauss and company. Rather, he\u2019s the constant reminder that scientists did not do what happened at Los Alamos alone. That he is unnamed and a fictional creation of Nolan (a sharp contrast to a film populated by real historical players) hammers home the disposability of such an aide. Ehrenreich\u2019s job is to blend in, to keep a straight face against the peacocking Strauss. It\u2019s a role that could, too, have disappeared into the background, but Ehrenreich knows that the best scene stealers are the ones who react to the carnage.\n\nEhrenreich, a character actor with the face of a 1950s leading man, has always excelled in parts where he tempers his natural charisma with a dash of something sharper. In \"Hail, Caesar!,\" he steals the show from one of the Coen Brothers\u2019 starriest casts as Hobie Doyle, the adorably clueless singing cowboy the studio tries to reinvent as a Noel Coward-esque debonair leading man. He\u2019s the safe port of sincerity in a storm of Hollywood cynicism. As the younger brother of the tempestuous Tetro in Francis Ford Coppola's indie drama, he is appealingly innocent yet imbued with the abrasive arrogance that only a dolt of a teenage boy could truly possess. Even in \"Solo: A Star Wars Story,\" the u nfairly maligned prequel of the new Disney/Lucasfilm era, Ehrenreich\u2019s Han is less concerned with traditional hero expectations. Audiences seemed furious that he didn\u2019t look or act exactly like Harrison Ford. Still, Ehrenreich understood the giddy enthusiasm of the pre-jaded space cowboy and how the character doesn\u2019t work if he\u2019s always cool (which Ford never was in the original trilogy, something fans often overlook.) The best Ehrenreich performances allow him to dig into humanity's absurdities and petty mundanities, offering either the freaky flipside or a welcome dose of warmth. It\u2019s never as interesting to be cool when you can be weird, dark, or earnest."

Robert Oppenheimer, the mastermind behind the atomic bomb, with Cillian Murphy playing the titular American scientist.\n\nWhile most theaters around the world will be showing \"Oppenheimer\" \u2014 and \"Barbie\" \u2014 there has been some speculation about whether \"Oppenheimer\" will be shown in Japan because of its subject matter.\n\nIn August 1945, the United States used Oppenheimer's work to create a nuclear bomb to hit the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing over 200,000 people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill 'Oppenheimer' be in Japanese theaters?\n\nJapan hasn't completely banned \"Oppenheimer\" from its theaters, but neither is there a release date for the movie in the country.\n\nA Universal spokesperson told Variety in June that \"plans have not been finalized in all markets.\"\n\nThis suggests that Japanese audiences won't be able to see Nolan's movie at the same time as the rest of the world, as Toho-Towa \u2014 the biggest Japanese distributor of Hollywood films \u2014 has yet to decide on its release plans, per Variety.\n\nThankfully, Japanese audiences will soon be able to see the other big movie of the summer, \"Barbie,\" which arrives in the country on August 11.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Oppenheimer' is in theaters now\n\n\"Oppenheimer\" opens Friday in theaters across other countries, including the US and UK, where it will face off against \"Barbie\" at the box office.\n\nNolan recently confirmed that his own daughter, Flora, makes a cameo appearance as a girl whose face melts off during a dream sequence.\n\nThe director also told Insider that it was \"essential\" to film sex scenes for the first time in his career.\n\n\"When you look at Oppenheimer's life and you look at his story, that aspect of his life, the aspect of his sexuality, his way with women, the charm that he exuded, it's an essential part of his story,\" Nolan told Insider about the choice of including sex scenes."

    "text": "Cillian Murphy, the leading man in Oppenheimer who portrays the title character\u2014a.k.a. \u201cdeath, destroyer of worlds\u201d\u2014thinks he bought a sound system with his first big check.\n\n\u201cI think I bought like a record player\u2014or a sound system, cause record players weren\u2019t as cool as they are now, were they?\u201d Murphy told the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nMeanwhile, costar Matt Damon paid for his mother\u2019s Ph.D. and bought his brother a car.\n\nChristopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer\u2014a historical drama based on the 2005 biography American Prometheus\u2014has been a record-breaking box office success. The film has brought in over $188 million in domestic ticket sales and $231 million worldwide since its opening on July 21. Oppenheimer leads Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and Matt Damon shared what they spent their first paychecks on in a recent interview with the THR.\n\nDamon, who portrays Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves, the director of the Manhattan Project, recalled that his first big check came in 1990 for a film called Rising Son. He made $25,000.\n\n\u201cI bought my brother a car and put my mom through her Ph.D. program,\u201d Damon said in the interview. \u201cAnd that was a really cool feeling.\u201d\n\nIn the late 1980s, Damon actually shared a bank account with his childhood friend Ben Affleck, when the two were starting their careers. The two met as kids in their hometown of Cambridge, Mass., and later teamed up on numerous projects, including Good Will Hunting, Field of Dreams, and Air.\n\n\u201cIt was unusual, but\u2026we needed the money for auditions, for trips to New York, so that\u2019s what the money was for,\u201d Damon said in March on the Bill Simmons Podcast, hosted by The Ringer sports writer Simmons.\n\nWhen either of them booked a role, they funneled their earnings into the joint account for future audition costs. It was a kind of mentality of when one wins, so does the other, Affleck said in the same podcast interview.\n\nThe actors closed the account when they both began earning steady incomes. Damon\u2019s estimated net worth was $55 million as of 2016, according to Forbes.\n\nBlunt, who portrayed Katherine \u201cKitty\u201d Oppenheimer, the wife of the title character, used her first paycheck to move out of her parents\u2019 home and rent an apartment. Blunt was listed as the sixth-highest-paid actress in 2020, earning $22.5 million, according to Forbes.\n\nWhereas the A-list leads of Oppenheimer could have demanded $10 million to $20 million on the open market, they reportedly elected to earn only $4 million apiece for the \u201cprivilege of working with Nolan,\u201d Variety reported. Still, they will all receive back-end compensation, meaning they will profit from the film\u2019s box-office success.\n\n\u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 and the strike\n\nOppenheimer\u2019s release was simultaneous with that of Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie, and the Barbie-Oppenheimer social media craze (a.k.a. \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d) helped fuel $311 million in combined ticket sales. This made their joint opening weekend the fourth-highest-grossing domestic box office weekend in history, behind Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame, according to the New York Times, citing Box Office Mojo.\n\nSimilar to Damon, Barbie star Margot Robbie used the money from her Hollywood success to pay off her mother\u2019s mortgage, who supported her financially while she was getting her start.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019d take money out of the house mortgage and lend me money, so I always knew, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve got to pay that back,\u2019\u201d Robbie told CBS Sunday Morning. \u201cI have that piece of paper still. I kept it. Everything I owed my mom, I had it written down.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne day, when I made enough money, I just paid that whole mortgage off completely,\u201d she said.\n\nBut in the wake of Barbenheimer\u2019s continued success, the Hollywood writers\u2019 strike entered its third month and actors have been on strike for nearly three weeks. Release dates for movies like Dune 2 and Challengers (a tennis drama starring Zendaya) have been delayed, as well as new seasons of television series like White Lotus, The Last of Us, and Euphoria.\n\nThe Writers Guild union leaders said on Tuesday they were meeting with studio representatives to discuss restarting negotiations.\n\nThe New York Times recently reported that some of Hollywood\u2019s megastars raised over $15 million for the strike fund, led by actors Meryl Streep and George Clooney. Other celebrities including Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Hugh Jackman, Dwayne Johnson, Nicole Kidman, Julia Roberts, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Oprah Winfrey each gave $1 million or more.\n\n\u201cI remember my days as a waiter, cleaner, typist, even my time on the unemployment line,\u201d Streep said in a statement. \u201cIn this strike action, I am lucky to be able to support those who will struggle in a long action to sustain against Goliath.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve stood on the shoulders of the likes of Bette Davis and Jimmy Cagney, and it\u2019s time for our generation to give something back,\u201d Clooney added.\n\n[Paragraph nine has been updated to clarify a quote from Ben Affleck about his attitude toward the mutual success of himself and Matt Damon.]"

    "text": "Ryan Knapp woke up before sunrise one morning in July and left his home in northern New Hampshire at 5:30 a.m. to catch a movie.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just any day at the cinema. In fact, it was a 14-hour round-trip journey that involved crossing two state lines by car, train and bus. That\u2019s because Knapp wanted to see Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer\u201d the way the director intended: in Imax 70mm, a rare format crafted from Nolan\u2019s film negative, with physical reels spanning 11 miles and weighing 600 pounds. It\u2019s a movie nerd\u2019s dream \u2014 but it\u2019s only available on 30 screens worldwide, 19 of them in the U.S.\n\nSo Knapp trekked to Providence, R.I., for a 2 p.m. showing. The verdict? \u201cIt was definitely worth it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOppenheimer,\u201d an R-rated three-hour drama consisting mainly of people talking in rooms, is not the type of movie audiences typically clamor to see on premium screens. Yet Imax accounted for a whopping 20% of the film\u2019s $180.4 million global opening. And the company\u2019s share of the movie\u2019s box office haul has increased each successive weekend, with the 70mm version raking in $17 million to date, an astounding figure for such a limited format.\n\nAudiences have flocked to Imax screens because they offer an experience that cannot be replicated at home, according to box office analyst Jeff Bock, and \u201cwhen a Christopher Nolan film comes out, that is an event in and of itself.\u201d Plus, premium large formats like Imax 70mm are \u201ca cinephile argument that has now carried over into the mainstream.\u201d\n\nAccording to Nolan, Imax 70mm is the ideal cinema experience because \u201cthe sharpness and the clarity and the depth of the image is unparalleled.\u201d But there are serious limitations when it comes to bringing the format to a wider audience. For one, Imax has only 30 Imax film projectors in rotation worldwide, and it takes three days to create each print. Since most theaters have switched over completely to digital projection, the company worked for two years to evaluate, reinstall and fix Imax 70mm projectors, sending tech teams to every site to perfect the audiovisual components. With \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d Imax oversaw the hiring of 50 film projectionists globally and helped develop the first-ever Imax 70mm black-and-white film, bringing some of Kodak\u2019s more experienced personnel out of retirement in the process.\n\nDue to popular demand, Imax has twice extended \u201cOppenheimer\u2019s\u201d 70mm run. But on Sept. 1, exhibitors will have to cede those screens to Denzel Washington\u2019s \u201cThe Equalizer 3.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe really want to support Chris and the movie in every way we can, but we have to balance that with our other commitments,\u201d says Richard Gelfond, CEO of Imax. \u201cWe\u2019ll play it by ear and see where it goes.\u201d\n\nMark Jafar, Imax\u2019s global head of corporate communications, adds, \u201cImax 70mm film lasts, on average, 10 times longer than regular 70mm or 35mm film. Those prints are assets that we\u2019ll be using for the next 20 years.\u201d He\u2019s confident that specialty theaters like BFI in London and AMC Lincoln Square in New York will bring back \u201cOppenheimer\u201d in Imax 70mm for Nolan retrospectives.\n\nBut it might return even sooner. With theaters selling out more than three weeks in advance \u2014 and fans like Knapp road-tripping to their nearest Imax 70mm showing \u2014 it\u2019s likely \u201cOppenheimer\u201d will come back to premium large formats after moviegoers have checked out \u201cThe Equalizer 3.\u201d\n\nAs Imax 70mm continues to permeate the mainstream and draw in younger auteurs like Jordan Peele and Damien Chazelle, Gelfond\u2019s hope is to \u201cfind more projectors and refurbish them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an art form that\u2019s been fading away,\u201d he says. \u201cImax is all in on trying to keep film alive.\u201d\n\nWith $134 million generated from \u201cOppenheimer\u201d alone, the premium film-tech company is largely responsible for bringing multiplexes out of the pandemic slump. \u201cIf Hollywood is going to invest in one thing,\u201d says Bock, \u201cit should have almost everything to do with Imax.\u201d"

    "text": "UPDATE, SATURDAY August 19: Christopher Nolan and Universal\u2019s Oppenheimer is on its way to yet another milestone, poised to cross $700M global through today. After five frames, the epic is expected to reach $718M with tomorrow\u2019s numbers included. That will make it Nolan\u2019s 4th highest-grossing film ever worldwide, overtaking Interstellar. It will also move into the No. 4 spot on the global chart for 2023 so far.\n\nThe international box office cume through tomorrow is projected at $432M after a $31.8M fifth session. Oppenheimer is the biggest Nolan film of all time at the international box office when restated to today\u2019s dollars and excluding un-released markets.\n\nFor the year so far, the Cillian Murphy-starrer is the No. 3 movie overseas, excluding China where it releases on August 30. As previously noted, this is Nolan\u2019s highest-grossing movie in 50 markets, and now his top non-superhero title in 63.\n\nThe Top 5 markets through Friday are the UK ($62.1M), Germany ($38.1M), France ($30.4M), Australia ($22.1M) and Spain ($17.8M). Also notable, Korea is seeing a big opening weekend with $10.4M through today.\n\nWe\u2019ll have a full update on Sunday.\n\nPREVIOUS UPDATE, August 10: With today\u2019s business, Christopher Nolan\u2019s epic Oppenheimer will hit yet another benchmark, crossing $600M at the global box office. The latest milestone comes just 23 days into release.\n\nAdding $7.7M on Wednesday from 78 overseas markets, the Universal title\u2019s international box office cume through yesterday is $350.7M. The worldwide total is $593.5M. Markets still to release include Vietnam (today) and Italy, Korea and China through the rest of August.\n\nAlready having surpassed Dunkirk as Nolan\u2019s fifth-highest grossing film of all time globally this past weekend and becoming the biggest WWII movie ever worldwide (see previous post below), Oppenheimer is now the filmmaker\u2019s top movie ever in 47 markets, including Germany, Netherlands, India, Belgium, Norway, the UAE, Poland and more. It\u2019s also the best for Nolan outside the Batman franchise in 61 markets, including Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, Central America and the Philippines.\n\nThe Cillian Murphy-starrer has been seeing solid midweek play and, through Wednesday, is led by the UK with $53.4M, in line with Dunkirk (+1%) and The Dark Knight Rises (-7%) at the same point, having already surpassed the lifetimes of Inception, Interstellar and Tenet in the market.\n\nGermany has also advanced since Sunday, now at $31.5M through Wednesday when it surpassed the lifetime of The Dark Knight Rises to become the biggest Nolan film ever in the market.\n\nFrance has grossed $26.1M to date, running 20% above The Dark Knight Rises at the same point in time. Australia is at $19.1M through Wednesday, which is 16% above Inception, having already surpassed the lifetimes of Dunkirk, Interstellar and Tenet. And, India is now at $16.7M.\n\nOther notable cumes include Mexico\u2019s $15.4M, the 2nd biggest Nolan film in the market (having passed The Dark Knight this week); Spain\u2019s $15M, Netherlands\u2019 $12.7M; Brazil\u2019s $10.2M, the 2nd biggest Nolan film ever, behind The Dark Knight Rises and performing 12% above that film at the same point; and Sweden with $6.5M, the 2nd biggest Nolan film in the market (behind The Dark Knight Rises).\n\nPREVIOUS, August 5: Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer has reached the $500M global milestone, on its way to an estimated $551M through Sunday. This would make it the filmmaker\u2019s fifth-highest-grossing film of all time, ahead of Dunkirk. The worldwide total through Friday is $499.3M, meaning that it has already topped the five-century mark today.\n\nOverseas, the Universal title is expected to see an impressive 33% drop in the third frame, adding $51M and reaching an estimated international box office cume through Sunday of $323M, which is 129% above Dunkirk, 169% above Interstellar, 212% above Tenet, and 25% above The Dark Knight Rises at the same point in like-for-like markets.\n\nThe Cillian Murphy-starrer is the biggest Nolan film of all-time in 41 markets including the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, India, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. It is Nolan\u2019s top non-Batman pic in 55, including Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Austria, Poland and Malaysia.\n\nThe epic story of the titular complicated and brilliant physicist tasked with leading the Manhattan Project, the secret effort to create the atom bomb, and the moral and political struggles that followed is now one of four biographical films to cross $500M global box office ever, including Bohemian Rhapsody, The Passion of the Christ and American Sniper.\n\nThrough Sunday, Oppenheimer will rank as the highest-grossing WWII movie of all time worldwide in reported historic grosses, ie also ahead of Saving Private Ryan ($482M) and Pearl Harbor ($449M).\n\nThe Top 5 markets through Friday are the UK/Ireland with $45M followed by Germany with $24.6M, France ($21.8M), Australia ($16M) and India ($15M).\n\nStill yet to release such major offshore markets as Korea, Italy and China."

    "text": "Emily Blunt told People magazine that starring in Christopher Nolan\u2018s \u201cOppenheimer\u201d was like \u201csummer camp\u201d because the film\u2019s ensemble cast lived together in New Mexico during production. However, it appears that leading man Cillian Murphy sat out most group activities.\n\n\u201cWe were all in the same hotel in the middle of the New Mexican desert,\u201d Blunt said. \u201cWe only had each other. Me and Matt [Damon] were roommates and we were like, \u2018Let\u2019s go to have dinner.'\u201d\n\nMurphy did not attend because \u201cthe sheer volume of what he had to take on and shoulder is so monumental,\u201d Blunt added.\n\n\u201cOf course he didn\u2019t want to come and have dinner with us,\u201d Damon said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t. His brain was just too full.\u201d\n\nFor Murphy, \u201cOppenheimer\u201d marks the biggest leading role of his film career thus far. That kind of pressure isolated the actor. \u201cYou know that when you have those big roles, that responsibility, you feel it\u2019s kind of overwhelming,\u201d he told People.\n\nNolan and Murphy\u2019s working relationship spans nearly 20 years and counting as the filmmaker has directed the actor in six movies: Three Batman films, \u201cInception,\u201d \u201cDunkirk\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d Notably, the upcoming atomic bomb drama marks Murphy\u2019s first time headlining a Nolan picture in the lead role. Murphy, who stars as theoretical physicist and \u201cfather of the atomic bomb\u201d J. Robert Oppenheimer, told the Associated Press earlier this year that he \u201cwas desperate\u201d to lead a Nolan movie.\n\n\u201cI have always said publicly and privately, to Chris, that if I\u2019m available and you want me to be in a movie, I\u2019m there. I don\u2019t really care about the size of the part,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cBut deep down, secretly, I was desperate to play a lead for him.\u201d\n\nMurphy landed the lead role in \u201cOppenheimer\u201d via a cold-call offer from Nolan.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s so understated and self-deprecating and, in his very English manner, just said, \u2018Listen, I\u2019ve written this script, it\u2019s about Oppenheimer. I\u2019d like you to be my Oppenheimer,\u2019\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIt was a great day\u2026 We have this long-standing understanding and trust and shorthand and respect. It felt like the right time to take on a bigger responsibility. And it just so happened that it was a huge one.\u201d\n\nThe all-star cast includes Blunt as Katherine \u201cKitty\u201d Oppenheimer, Damon as Manhattan Project director Gen. Leslie Groves Jr. and Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss, a founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. Florence Pugh, Benny Safdie, Michael Angarano, Josh Hartnett, Rami Malek, Dane DeHaan, Dylan Arnold, David Krumholtz, Alden Ehrenreich and Matthew Modine also star.\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d opens in theaters July 21 from Universal Pictures."

    "text": "Cillian Murphy may have avoided attending cast dinners while shooting Christopher Nolan's new drama Oppenheimer in New Mexico, but the Irish actor's decision indicated no lack of friendliness on his part. According to costars Emily Blunt and Matt Damon, Murphy simply had too much on his mind portraying physicist and \"father of the atomic bomb\" J. Robert Oppenheimer to socialize with his castmates.\n\n\"The sheer volume of what he had to take on and shoulder is so monumental,\" Blunt said in a new interview with PEOPLE. \"Of course he didn't want to come and have dinner with us.\"\n\nAccording to Damon, Murphy \"couldn't\" join them for meals: \"His brain was just too full.\"\n\nBased on the 2005 book American Prometheus and set for release July 21, Oppenheimer is billed as an \"epic thriller that thrusts audiences into the pulse-pounding paradox of the enigmatic man who must risk destroying the world in order to save it.\"\n\nMatt Damon and Cillian Murphy in 'Oppenheimer'. Melinda Sue Gordon/Universal Pictures\n\nMurphy himself previously spoke to EW about the excitement he felt being offered the lead role by Nolan. The actor has taken supporting roles in five of the director's films: 2005's Batman Begins, 2008's The Dark Knight, 2010's Inception, 2012's The Dark Knight Rises, and 2017's Dunkirk.\n\n\"It was one of the best days of my life, I'll tell you that,\" Murphy said. \"I'll always turn up for Chris, no matter what the part is, but, secretly, it's a dream to play a lead part. The thing was, I had no idea. There was no preamble or anything, I just got the call. So it was incredibly exciting, and daunting, and terrifying, all at the same time.\"\n\nThe actor also spoke about being part of the film's starry cast, which includes Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh, Rami Malek, Josh Hartnett, and Kenneth Branagh.\n\n\"Every day, you had these phenomenal actors, who are heroes of mine, coming in,\" he said. \"Every day, you were having to raise your game to work with these legends. Everybody was so unbelievably well-prepared. Every single actor, no matter what size their role or the significance of their character in history, each one of them had this massive depth of knowledge that they could draw on.\"\n\nWant more movie news?

The edit, which was first shared by @ProudElephantUS and then reposted to DeSantis\u2019 \u201cRapid Response\u201d campaign account @DeSantisWarRoom, then pivots to a clip of outwardly queer rapper Tyler, the Creator yelling \u201cPsych!\u201d before boasting DeSantis\u2019 various legislative attacks against LGBTQ people.\n\nOne frame, sandwiched between an image of a male bodybuilder and a clip of Christian Bale in \u201cAmerican Psycho,\u201d shows the Republican Florida governor wearing sunglasses above the headline: \u201cDeSantis Signs \u2018Most Extreme Slate of Anti-Trans Laws in Modern History.'\u201d Alongside other images of shirtless men and horrifying headlines, there are two clips of Murphy\u2019s \u201cPeaky Blinders\u201d character, Tommy Shelby.\n\n\u201cWe do not support nor endorse the video\u2019s narrative and strongly disapprove of the use of the content in this manner,\u201d Murphy wrote in a joint statement with \u201cPeaky Blinders\u201d creator Steven Knight, Caryn Mandabach Productions, Tiger Aspect Productions and Banijay Rights.\n\nRepresentatives for DeSantis did not immediately respond to Variety\u2018s request for comment.\n\nThis isn\u2019t DeSantis\u2019 first brush with Hollywood. Notably, the Republican presidential candidate has picked a legal battle with Disney by taking away the company\u2019s power to self-govern the 25,000-acre site of its Orlando amusement parks. In an earnings call in May, Disney CEO Bob Iger called DeSantis\u2019 actions a \u201cmatter of retaliation\u201d against the entertainment conglomerate for its stance against the Florida governor\u2019s controversial \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill in 2022."

But this is a blockbuster about our history as human beings. And it\u2019s just amazing how he pulled it off,\u201d said Downey Jr. who owes his huge popularity in France to his turn in \u201cIron Man\u201d and \u201cThe Avengers.\u201d He said \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is a \u201cblockbuster movie that is about something so intimate and so important.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of having the movie world premiere in France, Downey Jr. said it was \u201can appropriate place\u201d because the \u201cFrench really love and have contributed to so much to great cinema.\u201d\n\nRobert Downey Jr arrives on the red carpet for the world premiere of #Oppenheimer in Paris! Stylish as ever. French fans are getting excited. pic.twitter.com/e9ULtpiyjq \u2014 Elsa Keslassy (@ElsaKeslassy) July 11, 2023\n\nThe atmosphere was solemn if not tense at the premiere event, possibly due to the looming actors strike. The unbearable heat didn\u2019t help either. Murphy, who plays the title role as the American theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, kept a low profile on the red carpet. Blunt, who looked stunning in a silk gown, said it was an \u201cextraordinary set, fully immersive, which is what Chris adores to do, so you feel kidnapped by the experience as an actor.\u201d\n\nBlunt, who plays Oppenheimer\u2019s wife, Katherine Oppenheimer, said \u201cno details were spared and it was just transporting for all of us to be a part of it.\u201d The British actor said she and Murphy, who starred together in \u201cA Quiet Place Part II,\u201d \u201chad already bonded and we were pals,\u201d and that the actors developed a \u201csecret language.\u201d Blunt added of Murphy, \u201cI adore working with him. I would do anything with him. He\u2019s the greatest.\u201d\n\nDamon, who spent nearly 40 minutes with fans signing autographs and posing for selfies, said he was in Paris with his three daughters and looked forward to seeing \u201chow the audience responds to this very special movie.\u201d\n\nGuests inside the Rex Theater were treated with champagne cups, but the concession stands were closed for the occasion, meaning no food was available on site.\n\nUniversal is releasing the $100 million-budgeted \u201cOppenheimer\u201d in theaters on July 21."

    "text": "Cillian Murphy has reacted to the news that 28 Years Later finally seems to be happening.\n\nLast week, the film\u2019s director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland discussed plans to make a second follow-up to their hit 2000 horror film 28 Days Later.\n\nGarland recently said that \u201can idea\u201d for a potential new film \u201cmaterialised a few years ago\u201d, adding: \u201cDanny always liked the idea.\u201d\n\nBoyle told Inverse that the pair are currently \u201ctalking about it quite seriously, quite diligently\u201d, stating that if Garland didn\u2019t want to direct the film, he himself would \u201cbe well up for it\u201d.\n\nSoon after these quotes surfaced, The Independent spoke with Cillian Murphy during the promotional trail for his new film, Christopher Nolan\u2019s drama Oppenheimer.\n\nMurphy played the lead role of Jim in 28 Days Later, which follows survivors of an incurable virus that ravages the world.\n\nThe sequel 28 Weeks Later (2007) focused on a different set of characters, led by Robert Carlyle, and while it\u2019s unknown whether Garland and Boyle\u2019s idea would include Murphy, the actor is enthusiastic about the idea of returning.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great to hear. I didn\u2019t know that \u2013 I would be there in a flash,\u201d Murphy said.\n\n\u201cI made two movies with both of those guys, and I would love to work with them again. Of course, I\u2019m there.\u201d\n\n28 Days Later co-starred Brendan Gleeson and Christopher Eccleston. It grossed $84.6m (\u00a364.2m) from a budget of just $8m (\u00a36.1m). Murphy worked with both Boyle and Garland on the 2007 film Sunshine.\n\nCillian Murphy in \u201828 Days Later' (Peter Mountain/Dna/20th Century Fox/Kobal/Shutterstock)\n\nThe film launched Murphy\u2019s career, and just five years later, he collaborated with Nolan for the first time in Batman Begins. Oppenheimer marks his sixth time working with the filmmaker \u2013 but this time, he takes on the lead role, playing Robert J Oppenheimer, the man who created the atomic bomb.\n\nOppenheimer co-stars Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh. It\u2019s released in cinemas on 21 July.\n\nThe Independent\u2019s full interview with Murphy and Nolan will be published on Saturday (22 July)."

    "text": "1976-present\n\nWho Is Cillian Murphy?\n\nCillian Murphy is an Irish actor who began his career as a theater performer and transitioned into movies and television. He is best known for portraying gangster Thomas \u201cTommy\u201d Shelby on the hit BBC and Netflix series Peaky Blinders, as well as parts in the films 28 Days Later, Batman Begins, and Dunkirk. A frequent collaborator with Christopher Nolan, Murphy plays the title role in the director\u2019s 2023 biopic Oppenheimer about how American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer helped develop the first nuclear weapons.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nFULL NAME: Cillian Murphy\n\nBORN: May 25, 1976\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Douglas, Cork, Ireland\n\nSPOUSE: Yvonne McGuinness (2004-present)\n\nCHILDREN: Malachy and Aran\n\nASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Gemini\n\n\n\nEarly Life and Education\n\nCillian Murphy was born on May 25, 1976, in Douglas near Cork, Ireland. The oldest of four siblings\u2014including brother Paidi and sisters Sile and Orla\u2014Murphy was raised Catholic in a family of academics. His father, Brendan Murphy, was a school inspector, then a civil servant at the Irish Department of Education. His mother, whose name has not been shared publicly, was a French teacher, and his aunts, uncles, and grandfather were all teachers as well.\n\nMurphy attended Presentation Brothers College, a private Catholic secondary school in Cork, where he succeeded academically and discovered he was drawn to the arts. \u201cI was always fascinated by the idea of artists: authors, playwrights, musicians. Those things seemed alien and otherworldly at the time,\u201d Murphy said to The Guardian. \u201cAt a rugby[-playing], academic school, you felt a little bit foolish thinking you could ever enter into that artistic world.\u201d\n\nMurphy, who plays guitar and originally aspired to be a musician, started a jazz-rock band with his friends called Sons of Mr. Green Genes. They were eventually offered a record contract but declined, and Murphy decided to pursue acting.\n\nInspired by a performance of A Clockwork Orange he attended at a nightclub, Murphy became serious about drama while studying law at University College Cork in 1996. A law career wasn\u2019t in the cards\u2014Murphy failed his law exams\u2014but the transition to the stage would prove to be pivotal for Murphy\u2019s future.\n\nTheater Career and Early Film Roles\n\nIn the summer of 1996, 20-year-old Murphy auditioned for and earned one of the lead roles in Disco Pigs, a work by then-unknown playwright Enda Walsh. The play was booked at the Triskel Arts Centre in Cork for a few weeks but became a big hit and sparked an 18-month world tour through Europe, Australia, and North America.\n\nWhen Murphy received the script, it was the first time he had read a play outside of school productions. \u201cThat\u2019s how theater illiterate I was,\u201d Murphy told The Irish Times. Still, he excelled in his role as Pig, and the play was adapted into a 2001 film also starring Murphy.\n\nMurphy began to receive minor film roles following the success of Disco Pigs, including in 1998\u2019s Sweety Barrett, which starred his friend Brendan Gleeson, and 1999\u2019s The Trench, which featured rising talent Daniel Craig.\n\nAlthough his film career took off over the following years, Murphy has continued to act on stage with his most recent role in 2019. He appeared in plays such as The Shape of Things, The Seagull, Love Song, and again collaborated with Walsh for Misterman, Ballyturk, and Grief Is the Thing With Feathers.\n\nMovie Breakout With '28 Days Later'\n\nCillian Murphy\u2019s character Jim walks through an empty London during a scene in the 2002 horror film 28 Days Later. Getty Images\n\nMurphy began to receive widespread recognition with his starring role in the 2002 horror film 28 Days Later, directed by Danny Boyle. In the movie, Murphy plays a bike courier named Jim who awakens from a coma four weeks after a viral outbreak has decimated Great Britain. The film is considered a horror benchmark for utilizing the concept of \u201cfast zombies,\u201d which can run after prey with increased strength, and sparked a renewed interest in zombie media altogether.\n\nIn a 2022 interview, Murphy detailed his audition process and said he initially struggled with the character\u2019s London accent. But with the support of Boyle\u2014who discovered Murphy when watching the film adaptation of Disco Pigs\u2014he eventually \u201ckind of unlocked something\u201d with his performance.\n\nMurphy said the film was \u201cmassive\u201d for his career, opening doors to other projects and leading to his relationship with Christopher Nolan. The following year in 2003, he had a lead role in Intermission and supporting parts in Girl with a Pearl Earring\u2014which starred a 19-year-old Scarlett Johansson\u2014and the war epic Cold Mountain.\n\nCritics also praised Murphy for his performance as antagonist Jackson Rippner in the 2005 thriller Red Eye, with The New York Times\u2019 Manohla Dargis writing the actor made \u201cenough of a picture-perfect villain here that his agent should be worried about typecasting.\u201d\n\n\n\nChristopher Nolan Movies: Batman Trilogy, 'Oppenheimer,' and More\n\nDirector Christopher Nolan worked with Cillian Murphy on five other films before casting him as the lead in Oppenheimer. Getty Images\n\nWith the 2023 release of Oppenheimer, Murphy has now appeared in six of Christopher Nolan\u2019s films. The first was Batman Begins\u2014the beginning of the acclaimed Dark Knight trilogy\u2014in 2005.\n\nMurphy had been a fan of Nolan\u2019s earlier films, including Following and Memento, and told GQ he was one of about 10 actors that auditioned for the role of Bruce Wayne and his iconic alter ego. Nolan said in a later interview that although it was apparent Murphy wasn\u2019t a good fit as the caped crusader, \u201cI felt like, this is somebody I want to work with, somebody who has an interesting take on things creatively.\u201d So, the director let a batsuit-clad Murphy do a screen test for the character anyway and made sure executives from Warner Bros. were there to watch. Nolan saw potential in the relatively unknown Murphy and instead offered him the part of Dr. Jonathan Crane and his nefarious alter ego Scarecrow. Murphy also appeared as the character in the trilogy\u2019s next two films: The Dark Knight in 2008 and The Dark Knight Rises in 2012.\n\nElsewhere, Murphy played Robert Fischer in Nolan\u2019s 2010 sci-fi film Inception and a World War II soldier in his 2017 thriller Dunkirk.\n\nAs for casting Murphy in the lead role of Oppenheimer, Nolan called it \u201chonestly one of my favorite moments in the movie business.\u201d Murphy underwent five months of preparation before the shoot, losing weight to better fit the scientist\u2019s silhouette and practicing his facial expressions. For Murphy, it was a dream part. \u201cI\u2019d always show up for Chris, even if it was walking in the background of his next movie with a surfboard,\u201d Murphy told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cThough\u2026 not sure what kind of Chris Nolan movie that would be. But I always hoped I could play a lead in a Chris Nolan movie. What actor wouldn\u2019t want to do that?\u201d\n\nMurphy\u2019s Other Movies\n\nIn addition to Nolan\u2019s big-budget blockbusters, Murphy has frequently appeared in lesser-known films showcasing his versatility as an actor. He received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in the 2005 film Breakfast on Pluto, in which he played a transgender woman searching for her mother in 1970s London after being abandoned at birth. A year later, he played a soldier in the Irish Republican Army in the 2006 war film The Wind That Shakes the Barley. The film received the Palme d\u2019Or, the highest award at the annual Cannes Film Festival.\n\nIn 2007, Murphy teamed again with director Danny Boyle for the sci-fi movie Sunshine, in which astronauts are sent on a mission to reignite the sun in the year 2057. Other movies featuring Murphy include Peacock (2010), Aloft (2014), Transcendence (2014), The Party (2017), and Anna (2019).\n\nPrior to Oppenheimer, Murphy\u2019s highest-profile film in recent years had been A Quiet Place Part II, the 2020 sequel to the horror hit starring Emily Blunt and John Krasinski.\n\nLead Role in 'Peaky Blinders'\n\nCillian Murphy played Tommy Shelby in Peaky Blinders for six seasons. Robert Viglasky // Netflix\n\nMurphy, who is only just over 5 feet, 7 inches tall, garnered widespread acclaim for his performance as the sometimes larger-than-life gang leader Tommy Shelby in the BBC and Netflix series Peaky Blinders. The drama, which tells the story of a fictionalized crime gang in Birmingham, England, following World War I, ran for six seasons from 2013 through 2022 and featured an ensemble cast including Tom Hardy, Adrien Brody, and Anya Taylor-Joy.\n\nShow creator Steven Knight described Murphy as the antithesis of the often violent and morally questionable Shelby. He initially eyed action star Jason Statham for the role but was reassured of Murphy\u2019s fit for the part by a text message Murphy sent him after auditioning: \u201cRemember, I\u2019m an actor.\u201d\n\nMurphy has described Shelby as a \u201cgift of a character\u201d but exhausting to play. He told The Guardian in 2016 the show required 16-hour days, with the actors working through pages of dialogue. While filming in Liverpool, England, Murphy lived what he called a \u201ccanceled life. You go home to your tiny apartment at the end of the day, and you feed yourself for sustenance, and you learn your lines for the next day, and you try to get as much sleep as you possibly can.\u201d\n\nHis dedication paid off. Murphy won for best drama performance at the National Television Awards and was nominated for a BAFTA TV Award for leading actor following the show\u2019s final season.\n\nWife and Children\n\nAs his theater career was taking off in the summer of 1996, Murphy met Yvonne McGuinness, a classically trained visual artist from Kilkenny, Ireland. Murphy had been recently cast in the stage production of Disco Pigs, and their relationship blossomed as McGuinness accompanied him for much of the show\u2019s tour. The couple has been married since 2004 and has two sons: Malachy, born in 2005, and Aran, born in 2007.\n\nMurphy isn\u2019t on social media and rarely talks about his family in interviews, as he and McGuinness prefer to live out of the spotlight. The actor credited McGuinness for keeping him grounded as his fame grew in the early and mid-2000s, telling People: \u201cIt\u2019s very important to have somebody like that. My life hasn\u2019t changed in any way, really. I still have the same friends, and we go to the same places.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, the family moved from London to Dublin so Malachy and Aran could be closer to their grandparents. McGuinness stayed with their sons in Dublin when Murphy left to film Peaky Blinders in Liverpool.\n\nQuotes\n\nThe fame thing was never a goal. I just want to improve. If I can leave one film behind that\u2019s something that affects everybody, that\u2019s absolutely fine.\n\nI think there\u2019s such a thing as a performance gene. If it\u2019s in your DNA, it needs to come out. For me, it originally came out through music, then segued into acting and came out through there. I always needed to get up and perform.\n\nI\u2019ve never equated success with employment. To me, success is the quality of the work, and I\u2019m patient enough to wait for the next reasonably good script to arrive, because they\u2019re so rare.\n\nIt\u2019s only an advantage as an actor looking younger than you are. If you can maintain it.\n\nFor me, always trusting your instincts is really, really important. Making decisions based on the work and never your career or never making decisions based on strategy. And always following the artists and not the industry.\n\nI\u2019m s\u00ad\u2014 at being anything else other than an actor. I\u2019m s\u2014 at being a personality. I\u2019m s\u2014 at red carpets. I\u2019m s\u2014 at being on talk shows. I\u2019m s\u2014 at, like, all the other stuff that comes with it.\n\nFact Check: We strive for accuracy and fairness.

    "text": "SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher (C) attends a press conference announcing the beginning of a strike, at the guild headquarters in Los Angeles, California, US. Photograph: EPA\n\nThe union representing Hollywood actors formally announced a strike on Thursday, expanding the standoff between Hollywood workers and studio executives over wages, AI technology and how to divide the profits of the new digital streaming era.\n\nThe strike by the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (Sag-Aftra) marks the first time in 63 years Hollywood writers and actors are striking simultaneously.\n\nHollywood writers went on strike in early May. Now the 11,500 members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) will be joined by some of Sag-Aftra\u2019s 160,000 members.\n\n\u201cAt some point you have to say no: we are not going to take this any more,\u201d Fran Drescher, the Sag-Aftra president, said in a press conference. \u201cYou cannot change the business model as much as it has changed and not change the contract too.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t stand tall right now, we are all in trouble,\u201d she said.\n\nA strike is expected to have an immediate impact on publicity efforts for the summer\u2019s top films; the Thursday evening premiere of Oppenheimer in London was moved to start an hour earlier so the cast could attend regardless of the outcome. Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt and Matt Damon were among the stars who staged a walk-out from the premiere to \u201cwrite their picket signs\u201d ahead of the Sag-Aftra strike announcement on Thursday evening. Other major commercial films including Barbie and Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One have already hosted their world premieres, though their stars will be restricted from participating in further promotional events.\n\n[ Hollywood screenwriters strike: how will it affect what I can watch in Ireland? ]\n\nThe simultaneous strikes are expected to halt the majority of Hollywood\u2019s film and TV production, and have major effects on the broader Los Angeles economy. With some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars on strike, press junkets for summer and fall movie premieres will be cancelled, and the Emmy Awards will likely be postponed. Workers across LA are gearing up to survive for weeks or months without wages.\n\nHollywood actors will go on strike after talks with studios broke down, joining film and television writers who have been on picket lines since May.\n\nMembers of both Sag-Aftra and WGA voted overwhelmingly to authorise a strike if needed, a sign of their growing frustrations with what actors and writers have described as shrinking compensation for their work as film and TV shows have increasingly moved to online streaming platforms, and rising fears of how the industry might try to replace creative workers of all kinds with AI technologies.\n\nIn recent weeks, Hollywood\u2019s top acting talent had made it clear they were willing to strike. In late June, a letter from Hollywood A-listers, including Meryl Streep and Jennifer Lawrence, urged their union leaders not to settle for a mediocre deal in what they saw as a historically important contract negotiation.\n\nSag-Aftra and the studios had been negotiating for weeks, but failed to reach an agreement by the deadline of midnight on Wednesday. In a statement on Thursday, the actors\u2019 union said its negotiating committee had voted unanimously to recommend a strike, and that its national board would decide on the matter on Thursday morning.\n\nStriking Writers Guild of America workers picket outside Paramount Studios in Los Angeles, California. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty\n\nIt said: \u201cAfter more than four weeks of bargaining, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) \u2013 the entity that represents major studios and streamers, including Amazon, Apple, Disney, NBCUniversal, Netflix, Paramount, Sony and Warner Bros Discovery \u2013 remains unwilling to offer a fair deal on the key issues that are essential to Sag-Aftra members.\u201d\n\nThe Sag-Aftra president, Fran Drescher, said: \u201cThe companies have refused to meaningfully engage on some topics and on others completely stonewalled us. Until they do negotiate in good faith, we cannot begin to reach a deal. We have no choice but to move forward in unity, and on behalf of our membership, with a strike recommendation to our national board. The board will discuss the issue this morning and will make its decision.\u201d\n\nThe strike might also delay the Emmy awards until late autumn, or even next year, industry publications reported. Disney has announced that a July 15th premiere of its movie Haunted Mansion will still take place at Disneyland regardless of the strikes, though the film\u2019s actors \u2013 including LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish and Jamie Lee Curtis \u2013 will not be present. San Diego Comic-Con, scheduled to begin on July 20th, will be affected as well.\n\n[ Hollywood writers\u2019 strike is at once heartening and depressing ]\n\nHollywood writers have been on strike since May 2nd. The beginning of that strike was marked by strong solidarity from Hollywood\u2019s other unionised workforces, including the powerful Teamsters\u2019 union, and Sag-Aftra members showed up in solidarity at Writers Guild of America picket lines, even before their own strike was called.\n\nAnonymous industry sources told Deadline this week that studio executives did not plan to resume negotiations with the striking writers until late October.\n\n\u201cThe endgame is to allow things to drag on until union members start losing their apartments and losing their houses,\u201d an industry source was quoted as saying, with another saying the goal was to \u201cbreak the WGA\u201d. A spokesperson for the studios denied those anonymous claims, telling Deadline in a statement that the companies \u201care committed to reaching a deal\u201d. \u2013 Guardian/PA"

A new report previewed some of the scenes that Cillian Murphy and Florence Pugh will have in the film, which is coming soon to theaters worldwide.\n\nA new report from The Guardian revealed details about the intimate scenes that Cillian Murphy and Florence Pugh filmed for Oppenheimer. As they reveal, the actors have \"extended scenes of full nudity\" in Christopher Nolan's new film.\n\nIn the film, Murphy plays J. Robert Oppenheimer, a physicist named the man responsible for the development of the Atomic Bomb, while Pugh is his fianc\u00e9e, psychiatrist Jean Tatlock. Apparently, the passionate romance they had is a crucial part of this new film.\n\nWhat rating did 'Oppenheimer' receive and why?\n\nThe rating that 'Oppenheimer' received in the U.S. is R, meaning that anyone 17 years old accompanied by a guardian or an adult, can see the film.\n\n\"An R-rated film, in the judgment of the Classification Board, contains some adult material. An R-rated film may include adult themes, adult activity, aggressive language, intense or persistent violence, sexually oriented nudity, drug abuse or other elements, so parents are advised to take this criterion very seriously. Children under the age of 17 are not permitted to attend R-rated films alone without a parent or adult guardian. Parents are urged to learn more about R-rated movies to determine their suitability for their children. It is generally not appropriate for parents to take their children with them to R-rated movies,\" states this film warning."

In an interview with The Guardian, he said: \"I'm really lucky. I feel embarrassed by it sometimes. I'm just a [expletive] actor.\n\n\"There are doctors and nurses and [expletive] people that work. I struggle with that. I mean, actors are overpaid, you know?\n\nMORE: Cillian Murphy's throwback photo with his dashing dad is too good to miss\n\n\u00a9 Instagram Cillian with his Oppenheimer co-stars\n\n\"It's nice when you get paid, when you're young, and you've gone from having no money, but the Catholic guilt kicks in immediately, and I'm like, 'It\u2019s all going to go wrong. You don\u2019t deserve this'. And I don\u2019t.\"\n\nCillian lives in Ireland with his wife, Yvonne McGuinness, and their two teenage sons, Aran, and Malachy. Despite his immense fame, he prefers to stay out of the spotlight and wouldn't appear on talk shows to promote his movies if he didn't have to.\n\n\u00a9 Getty Images Cillian and his wife Yvonne are rarely photographed\n\nWhen quizzed by The Guardian in a recent interview about making appearances outside of his TV and film roles he said: \"I do them because you\u2019re contractually obliged to. I just endure them. I've always found it difficult. I\u2019ve said this so many, many times.\n\nMORE: Cillian Murphy's rarely-seen sons looks just like him in throwback photo\n\n\"I want to just caveat this by saying, I'm so privileged. I'm so happy to be doing what I love. I\u2019m really lucky. But I don\u2019t enjoy the personality side of being an actor.\"\n\n\u00a9 Robert Viglasky Cillian starred on Peaky Blinders for nine years\n\nHe continued: \"I don't understand why I should be entertaining and scintillating on a talk show. I don\u2019t know why all of a sudden that's expected of me. Why?\"\n\nWhen he's not working, Cillian loves nothing more than being with his family in his home country. He has been married to Yvonne since 2004 after they met at one of his rock band's shows in 1996.\n\nCillian lives in Ireland with his family after relocating back there from London\n\nCillian says he doesn't go out much because he hates the attention. Although he adds: \"I'm always happy to chat,\" to fans, he just doesn't like the surreptitious photo opportunities. Instead, he prefers to stay at home and cook with his wife and spend quality time with his boys."

Pic: The Blindboy Podcast\n\nBlindboy revealed that the Cork actor was set to appear on this week\u2019s episode of the podcast, saying \u2018I was going to have Cillian Murphy on the podcast to speak about his new film Oppenheimer. We were all excited to do it, couldn\u2019t wait\u2026 it was going to be a big exclusive proper chat with Cillian Murphy, who I\u2019ve had on this podcast before.\n\n\u2018But the Screen Actors Guild have gone on strike for the first time in 50 years I believe, that means Cillian Murphy is on strike as well. Cillian Murphy doesn\u2019t cross picket lines obviously, and I don\u2019t cross picket lines, so unfortunately he is not my guest in this week\u2019s podcast.\u2019\n\nWhile Blindboy\u2019s podcast episodes usually begin with a poem read by an \u2018actor\u2019 such as Colin Farrell or Timothee Chalamet, but Blindboy assured that Cillian was definitely going to be on the podcast.\n\nCillian was set to appear on Blindboy\u2019s podcast this week \u2014 but as a result of the SAG strike cannot cross the picket line. Pic: David Fisher/Shutterstock\n\n\u2018I know each week I often start off the podcast with a poem from a Hollywood actor, so it sounds a little boy who cried wolf, but no Cillian Murphy was literally going to be on the podcast this week, and we were going to chat about Oppenheimer.\u2019\n\nThe strike began when Cillian and the cast of Oppenheimer \u2014 which depicts the life of J Robert Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project, which saw the development of the atomic bomb \u2014 were at the premiere of the film in London, leaving before the film began to join the picket.\n\nSpeaking on the red carpet, Cillian\u2019s co-star Kenneth Branagh told the PA news agency \u2018Everybody is working very hard to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen, if it happens I stand in solidarity with our Sag members.\n\nThe SAG strike began when the Oppenheimer London premiere was taking place, with the film\u2019s stars walking out of the premiere before the film began screening. Pic: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images\n\n\u2018We know it is a critical time at this point in the industry and the issues need to be addressed, difficult conversations, I know everybody is trying to get a fair deal, that is what\u2019s required so we\u2019ll support that.\u2019\n\nMurphy told PA \u2018I stand by my colleagues, that\u2019s all I can say to you.\u2019\n\nSpeaking on stage at the premiere ahead of the strike announcement, director Christopher Nolan said \u2018I have to acknowledge the work of our incredible cast, led by Cillian Murphy. The list is enormous \u2014 Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh, Rami Malek and so many more. You\u2019ve seen them here earlier on the red carpet.\n\n\u2018Unfortunately, they are off to write their picket signs for what we believe to be an imminent strike by SAG, joining one of my guilds, the Writers Guild, in the struggle for fair wages for working members of their union.\u2019"

    "text": "Cillian Murphy has become death, destroyer of worlds. Or, at least, he has become J. Robert Oppenheimer, creator of the atomic bomb and the man behind that famous quote. Oppenheimer, the latest film from director Christopher Nolan, opens in theaters on July 21, and it gives Murphy his biggest role yet. The 47-year-old Irish actor has been a regular in the movies and, to a lesser extent, on TV screens for more than two decades before Oppenheimer, the historical war drama about the invention and building of the atomic bombs that were used to end World War II \u2014 and give humanity the power to destroy itself.\n\nRELATED: Oppenheimer Star Cillian Murphy Says Playing Father of Atomic Bomb Both 'Terrifying and Exciting'\n\nBefore Oppenheimer premieres, let\u2019s look back at some of Murphy\u2019s previous roles, including a member of Batman\u2019s rogues' gallery, a scientist on a mission to the sun, and a survivor of multiple apocalypses.\n\n28 Days Later (2002)\n\nMurphy\u2019s breakout role came in 2002 when he starred in 28 Days Later, Danny Boyle\u2019s terrifying reinvention of the zombie genre. The story, which was written by future Ex Machina director Alex Garland, has Murphy\u2019s character, Jim, wake up from a coma after 28 days \u2014 only to discover that a highly infectious virus known as Rage has transformed most of Great Britain into mindless, hyper-aggressive, zombie-like beings.\n\nIt\u2019s an incredible early showcase for Murphy, who has an innate haunting beauty about him that lends itself well to walking around an eerily empty London before chaos breaks out.\n\nThe Dark Knight Trilogy (2002-2012)\n\nMurphy actually auditioned to play Batman in Batman Begins, and while Nolan decided he wasn\u2019t right to play the Caped Crusader (Christian Bale got the role), he felt an instant connection with Murphy, and cast him as Dr. Jonathan Crane, aka The Scarecrow. He\u2019s Batman Begins' secondary villain after Ra's al Ghul, but his fear-obsessed baddie might be the better foe.\n\n(Who can forget how Murphy says \u201cthe bat-man?\u201d)\n\nMurphy would return as the Scarecrow in the next two Batman movies in cameo roles, both of which are delightful.\n\nRed Eye (2005)\n\nThe same year he played a supervillain, Murphy was also playing a baddie in Red Eye, a psychological thriller from Scream creator Wes Craven. Murphy plays the subtly-named assassin Jackson Rippner, who becomes a terrifying threat to a young woman (played by Rachel McAdams) when they\u2019re seated next to each other on a red-eye flight. It\u2019s a great showcase of Murphy\u2019s talents, as he\u2019s got an undeniable magnetism and charisma even as he\u2019s scaring his fellow actors and the audience alike.\n\nThe Wind the Shakes the Barley (2006)\n\nWorld War II is not Murphy\u2019s first on-screen war. He starred in this 2006 war drama about the Irish War of Independence and the subsequent Irish Civil War in the early 1920s. The film won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, and Murphy\u2019s nuanced performance is no small part of that.\n\nSunshine (2006)\n\nThanks to Sunshine, the atomic bomb is not the biggest bomb Murphy has ever created on the big screen. In this haunting sci-fi flick (another Boyle and Garland collaboration), Murphy plays a scientist on the fatefully named Icarus II, a spaceship that will travel to the sun and detonate an unfathomably massive bomb Murphy\u2019s character designed in order to restart it. It\u2019s cerebral, beautiful \u2014 and horrifying.\n\nInception (2010)\n\nAnother Nolan collaboration, Inception casts Murphy as the heir to a business empire and the target of Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s reverse-heist dream invasion. Murphy gives the character the right amount of pathos, and even as you\u2019re hoping DiCaprio\u2019s plan works and they successfully incept him, you\u2019re also yearning for Murphy\u2019s own catharsis, which the film ultimately provides.\n\nDunkirk (2017)\n\nOnce more, Murphy co-starred in a Nolan movie, and once more he played a man who is haunted by horrors unknown to most. (Murphy knows his strengths as an actor!) Murphy plays a consequential but unnamed soldier who is attempting, like so many others, to retreat across the English Channel and escape to fight Nazis another day.\n\nRELATED: Christopher Nolan Teases \u201cInteresting Relationship\u201d Between Endings of Inception and Oppenheimer\n\nDue to the film\u2019s multiple timelines, we see two versions of Murphy\u2019s character. At the start, he\u2019s brash, and a bit of a jerk. But, when he ends up in the water and pulled into a civilian rescuer\u2019s boat, Murphy fully sells just how shaken and damaged he\u2019s become in just a few hours \u2014 to tragic ends.\n\nA Quiet Place Part II (2020)\n\nIn a throwback to his early days as a post-apocalyptic survivor, Murphy appears in the A Quiet Place sequel, though now he\u2019s surviving aliens rather than zombies. As is his seeming trademark, Murphy is yet again a psychologically haunted man, as when we first meet him he\u2019s largely given up hope because his family died earlier in the alien invasion.\n\nWere it another actor but Murphy, playing tortured characters might get old after a while. But, he\u2019s just so good at it that it only makes sense to saddle him with the weight of the creation of the atomic bomb.\n\nOppenheimer opens exclusively in theaters on July 21."

It must be good\"\n\nWhile speculation of movie secrets and five of Hollywood's biggest hitters would be enough to cause anyone's Instagram to explode like an atom bomb, many people are more interested in the fact that Peaky Blinder's star Murphy is actually smiling.\n\nFans were probably relieved to see the usually reserved actor looking rather relaxed as recently spoke of the enormous pressure he felt taking on the his recent role.\n\nSpeaking to People about this significant undertaking Murphy stated: \u201cYou know that when you have those big roles, that responsibility, you feel it\u2019s kind of overwhelming.\u201d\n\nA weight certainly seems to have been lifted since wrapping production for Murphy and followers were keen to comment.\n\n\"Cillian wasn't just smiling, he's wide smiling. This doesn't feel right,\" one joked, while another also added: \"No way you got Cillian to pose like that.\"\n\nA third also wrote: \"Cillian can smile like that? It's Barbie effect y'all,\" while one follower gushed: \"What a dream it could be to be in this photo.\"\n\nThat final comment is a reference to now popular idea that people should make a double feature of the two most anticipated theatrical releases of the summer.\n\nNolan's film shares a release date with Greta Gerwig's Barbie, starring Aussie actress Margot Robbie.\n\nMany a meme has circulated online, with cinema-goers sharing their eagerness to see the two equally hyped yet polar opposite movies.\n\nThis odd pairing has become to be know as doing the \"Barbenheimer\"\n\nPlaying into the fun, Greta Gerwig and Robbie posed with their tickets to see Oppenheimer and Murphy responded in kind by encouraging people to see both releases on the same day.\n\nBoth Barbie and Oppenheimer hit cinemas 21st July"

    "text": "The 'Barbenheimer' weekend we have been waiting for is finally upon us. Greta Gerwig 's 'Barbie' starring Margot Robbie and Christopher Nolan 's ' Oppenheimer ' starring Cillian Murphy will bring the fan frenzy to theatres this Friday, making way for one epic box office battle.With regard to the hype and appeal for the new films, studios have released their predictions for the box office collections.Going by the early estimates, it seems that Barbie will top the opening weekend numbers keeping the 'A' rated Oppenheimer in second place.Barbie, led by Margot, is expected to bring in an estimated $95 million to $110 million from 4,200 North American theatres, stated a Variety report. Warner Bros. is projecting a more conservative $75 million to start, while rivals and exhibitors say it fetch an impressive $140 million weekend at the US box office. These numbers come in as a welcomed sign, considering that the movie cost an estimated $145 million to make.Meanwhile, Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer is predicted to earn a little less on its opening weekend, bringing in an estimated $50 million from 3,600 cinemas. Universal\u2019s historical biopic cost an estimated $100 million to make.While buzz around both movies is great, cinema halls are bracing themselves to be hit by a pink tsunami as 'Barbie' opens with a vast marketing campaign.Not even an actors' and writers' strike has been able to put brakes on the juggernaut, with Margot as Barbie, andRyan Gosling as her square-jawed boyfriend Ken, sending social media into a frenzy of fuchsia. With the movie hitting big screens across Europe on Wednesday, and North America on Friday, expectation is building at how director and indie film darling Greta Gerwig has tackled the subject of the doll who set unrealistic body standards for women."

    "text": "\"Cinema is thriving this summer,\" wrote a fan as photos of Margot Robbie and director Greta Gerwig posing with their movie tickets for 'Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning, Part One,' ' Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' and ' Oppenheimer .'In just a few days, fans will be left spoilt for choice as theatres get ready for one big showdown. Come July 12, the highly anticipated Tom Cruise film 'Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning, Part One' will arrive on the big screens.A week later, the film will clash with Margot's ' Barbie ' movie that also stars a host of actors, including Ryan Gosling in the lead.Interestingly, the colourful Gerta Gerwig directorial will clash head-on at the ticket windows with Christopher Nolan 's period drama 'Oppenheimer', based on the true story of the man who invented the atomic bomb.With the films ready to clash at the box office, it seems like there is no bad blood between the lead stars as they set out to the movie theatres with their directors to buy their tickets to the other's films.Cruise took the lead, giving his fellow Hollywood stars a 'Mission' to buy tickets to the four big summer blockbusters. \"This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theatres,\" the actor began in a tweet and went on to add, \"Congratulations, Harrison Ford , on 40 years of Indy and one of the most iconic characters in history.\"Cheering for his box office opponents, Cruise posted photos of himself posing with the ticket to the screenings of both Barbie and Oppenheimer. \"I love a double feature, and it doesn't get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Oppenheimer and Barbie,\" he tweeted.Shortly after, Margot and Greta also took to their handles to buy themselves four tickets to the summer blockbusters and captioned it as, \"Mission: Accepted!\"The photos of the celebs promoting each others' films got fans all hyped and excited to catch the upcoming films in theatres. \"We're loving this trend of stars & filmmakers supporting one another,\" wrote a fan.Another said, \"Seeing Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie with their tickets for #IndianaJones and the Dial of Destiny, #MissionImpossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1, and Oppenheimer is so awesome! We love movies! \"Another tweeted, \"Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie seated for Oppenheimer. supportive & I love it!\"The viral pictures prompted other another fan to ask Christopher Nolan to reciprocate the love in a tweet that read, \"I love that Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig are following after Tom Cruise\u2019s footsteps as they actively promote movies that are in direct competition with #BARBIE! Your turn Christopher Nolan and Cillian Murphy !\"A fan quipped, \"Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie just forced Christopher Nolan to do the unthinkable.\"The cross-promotion will be a welcome boost to the box office as Hollywood tentpoles outside of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse had underwhelming releases this past year."

    "text": "The stage has been set yet again for remarkable physical transformations by Hollywood actors as Cillian Murphy, aged 47, impresses audiences with his transformation for the upcoming blockbuster, Oppenheimer.\n\nHowever, the tactics deployed by Ciilian in achieving his new look, such as subsisting on just a single almond a day, may seem relatively tame by Hollywood standards.\n\nCillian's portrayal of the emaciated scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer, known for his diet of martinis and cigarettes, has caught the media's attention.\n\nCommenting on his drastic diet, the actor told The Guardian: \"I was running on crazy energy; I went over a threshold to where I was not worrying about food or anything. I was so in it, a state of hyper... hyper something, but it was good because the character was like that. He never ate.\"\n\n\u00a9 Getty Christian Bale\n\nChristian Bale\n\nHowever, Cillian\u2019s transformation is not the first instance of actors going to extreme lengths for their roles. Christian Bale, famously known for his drastic weight fluctuations, lost an astonishing 62lbs for his role in The Machinist.\n\nHe told GQ: \"Also, at the time I was engaged in a very filthy habit of smoking. So, I was rolling my own cigarettes and sitting there puffing away.\" This diet, comprising an apple, a tin of tuna, and black coffee, provided fewer than 200 calories per day, a significant departure from the recommended 2,500-calorie average for men.\n\nHis transformation did not go unnoticed, earning him a Best Actor nomination. However, the actor's pendulum-like physical changes have caught up with him. At the age of 45, he expressed concern about the impact of these extreme dieting practices on his health, stating: \"I just can't keep doing it. I really can't,\" he admitted. \"My mortality is staring me in the face.\"\n\n\u00a9 Target Presse Agentur Gmbh/Getty Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson attends the Germany premiere of \"'All Things Fall Apart\"\n\nCurtis '50 Cent' Jackson\n\nSimilar sacrifices were made by rapper and actor Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson for his role in All Things Fall Apart. The star shed a whopping 54lbs in just nine weeks for his portrayal of a cancer-stricken football player. Jackson achieved this dramatic weight loss through a liquid diet and three-hour daily treadmill workouts.\n\nExplaining his motivation, Curtis revealed the tragic backstory of his best friend Charles Pringle, who suffered from cancer. He told Parade Magazine: \"The weight started coming off, and my manager told me: 'You better get yourself to a doctor!' I just didn't want to go because I had to match the look in my mind.\"\n\n\u00a9 Gary Miller Matthew McConaughey at The Gentleman Q&A\n\nMatthew McConaughey\n\nAnother striking example is that of Matthew McConaughey, who lost 40lbs for his role in Dallas Buyers Club' He did this by consuming less than 500 calories per day, allowing him to portray the emaciated figure of a cowboy stricken with AIDS.\n\nBut the tables were turned in 2017 when Matthew needed to gain 47lbs for his role in Gold. During this time, he was labeled \"Captain Fun\" for his love of pizza nights and indulgence in cheeseburgers and beer.\n\n\u00a9 Getty Images Charlize Theron attends the Fast X film premiere, the tenth film in the Fast & Furious Saga, at Colosseum in Rome\n\nCharlize Theron\n\nCharlize Theron's weight journey was the inverse of Murphy's. For her role in Tully, she had to gain 50lbs in just three months. Reflecting on the experience, Theron confessed, \"And then, after three weeks, it's not fun anymore. Like, all of a sudden, you're done eating that amount and then it becomes a job.\" This transformation took a toll on Charlize's health as she expressed: \"I was very heavy, literally and figuratively. My soul just felt really heavy on this film, and I was just really unhealthy.\"\n\n\u00a9 Photo: Getty Images Chris Pratt\n\nChris Pratt\n\nChris Pratt's transformation from the lovable Andy Dwyer in Parks and Recreation to a muscular spacefarer in Guardians of the Galaxy is another remarkable instance. Chris, who lost 60lbs following a strict diet and exercise plan, said: \"I actually lost weight by eating more food, but eating the right food,\" he explained to PEOPLE magazine."

There\u2019s no question that \"Mission: Impossible\" will emerge as the summer box office champ \u2013 and quite possibly for the year \u2013 but what of \"Oppenheimer\" and \"Barbie\"?\n\nThis is Cork-born Murphy\u2019s first time at the top of a blockbuster, and it\u2019s got great advance word of mouth \u2013 no reviews yet, as they\u2019re still embargoed \u2013 but according to early industry tracking Barbie will likely beat \"Oppenheimer\" when it comes to earnings, at least in the first few days after opening.\n\n\"Barbie,\" based on the real-life Mattel doll, vs. \"Oppenheimer,\" based on the creator of the atomic bomb. Let\u2019s go!\n\n\u201cFrom Warner Bros., Barbie could open to a beatific $70 million to $80 million, if not more, according to sources who have access to tracking data (and there\u2019s plenty of upside). Warners is being more cautious, suggesting $60 million,\u201d according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n\u201cUniversal and (writer-director Christopher) Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer is tracking for a domestic debut in the $40 million range. For Oppenheimer \u2014 an R-rated, three-hour drama targeting adults \u2014 having legs could prove far more important than its opening weekend haul.\u201d\n\nOppenheimer has a top-tier cast that include Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh.\n\nBritish star Pugh said she was thrilled to work with Murphy: \u201cIt\u2019s a Christopher Nolan movie, number one, and number two, he has one of the most incredible leads.\n\n\"Cillian Murphy is an actor that I have been watching for quite some time and have been desperate to work with for ages. You\u2019d have to be mad to say no.\n\n\"It felt like I was playing sports with some of the best athletes, so it was truly one of the best experiences that I\u2019ve had,\u201d she recently told the press."

And, again, you\u2019re slightly jealous of that!\n\n\"There\u2019s the danger that over analyzing everything can erode the simplicity.\" Aran has also acted in the Andrew Legge-directed movie Lola.\n\nLittle is known about his future projects but Cillian and his family continue to live a low-key life in his home country of Ireland.\n\nThey made the decision to leave London eight years ago and he spoke to The Irish Sun about it: \"We were in London for 14 years, both our kids were born there and we only came back to Dublin in 2015,\" he said.\n\n\"It's kind of an Irish story to move away, do your thing and come home, that seems to be a common narrative for Irish people. And then we wanted the kids to be Irish.\"\n\n\u00a9 Robert Viglasky Cillian's son is following in his acting footsteps\n\nHe continued: \"They were sort of at that age where they were pre-teens, they had very posh English accents, and I wasn\u2019t appreciating that too much so we decided to come back. And you know, parents are at a certain age, it was just a nice time to come home.\"\n\nCillian is a family man, which made working on Peaky Blinders that much harder as for almost a decade, he was only home for half of the year at home as he filmed on location.\n\n\u00a9 Photo: Getty Images Cillian and his family relocated back to Dublin\n\nSpeaking to GQ, he said: \"That work-life balance thing is hard. I have an amazing wife and I couldn't do this without her and her understanding. But it is a struggle. \"He continued: \"I think it is for any dad whose work takes him away, which it generally does, and which consumes him, which my work does."

    "text": "While fans eagerly await the upcoming movie Oppenheimer, no one who has watched Peaky Blinders can forget Irish actor Cillian Murphy\u2019s iconic role in it. Playing the head of the Shelby family, Thomas \u201cTommy\u201d Shelby, Murphy has etched his alpha male persona in the minds of his fans. Needless to say, when an actor is as good as Murphy, it might get hard to differentiate between his onscreen image and the one that he carries off-screen. Talking about this difference and how fans interpret it, the actor shared what he thinks about it. According to him, fans are a little \u201cunderwhelmed\u201d by his real-life personality and it is all thanks to Thomas Shelby.\n\nFandomwire reported that Cillian Murphy is someone who does not like going out and about. In fact, the actor revealed that he is mostly at home or with his friends. Unless it is to promote one of his works, he does not even like being photographed. The actor said, \u201cI don\u2019t really partake. I don\u2019t go out. I\u2019m just at home mostly, or with my friends, unless I have a film to promote. I don\u2019t like being photographed by people. I find that offensive.\u201d\n\nThe actor went on to add that people expect him to be mysterious and charismatic like his on-screen persona from the hit family epic. However, the actor does not think that he could be more different than his character. Although he expressed that he is glad fans think of him that way. After all, for Murphy, it means that he is doing his job well. Fandomwire quoted him as saying, \u201cI think it\u2019s the Tommy Shelby thing. People expect this mysterious, swaggering, it\u2019s just a character. I do feel people are a little bit underwhelmed.\u201d He added, \u201cThat\u2019s fine, it means I\u2019m doing my job. Peaky fans are amazing. But sometimes I feel a little sad that I can\u2019t provide, like, that charisma and swagger. He couldn\u2019t be further from me.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Oppenheimer is set to hit the theatres on July 21. It will star Cillian Murphy in the titular role of Physicist J Robert Oppenheimer. The film will recount the events of how a team of scientists was involved in the Manhattan Project. It was these events that leads to the development of the atomic bomb."

    "text": "Si el verano cin\u00e9filo tuviese un nombre, ser\u00eda el de Barbieheimer, ese Rumble in the jungle de la gran pantalla que presenciaremos a partir del pr\u00f3ximo 21 de julio. Ese d\u00eda, llega a Espa\u00f1a Barbie, de Greta Gerwig: un d\u00eda despu\u00e9s de aterrizar en nuestro pa\u00eds Oppenheimer, la nueva pel\u00edcula de Christopher Nolan. El choque de fechas no ha entusiasmado, precisamente, al autor de Origen, seg\u00fan le han revelado a un periodista de Insider cuatro fuentes pr\u00f3ximas al director.\n\nEn el mismo reportaje, Nolan negaba que, por el momento, hubiese visto Barbie, lo que parece ser su manera de decirnos que no esperemos una fotograf\u00eda suya frente a la car\u00e1tula de esta pel\u00edcula mientras, con una sonrisa en la boca, agita en el aire una entrada de cine. Gerwig y Margot Robbie, en cambio, s\u00ed que han visto ya Oppenheimer. Y Cillian Murphy, que interpreta al padre de la bomba at\u00f3mica, espera devolverles pronto el favor.\n\n\u201cVoy a ver Barbie al 100%\u201d, dijo Murphy en una entrevista para IGN. \u201cCuento las horas para verla y creo que es espl\u00e9ndido para la industria, y para los espectadores, que el mismo d\u00eda se estrenen dos fant\u00e1sticas pel\u00edculas, dirigidas por dos fant\u00e1sticos cineastas\u201d.\n\nPuede que Nolan no simpatice con la opini\u00f3n del actor, con quien ha colaborado en seis pel\u00edculas incluida esta, pero si algo ha dejado claro Murphy desde que debutase en la gran pantalla hace veinticinco a\u00f1os es que \u00e9l es una estrella de cine diferente. O que, mejor dicho, \u00e9l es una estrella de cine, precisamente, porque ha hecho todo lo posible para evitarlo.\n\nCillian Murphy en 'Oppenheimer'. Yago Garc\u00eda Salmer\u00f3n\n\nEl rockero de las gafas de sol\n\nCualquiera que haya visto la serie Peaky Blinders recordar\u00e1 los ojos azules, p\u00e1lidos y absorbentes de Cillian Murphy. No hay unos ojos como los suyos en toda la industria del cine. Son su se\u00f1a de identidad, como lo era, para Kirk Douglas, el hoyuelo de su barbilla. Sin embargo, Murphy prefiere esconderlos tras unas gafas de sol siempre que tiene la posibilidad.\n\nEn una entrevista para ES Magazine, el irland\u00e9s hablaba de ello: simplemente, no le gusta que lo reconozcan. Para Murphy, el infierno debe tener un aspecto muy similar al de cientos y cientos de admiradores grit\u00e1ndote cuando sacas a pasear a tu perro. Por eso, Murphy, en su entrevista, se compadec\u00eda de Robert Pattinson, que ha padecido esta insufrible veneraci\u00f3n desde que protagonizase Crep\u00fasculo.\n\nCillian Murphy en 'Peaky Blinders' BBC\n\nSi hay el actor ha querido ser alguna vez una estrella, ha sido una estrella de rock: junto a su hermano, fund\u00f3 la banda The Sons of Mr. Green Genes, que estuvo cerca de firmar un acuerdo con un importante sello discogr\u00e1fico brit\u00e1nico. Los Murphy lo rechazaron: P\u00e1idi, el hermano menor de Cillian, no quer\u00eda dejar la universidad y la cantidad de dinero que percibir\u00edan no convenci\u00f3 al d\u00fao.\n\nSi albergas esperanzas de que retome su carrera musical, renuncia a ellas. No volveremos a ver a Tom Shelby con una guitarra el\u00e9ctrica: Cillian Murphy le dijo a un periodista de The Guardian que el mundo de la m\u00fasica se hab\u00eda cerrado para \u00e9l porque un int\u00e9rprete con una banda de rock no ser\u00eda tomado en serio por nadie. No sabemos si Keanu Reeves ley\u00f3 esa entrevista.\n\nTr\u00e1iler de 'OPPENHEIMER' - Cineman\u00eda Tr\u00e1iler de 'OPPENHEIMER' - Cineman\u00eda\n\nEn cambio, y adem\u00e1s de su amor imperecedero amor por Chet Baker y los Beatles, s\u00ed hay algo que Murphy ha mantenido de sus d\u00edas como cantante: su mujer Yvonne Guinness, a la que conoci\u00f3 en un concierto. Poco m\u00e1s se conoce sobre su vida privada: tienen dos hijos, ella es artista (se dedica a la videoinstalaci\u00f3n), \u00e9l es vegetariano y, en su infancia, fue cat\u00f3lico, pero ya no\u2026\n\n\u201cYvonne no habla de m\u00ed y yo no hablo de ella\u201d. As\u00ed es como Murphy suele zanjar toda cuesti\u00f3n referente a su vida al margen de las pantallas. Cuando le preguntaron si hab\u00eda colaborado alguna vez con Yvonne en una de sus exposiciones art\u00edsticas, el actor respondi\u00f3: \u201cTenemos dos hijos. Creo que eso ya es suficiente colaboraci\u00f3n por el momento\u201d.\n\nCillian Murphy en 'Luces rojas' Warner Bros.\n\nCillian no ha podido venir\n\nUno aprende a valorar a\u00fan m\u00e1s la interpretaci\u00f3n de Murphy en Peaky Blinders cuando descubre, o m\u00e1s bien entreve, al actor que se esconde bajo la peligrosa boina. Durante el rodaje de Oppenheimer en Nuevo M\u00e9xico, elenco y equipo t\u00e9cnico se reun\u00edan para cenar juntos. La ubicaci\u00f3n, pleno desierto, no ofrec\u00eda muchas m\u00e1s alternativas. Sin embargo, en estas cenas comunales sol\u00eda faltar alguien: nada m\u00e1s y nada menos que el propio Oppenheimer.\n\n'Oppenheimer' Cineman\u00eda\n\n\u201cLa presi\u00f3n y la responsabilidad que Cillian soport\u00f3 durante la grabaci\u00f3n fue monumental, y eso le imped\u00eda acompa\u00f1arnos al final del d\u00eda. Su cerebro estaba saturado\u201d. De esta forma lo excusaron lo actores Emily Blunt y Matt Damon. Bueno, seguro que no es el peor pretexto que se haya empleado hasta ahora para no hacer vida social con tus compa\u00f1eros de trabajo.\n\nEn una entrevista para Variety durante la promoci\u00f3n de Blonde, Ana de Armas apunt\u00f3 a que si el star-system de Hollywood se hab\u00eda desmoronado era, en parte, por las redes sociales. El misterio que rodeaba a la estrella de cine era una parte esencial en su naturaleza y, sin \u00e9l, no exist\u00eda.\n\nDe una industria poblada por Monroe, Wayne, Taylor y Dean, se ha pasado a un cine en el que s\u00f3lo Tom Cruise puede considerarse una aut\u00e9ntica estrella. Aunque, quiz\u00e1s, no deber\u00edamos perder de vista la candidatura de Cillian Murphy. Y eso que \u00e9l ha hecho todo lo posible para no convertirse en una.\n\nFotograma de 'Oppenheimer' Cineman\u00eda\n\n\u00bfQuieres recibir todos los viernes en tu correo las mejores recomendaciones de cine y series?

Fue al casting de Batman inicia, pero el director no lo eligi\u00f3, pens\u00f3 que sus ojos g\u00e9lidos eran perfectos para interpretar a El Espantap\u00e1jaros (Vianney Le Caer/Invision/AP)\n\n\u201cSent\u00ed que no era el correcto para Batman, pero sin embargo era alguien con quien quer\u00eda seguir creando, alguien con quien quer\u00eda trabajar\u201d, dijo en una entrevista de la \u00e9poca con IGN, y cumpli\u00f3 su palabra. Batman Inicia fue un \u00e9xito de cr\u00edtica y taquilla, con una recaudaci\u00f3n de casi US$100 millones y tambi\u00e9n la primera producci\u00f3n masiva con la que Murphy se abri\u00f3 camino en Hollywood. Fue adem\u00e1s el inicio de una colaboraci\u00f3n entre el director y el actor de entonces 28 a\u00f1os.

Murphy lo entendi\u00f3 desde el principio: \u201cSi Christopher Nolan te pide que hagas algo, independientemente de la envergadura del papel, lo hac\u00e9s\u201d, dijo en medio de la gira promocional de la pel\u00edcula para la que se prepar\u00f3 leyendo el texto sagrado hinduista Bhagavad Gita, de donde proviene la c\u00e9lebre cita que se le atribuye al f\u00edsico Robert J.

Cillian Murphy no descarta la idea tras el final de la exitosa serie\n\nPero nacido en un pueblo cat\u00f3lico de las afueras de Cork, en Irlanda, donde la m\u00e1xima atracci\u00f3n era la iglesia que le daba el nombre: Ballintemple (\u201cel pueblo de la Iglesia\u201d), el actor estaba lejos de haber sido educado como villano. Por el contrario, fue formado en los preceptos de la religi\u00f3n familiar y de los hermanos del colegio de curas en el que hizo la secundaria.\n\nEs cierto que durante la mayor parte del colegio tuvo problemas de conducta, pero cuando estaba en cuarto a\u00f1o descubri\u00f3 que pod\u00eda canalizar esa energ\u00eda por medio de sus inclinaciones art\u00edsticas. Prob\u00f3 con las clases de actuaci\u00f3n en Corcadorca, la compa\u00f1\u00eda de teatro de Cork, y por primera vez se sinti\u00f3 \u201cverdaderamente vivo\u201d, aunque en esa \u00e9poca su mayor ambici\u00f3n era convertirse en una estrella de rock. Cantaba y tocaba la guitarra en una banda que form\u00f3 junto a P\u00e1idi, uno de sus tres hermanos; y hasta les ofrecieron un contrato para grabar cuatro \u00e1lbumes que el d\u00fao rechaz\u00f3 porque les parec\u00eda poca plata a cambio de los derechos de \u201csus peculiares temas y sus solos interminables\u201d, como \u00e9l mismo los defini\u00f3. Pod\u00edan permit\u00edrselo; a diferencia de la infancia de privaciones de su Thomas Shelby de Peaky Blinders, Cillian creci\u00f3 en una familia relativamente acomodada: su padre trabajaba en el departamento de Educaci\u00f3n de su distrito, y su madre era profesora de franc\u00e9s.\n\nCillian Thomas como Thomas Shelby en Peaky Blinder, la serie de Netflix que lo llev\u00f3 al gran p\u00fablico y por la que tuvo que dejar de ser vegetariano, luego de veinte a\u00f1os sin comer carne, para poder sumar prote\u00ednas a su dieta (Zuma Press/The Grosby Group)\n\nEn 1996, a los 20 a\u00f1os \u2013naci\u00f3 el 25 de mayo de 1976\u2013, Murphy entr\u00f3 a la Facultad de Derecho de Cork, pero no aprob\u00f3 un solo examen. Alguna vez explic\u00f3 que ni siquiera se lo propuso, realmente no quer\u00eda ser abogado. Ya hab\u00eda desistido de la idea de dedicarse a la m\u00fasica, pero el bichito de la actuaci\u00f3n que le hab\u00eda picado en el colegio se acrecent\u00f3 despu\u00e9s de ver una obra de su profesor del Corcadorca y tuvo su primer papel importante junto al club de drama amateur de la Universidad. Sin embargo, su motivaci\u00f3n por esos d\u00edas era, seg\u00fan cont\u00f3 m\u00e1s tarde, la de muchos otros chicos de su edad: \u201cIr a fiestas y conocer mujeres\u201d.\n\nAs\u00ed fue como consigui\u00f3 entrar oficialmente a Corcadorca, donde actu\u00f3 en varias obras y lleg\u00f3 a irse de gira por Europa, Australia y Canad\u00e1 con Disco Pigs, que tambi\u00e9n fue adaptada al cine y le vali\u00f3 los primeros elogios de la prensa especializada. As\u00ed llegar\u00eda tambi\u00e9n su debut cinematogr\u00e1fico, precisamente en 28 d\u00edas despu\u00e9s, de Danny Boyle, donde Nolan le ech\u00f3 el ojo.

Lo que la directora de casting hab\u00eda encontrado en \u00e9l no era muy distinto de lo que pronto descubrir\u00eda el director de Oppenheimer: \u201cMurphy era t\u00edmido en el set, con una tendencia a mirar ligeramente por fuera de la c\u00e1mara, ten\u00eda un tipo so\u00f1ador y algo falto de energ\u00eda, como si flotara, que era fant\u00e1stico para la pel\u00edcula\u201d. Por ese trabajo logr\u00f3 su primera nominaci\u00f3n como Revelaci\u00f3n Masculina en los MTV Movie Awards de 2004.\n\nVolvi\u00f3 al cine con su compatriota Colin Farrell en la comedia negra Intermission (2004), que se convirti\u00f3 en ese momento en el film independiente de origen irland\u00e9s de mayor recaudaci\u00f3n en la historia. Y la cr\u00edtica volvi\u00f3 a hablar de sus ojos g\u00e9lidos: \u201cSu intensidad es totalmente cre\u00edble; sus miradas delicadas, junto a su talento y expertise, son lo que hace que hoy la gente lo se\u00f1ale como el nuevo Farrell de Irlanda, aunque en una versi\u00f3n m\u00e1s sobria\u201d, dijo el Herald Tribune.\n\nCillian Murphy como el Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer en una escena del film y el f\u00edsico en una foto de \u00e9poca en el campo de pruebas de la bomba at\u00f3mica cerca de Alamogordo, Nuevo M\u00e9xico (Universal Pictures y AP)\n\nEsa apariencia misteriosa le permiti\u00f3 a Murphy sostenerse como una rara avis en Hollywood, a donde nunca quiso mudarse: no tiene agente, ni un entorno cerrado que lo acompa\u00f1e a todas partes, y suele v\u00e9rselo solo y con impecable estilismo \u2013fue nombrado entre los 50 Mejor Vestidos de GQ en 2015\u2013 en las premi\u00e8res. Casi no da entrevistas (hasta hace una d\u00e9cada se negaba incluso a ir a programas de televisi\u00f3n para promocionar sus pel\u00edculas), detesta las alfombras rojas, y asegura que practica intencionalmente una vida que no le interesa a los tabloides.\n\n\u201cNo genero controversias, no me acuesto con nadie por ah\u00ed, no me caigo borracho en lugares\u201d, le dijo a The Sunday Times en 2004. Ya se destacaba por ser lo opuesto de su amigo Farrel \u2013de los pocos que cuenta en el ambiente adem\u00e1s de los tambi\u00e9n irlandeses Jonathan Rhys Meyers y Liam Neeson, a quien llama su padre cinematogr\u00e1fico\u2013. Ese mismo a\u00f1o se cas\u00f3 con su novia de toda la vida, la artista visual Yvonne McGuinness, a quien conoci\u00f3 en un show de su banda en 1996. Vivieron juntos en Londres hasta 2015, cuando se instalaron en Dublin con sus hijos, Malachy (que naci\u00f3 en diciembre de 2005) y Aran (en julio de 2007).\n\nCillian Murphy con uno de sus hijos, en 2007, en una de las pocas fotos que los paparazzi han logrado (The Grosby Group)\n\nHasta hace poco, ninguno de sus dos hijos, hoy adolescentes, estaba familiarizado con el trabajo de su padre, m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de saber que era actor. Ni Murphy ni su mujer quer\u00edan exponerlos a la violencia de los papeles que suele desempe\u00f1ar, as\u00ed que ni siquiera ve\u00edan sus pel\u00edculas. Lo que saben de su padre es que es ese tipo afable que disfruta del tiempo en casa, con ellos, y encuentra placer \u201cen sacar la basura y ser parte del d\u00eda a d\u00eda en familia\u201d.\n\nAlgo s\u00ed tiene en com\u00fan con su mafioso Tom Shelby y es el valor que le da a su c\u00edrculo cercano, su familia y esas personas que estaban ah\u00ed antes de que se hiciera conocido. \u201cMi vida es surreal. Hay que darse cuenta de la suerte que ten\u00e9s y no darla por hecha. Este es un negocio dif\u00edcil y ya estar trabajando es un m\u00e9rito. Por eso amo volver a Cork y estar con mis amigos de siempre. Con ellos nunca hablo de la industria, porque no nos parece un asunto importante. No es relevante entre amigos que se conocen desde los diez a\u00f1os\u201d, le dijo hace tiempo al Irish Independent. Poco m\u00e1s se sabe de su vida privada salvo eso: que prefiere reservarla para su intimidad.\n\nTe puede interesar: \u201cOppenheimer\u201d demuestra su grandeza visual en un explosivo clip in\u00e9dito\n\nCillian Murphy durante el Festival de Cannes: cumple con los compromisos de promoci\u00f3n de las pel\u00edculas pero detesta las alfombras rojas (Carlo Allegri/Getty Images)\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 fue primero, su halo de misterio natural o la convicci\u00f3n de preservar su mudo privado a rajatabla? Nadie puede saberlo igual que nadie sabe bien qu\u00e9 esconden sus ojos de hielo, esos capaces de \u201ccortar diamantes\u201d, como los describe la revista Night and Day. Cuando Nolan descubri\u00f3 su perfil m\u00e1s oscuro, le llovieron las nominaciones como Mejor Villano. El cr\u00edtico del New Yorker David Denby escribi\u00f3 despu\u00e9s de ver a su Espantap\u00e1jaros \u2013o la representaci\u00f3n misma del miedo\u2013: \u201cTiene una mirada angelical que puede tornarse siniestra; es uno de los monstruos m\u00e1s elegantemente seductores del cine reciente\u201d.\n\nLa sensaci\u00f3n era un\u00e1nime. Ese lugar de \u00e1ngel negro le valdr\u00eda muchos otros trabajos: de nuevo con Nolan; como el temible soldado del IRA Damien O\u2019Donovan en la premiada The wind that shakes the barney (2006), de Ken Loach; o, m\u00e1s recientemente, como el sobreviviente perturbado de A quiet place II (2021).\n\nMurphy mostro su talento actoral no dej\u00e1ndose encasillar. Prob\u00f3 su versatilidad como una mujer trans irlandesa en la comedia dram\u00e1tica Desayuno en Plut\u00f3n (2005)\n\nPero Murphy nunca se dej\u00f3 encasillar. Prob\u00f3 su versatilidad como una mujer trans irlandesa en la comedia dram\u00e1tica Desayuno en Plut\u00f3n (2005), la pel\u00edcula con la que Neil Jordan intent\u00f3 reivindicarse ante la comunidad despu\u00e9s de El juego de las l\u00e1grimas (1992). Para ese papel se prepar\u00f3 mont\u00e1ndose y yendo a clubs de crossdressers, aunque una vez m\u00e1s, ya llevaba en el cuerpo lo que se requer\u00eda: su look andr\u00f3gino era insuperable y verlo transformarse en una drag rubia en la pantalla parec\u00eda absolutamente natural.\n\nEn cambio s\u00ed tuvo que forzar su apariencia para la interpretaci\u00f3n que lo meti\u00f3 desde 2013 en las casas del gran p\u00fablico, como el jefe gangster de Birmingham en Peaky Blinders (el final de la serie fue visto por 3,7 millones de espectadores). No s\u00f3lo el acento \u201cbrummie\u201d, casi imposible de imitar, que ensay\u00f3 hasta la obsesi\u00f3n yendo a los pubs locales, donde grababa a los habitu\u00e9s \u2013\u201d\u00cdbamos a tomar unas Guinness y todos cantaban canciones del Birmingham City y contaban historias que yo registraba en mi iPhone. Y cuando llegaba a casa, rastreaba cada acento y los probaba. Le dejaba mensajes a Steve (Knight, el creador de la serie brit\u00e1nica) imit\u00e1ndolos para que se fijara lo cerca que estaba de sacarlo\u201d\u2013, sino su figura, hasta entonces m\u00e1s bien desgarbada, que tuvo que cambiar radicalmente para mostrarse m\u00e1s fuerte.\n\nLos actores Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Cillian Murphy y Florence Pugh en la premiere de Oppenheimer (EFE/EPA/ANDY RAIN)\n\nEse fue otro sacrificio que le exigi\u00f3 el rol de Thomas Shelby: tuvo que dejar de ser vegetariano luego de veinte a\u00f1os sin comer carne para poder sumar prote\u00ednas a su dieta. \u201cYo no era una persona f\u00edsicamente imponente, no lo soy. Y tengo que comer much\u00edsimas prote\u00ednas y levantar much\u00edsimo peso para lograrlo. Todo eso me lleva tiempo, y lo detesto\u201d, confi\u00f3 a Radio Times en una de las pocas notas que concedi\u00f3 para promocionar la \u00faltima temporada de Peaky Blinders, donde mantuvo una vez m\u00e1s aquello de hablar s\u00f3lo de su vida profesional.\n\nEs lo mismo que hace ahora durante la rueda por el estenos de Oppenheimer, donde se centra \u00fanicamente en su personaje, en su relaci\u00f3n con el director que le dio su primera gran oportunidad y en c\u00f3mo los dos se comprometieron a retratar la inmensa inteligencia y los conflictos morales del f\u00edsico: \u201cSiempre and\u00e1bamos buscando la complejidad de Oppenheimer, porque no era un tipo simple \u2013le dijo a Marca\u2013. Tener esa gran inteligencia puede ser una carga; la gente as\u00ed opera en un plano completamente diferente al de los meros mortales como nosotros, y eso conlleva sus propias complicaciones y desaf\u00edos en su vida personal y moral. Eso fue uno de los retos m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles: trazar el viaje moral de Oppenheimer a trav\u00e9s de la historia, porque se mueve por terreno cenagoso en t\u00e9rminos de lo que le puede plantear su trabajo en el Proyecto Manhattan y luego, a\u00f1os m\u00e1s tarde, su posici\u00f3n respecto a la pol\u00edtica nuclear despu\u00e9s de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, y c\u00f3mo ir cambiando de postura y evolucionando lo hace entrar en conflicto con otra gente\u201d.\n\n\u201cSiempre and\u00e1bamos buscando la complejidad de Oppenheimer, porque no era un tipo simple. Tener esa gran inteligencia puede ser una carga; la gente as\u00ed opera en un plano completamente diferente al de los meros mortales como nosotros\", dijo antes de la premiere de Oppenheimer\n\nTambi\u00e9n acept\u00f3 sus limitaciones frente a la figura hist\u00f3rica que interpret\u00f3: \u201cLa mayor\u00eda de las personas no pueden pensar ni piensan en la existencia humana, la estructura del mundo y nuestro lugar en el universo del modo en que lo hac\u00eda Oppenheimer, a trav\u00e9s de la lente de la mec\u00e1nica cu\u00e1ntica, con sus complejidades y su aprecio por las paradojas\u201d. Por eso, seg\u00fan explic\u00f3 en la misma nota \u201chubiera sido absurdo\u201d para \u00e9l intentar entenderlo todo. \u201cBasta con tratar de entender vagamente los conceptos para luego profundizar en eso y extraer la humanidad, que es lo que de verdad importa para nuestra pel\u00edcula\u201d, dijo.\n\nPero el lado m\u00e1s humano de Murphy sigue estando reservado para unos pocos elegidos. A dos d\u00e9cadas de su desembarco en la industria, logr\u00f3 instalarse con sus propias reglas, siempre alejado de la carnicer\u00eda de los tabloides, jam\u00e1s revelando nada que no quisiera. Sabe que la clave de ese triunfo personal tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 escrita en su mirada, esa que a veces lo separa tambi\u00e9n a \u00e9l del resto de los mortales. Ciertamente, sabe que fue m\u00e1s fuerte que el acento local y el entrenamiento a la hora de volver cre\u00edble el poder de su criatura m\u00e1s famosa y tambi\u00e9n vale para imponerse ante la prensa con su distancia elegante: \u201cEs la manera en la que mira a las personas. Esa quietud, su frialdad, lo que los paraliza\u201d.\n\nSeguir leyendo:"

    "text": "Barbenheimer and Beyond: Hollywood's Greatest Box Office Showdowns\n\nAs the battle of Barbenheimer is decided, we look back on some other classic pairings of films that came out on the same day\n\nImage by Hamza Rasheed\n\nPublished Jul 20, 2023\n\nWhen Warner Bros. Pictures announced the release date for Barbie at CinemaCon in April 2022, eagle-eyed film fans were quick to note that Oppenheimer 's release date, which was announced in late 2021, was scheduled for the same weekend. As July 21, 2023 approached, Barbie's marketing painted cities pink and the internet delighted in sharing memes of the famously introverted Cillian Murphy, Oppenheimer's lead, minding his own business. The diametrically opposed movies offer something for everyone, but their box office battle is more than just a pink explosion for the internet.As pandemic-induced restrictions began to ease, Warner Bros. announced that their entire 2021 slate was going to be released simultaneously in theatres and on HBO Max (as it was then called). In response, Christopher Nolan, one of the studio's most prominent directors, was outspoken in his criticism of the move, describing the decision as making \"no economic sense.\" Although WB was Nolan's home for the better part of 20 years, it was of little surprise that he began shopping his latest film to other studios after their public falling out. It's of even littler surprise that his former employer has decisively pulled out all the stops in their counter-programming strategy.\"Barbenheimer\" isn't the first time two big titles face off at the box office \u2014 it isn't even the first time Universal Pictures, Warner Bros. and Nolan have danced this dance. From '80s tentpoles to Christmas fare, we look back at some of the greatest (and most curious) box office showdowns in cinema history.As for Barbie vs. Oppenheimer, who will come out on top is anyone's guess. Nolan's fanbase is ardent and IMAX-happy, but it's hard to discount the fact that Barbie feels like a moment. For my money, it's a peculiarly excellent double feature waiting to happen: come on, Oppy, let's go party.While the box office numbers may seem wildly lopsided, it's important to note that The Shining only released on 10 screens during the Memorial Day weekend compared to The Empire Strikes Back's 126 theatres (the latter also began showing in cinemas two days earlier). Empire would go on to be the top domestic grossing film of 1980 (The Shining was twelfth) and set a new standard for how good sequels could be \u2014 but Stanley Kubrick's iconic film, though met with mixed reviews on its initial release, is now considered a bonafide classic in its own right.There are many films that can be considered decade-defining in the '80s, but Ghostbusters and Gremlins represented a shift in the horror genre with the addition of pure comedy; perhaps in keeping with the tubular '80s, viewers looked for the humour in even the most terrifying scenes. However, for some parents, Gremlins took this concept a bit too far, with many not realizing the film was not suitable for children, prompting many to walk out before the film ended that opening weekend. It's rather fitting that two films so emblematic of the decade would be released on the same weekend, with just $1.1 million separating the two.Considering Point Break opened in twice the amount of theatres as Boyz n the Hood, John Singleton's seminal film is the emphatic winner in this SoCal movie competition. Although the two films have a shared location (sort of), Boyz n the Hood's authentic exploration of a much-maligned neighbourhood has cemented it as an American classic, while Point Break continues to delight as a pulpy cop thriller. Neither film toppled Terminator 2: Judgment Day in its second weekend (or earned more than the fourth theatrical re-release of 101 Dalmatians), but they are still beloved by audiences today, albeit for very different reasons.On the surface, it feels like an unfair comparison. The Matrix was one of the biggest cinematic events in the '90s and had an instant impact on pop culture that continues to resonate today. But in 1999, the teen high school comedy really was all the rage. Similar to how I imagine the crowds for Barbie and Oppenheimer will be, The Matrix brought out all the sci-fi boys to the yard, while 10 Things I Hate About You seemed destined to fulfill the angst-ridden high schooler of the day. Both movies have continued to find life beyond their theatrical releases, but one was just on a slightly larger scale than the other.The tale of two Christmases, Elf and Love Actually appeal to different sides of the yuletide from different sides of the pond. Given that Love Actually is a distinctly British film, it's surprising that it was released in the US and Canada two weeks ahead of the UK (where Love Actually topped Elf). Canadian and American audiences were decidedly Team Buddy upon their debuts, but both films have found a place in many households during Christmas. (Fun fact: The Matrix Revolutions was also released on this day and took the top spot at the box office that weekend with $48 million.)Christopher Nolan, Universal Pictures and Warner Bros. were once again behind the ultimate counter-programming move, although the parties were all on different sides than for today's Oppenheimer/Barbie showdown. Nolan and WB were in the midst of their successful partnership, and excitement was exceptionally high for the director's follow-up to 2005's Batman Begins. Universal, in a bid to cut into their competitor's box office receipts, released a rom-com musical, but to no avail. Not only did The Dark Knight crush Mamma Mia! in its opening weekend, it also became the top-grossing film of the year, crossing the $1 billion mark worldwide."

    "text": "Do you hear the term \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d a lot these days? There are times in the ever-changing film business that completely transform the processes of film production, distribution, and reception. July 21, 2023, marked one such milestone, with the emergence of an Internet phenomenon known as \u201cBarbenheimer.\u201d This viral sensation revolved around two films with seemingly opposite genres and themes \u2013 \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d \u2013 both set to hit theaters simultaneously. As the amalgamation of these titles suggests, the trend captured the attention of millions, showcasing the powerful impact of social media on shaping the film industry\u2019s future.\n\nThe term \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d was coined by online fandoms, who quickly embraced the dual theatrical release of the two movies. Through hashtags, memes, and creative fan-made content, social media became the driving force behind the success of this cinematic experiment. The interplay between die-hard fans, curious cinephiles, and casual moviegoers led to an unprecedented buzz, leading to an influx of bookings across theaters worldwide.\n\nI've been seeing a lot of incredible fan art, mashups and parody posters for what is now known as \"Barbenheimer\". Felt inspired and thought I'd join in on the fun! So here's a little Photoshop fun by me for the DOUBLE FEATURE OF THE CENTURY! \ud83d\udc60\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\ude0e pic.twitter.com/qUmDkbIMso \u2014 Steve Reeves (@stevereevesart) July 11, 2023\n\nAMC Theaters, one of the largest cinema chains, exemplified the tangible influence of social media on this unique event. More than 20,000 of their AMC Stubs members proudly proclaimed their intent to witness both films on the same day. The phenomenon sparked conversations and debates that extended far beyond cinema seats, permeating various online platforms, news outlets, and even academic discussions.\n\nBut what exactly were the implications of Barbenheimer, and how did social media facilitate this groundbreaking marketing success? As industry experts delve into the matter, several key factors come to light. The intertwining of social media and film promotion has proven to be a potent force, capable of not only generating hype but also shaping the narrative surrounding these movies.\n\nThrough interactive campaigns, directors, producers, and studios harnessed the power of user-generated content, turning fans into enthusiastic brand ambassadors. As audiences shared their anticipation, speculations, and personal connections to both Barbie and Oppenheimer, the films acquired a life of their own, transforming into cultural touchstones even before their official release.\n\nAdditionally, the ease of communication on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube facilitated instant feedback loops. Filmmakers could gauge public sentiment and adjust their marketing strategies accordingly, creating a symbiotic relationship with their audience. The barrier between creators and consumers blurred, opening up new possibilities for more inclusive storytelling.\n\nAs we explore the realm of Barbenheimer and social media\u2019s impact on the film industry, this blog post will delve into the underlying mechanisms that made this viral event possible. From the role of online fandoms in shaping modern cinema to the influence of social media in constructing movie identities, we aim to provide an expert analysis of the convergence between art, marketing, and the digital age.\n\nWhat is Barbenheimer?\n\nBarbenheimer is a portmanteau of the words \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d two major summer blockbusters that are set to be released on the same weekend, July 21, 2023. Fans first argued about whether the film was better and which one they would watch, but then wondered, \u201cWhy not both?\u201d As a result, the name \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d was coined, and viewers promised to sit through both films in their entirety on the same day. Fans even created a trailer for it!\n\nThe popularity of the fad on the internet has helped make it a marketing success. For instance, AMC Theatres stated that more than 20,000 of its AMC Stubs members had purchased tickets to see both films on the same day. Barbenheimer became so popular that even merchants began to be made about it. When you go to a movie right now, you\u2019re more likely to see one of these than just the Oppenheimer t-shirt.\n\nmy tshirt arrived pic.twitter.com/U5UHZpGfSc \u2014 laila \ud83c\udf3fTHREE TIME EMMY NOMINEE PEDRO PASCAL (@falconsnat) June 29, 2023\n\nHere are some of the reasons why Barbenheimer is trending:\n\nThe two films are both major blockbusters that are set to be released on the same weekend.\n\nThe films are very different from each other, which has created a lot of anticipation and debate about which film will be more successful.\n\nThe term Barbenheimer is catchy and easy to remember, which has helped it to spread quickly on social media.\n\nThe dating trend that has been dubbed \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d is also generating a lot of buzz.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how Barbenheimer plays out in the coming weeks and months. Will it become a box office success? Will it become a lasting cultural phenomenon? Only time will tell.\n\nActors also love the idea of \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d\n\nActors from both \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and \u201cBarbie\u201d seem enthusiastic about the idea; in fact, \u201cBarbie\u201d star Margot Robbie has already planned out her ideal \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d weekend.\n\nAt Wednesday\u2019s London premiere of her film, Robbie said, \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect double bill.\u201d In my opinion, \u201cI think actually start your day with \u2018Barbie,\u2019 then go straight into \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 and then a \u2018Barbie\u2019 chaser.\u201d\n\nRyan Gosling, who plays Ken in \u201cBarbie,\u201d agreed, stating he would first watch \u201cBarbie,\u201d then \u201c\u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 for lunch,\u201d and then \u201cBarbie\u201d again.\n\nCillian Murphy, who plays the protagonist in \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d told IGN that he \u201c100 percent\u201d intended to see \u201cBarbie\u201d and that Barbenheimer was \u201cjust great for the industry and for audiences \u2026 you can spend the whole day in the cinema. What\u2019s better than that?\u201d\n\nSocial media\u2019s effect on the film industry and marketing\n\nBarbenheimer is just the latest example of social media\u2019s effect on the film industry and marketing. Social media has revolutionized the film industry and transformed how movies are marketed and experienced. Here are some key ways in which social media has had a profound effect on the film industry and its marketing strategies:\n\nAudience engagement and interaction: Social media platforms provide an unprecedented opportunity for filmmakers and studios to engage directly with their audience. Through official accounts, hashtags, and live Q&A sessions, filmmakers can interact with fans, respond to questions, and build a sense of community. This engagement fosters a deeper emotional connection between the audience and the film, driving anticipation and word-of-mouth marketing.\n\nSocial media platforms provide an unprecedented opportunity for filmmakers and studios to engage directly with their audience.

Crowdsourced marketing and user-generated content: Audiences have become active participants in film marketing through user-generated content (UGC). Fans create memes, trailers, and promotional videos, sharing them across social media platforms, effectively becoming co-creators of the movie\u2019s marketing campaign. This organic sharing enhances the film\u2019s visibility, authenticity, and credibility.\n\nHow AI and big data analytics are changing influencer marketing\n\nIn conclusion, social media\u2019s effect on the film industry and marketing has been transformative. It has empowered audiences, broken down barriers between filmmakers and fans, and opened up new avenues for creativity and engagement. As social media platforms continue to evolve, the film industry must adapt and harness the power of these digital tools to stay connected with audiences and drive success in an ever-competitive landscape.\n\nFeatured image credit: DiscussingFilm"

Everyone on the internet was making jokes and having a fun time.\n\nUntil the middle of the week, when United States Senators and their social media teams entered the joke landscape.\n\nAs best we can tell, the virus began on Tuesday, when Will, a student at Tufts, tweeted the following.\n\nWhich of your state\u2019s senators is seeing the Barbie and which is seeing Oppenheimer?

One film, after all, is about a plastic doll and her boyfriend. The other is about Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who helped the United States develop the first nuclear bomb and changed the course of the Second World War.\n\nGiven the enduring popularity of Barbie, it's maybe no great surprise that her first outing on the big screen is expected to emerge triumphant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's predicted to gross between $70 million and $80 million on its first three days in US theaters, according to internal projections from Warner Bros. seen by The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThat's as much as double the $40 million that Universal Pictures expects \"Oppenheimer\" to take in the same period, per the report. (Part of the discrepancy may be length: \"Oppenheimer\" runs for three hours, which means theaters can't squeeze in as many screenings of it as they can of \"Barbie,\" which comes in at a touch under two hours.)\n\nCillian Murphy plays the nuclear physicist in \"Oppenheimer.\" Eamonn McCormack/Getty Images\n\nWhile both movies cost about $100 million to make, the marketing hype for \"Barbie\" continues to amaze many observers. There's even a full-scale replica of Barbie's Malibu Dream house listed on Airbnb.\n\nNo matter who wins, the feud may be less contentious than audiences have been led to believe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCritics point out that the competing releases are a top-notch example of \"counter-programming\" by both studios \u2013 a reference to simultaneously releasing titles that'll appeal to very different audiences.\n\nThe biggest audience for Gerwig's film, which stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, is likely to be women under 35, per The Hollywood Reporter. The trade publication points out that it's the same demographic that helped turn the \"Mamma Mia\" and \"Sex and the City\" movies into box-office monsters.\n\nNolan, meanwhile, will be hoping that his latest feature, which boasts an A-list cast, erases memories of \"Tenet,\" which bombed after being released in theaters (at his insistence) at the height of the pandemic in 2020.\n\nOf course, as Ryan Gilbey notes for The Guardian, \"there will be some overlap between their audiences.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if you are planning on catching them on the same day, my Insider colleagues Rebecca Cohen and Chris Panella have come up with the perfect schedule for a Barbenheimer double bill, no matter which you see first.\n\nAs they point out: \"While 'Barbie' calls for fruity cocktails and clubbing with the girls, 'Oppenheimer' gives off more of a black coffee and cigarette energy.\"\n\nWhichever film takes the weekend, it's unlikely that either one will beat out \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie,\" which had the best debut of the year. The Nintendo flick is also the highest-grossing film of 2023, making more than $1.3 billion globally.\n\n\"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\" and \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" both made it into nine figures on their opening weekends, taking $120 million and $118 million respectively, according to Comscore figures reported by Variety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOverall it's been a much better year for theaters, with US ticket sales sitting just over $4.3 billion at the six-month mark \u2013 up by 20% over 2022, per Comscore.\n\nThat's before the release of more blockbusters, including \"Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\" and, of course, \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer.\"\n\nAnd no matter what happens on July 21, one thing is certain: As David Gross, who writes a box office newsletter, told The New York Times: \"Audiences are going to find them, and both films are going to do extremely well.\""

Robert Oppenheimer) and Greta Gerwig's movie \"Barbie\" (about the Mattel doll) are both being released on the same day has delighted fans. People are creating schedules for back-to-back viewings. There are plans for what to eat and drink. There are even plans on what to wear.\n\nAnd then there are the memes.\n\nIn an interview with BBC Radio 1 on July 18, Margot Robbie, who stars as Barbie in the titular movie, and Ryan Gosling, who plays Ken, shared their thoughts on the \"Barbenheimer\" memes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked if she had seen the memes, Robbie said that her friends have been sending her a lot of them. \"People are so clever, people who come up with those funny memes,\" she said.\n\nAt the end of the interview, Gosling managed to create a new meme all by himself when he asked, \"What is a meme?\"\n\nTwitter users were quick to pick up on Gosling's reference to \"Oppenheimer\" actor Cillian Murphy, who once asked the same question in an interview with NME.\n\n\"He knew exactly what he was doing there,\" tweeted one user.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Ali showing once again why he's the best at this. Congrats on the birth of a new meme,\" tweeted another.\n\nMeanwhile, Twitter users were creating memes of their own.\n\n\"I feel like this is the Grimace Shake, but for #Barbenheimer. I obviously loved it,\" one user tweeted, referring to the recent viral McDonald's Grimace Shake trend.\n\n\"I love that fans are taking the oppenheimer press into their own hands,\" read another tweet referencing ths smoking pink Barbie house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTikTok users are also creating videos to celebrate the release. The #Barbenheimer hashtag currently has 109 million views.\n\nOne user, who goes by the username @alysilverio, shared a video of a Barbie-themed party she'd thrown. The caption read, \"pov: you throw a barbie themed party and the boys show up like this.\"\n\nIn the video, the men walk through the door wearing flat caps and waistcoats, presumably representing characters from \"Oppenheimer.\" They are greeted by a group of women dressed entirely in pink.\n\nOne of the women is holding a Barbie-themed cake, which the TikTok creator made in a previous TikTok video.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You mean peaky blinders?\" the top comment read.\n\nAnother comment read, \"Wow, that's so Ken of them actually.\"\n\nIn another video that has 3.5 million views, Tess Donatello, who goes by the TikTok username @tessdonatello, showed herself taking off her black \"Oppenheimer\"-themed outfit, to reveal her pink Barbie-themed outfit underneath.\n\n\"BYE THIS ATE,\" read the top comment, which has 59,700 likes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWarner Bros. predicts that \"Barbie\" will take up to $80 million in its first three days \u2014 about double the $40 million that Universal Pictures expects \"Oppenheimer\" to take in the same period.\n\nSources told Insider's Jason Guerrasio that \"Oppenheimer\" writer and director Christopher Nolan wasn't thrilled the studio wanted to release \"Barbie\" the same weekend as \"Oppenheimer.\"\n\nIn a recent interview with Guerrasio about whether \"Barbenheimer\" is \"strictly pettiness\" by Warner Bros, Nolan said, \"Now, you must know I'm not going to answer that question, only to say those who care about the theatrical experience, we've been longing for a crowded marketplace with a lot of different movies. That's what theaters have now, and those of us who care about movies are thrilled about that.\"\n\nThere's still time for even more memes and videos to surface before both movies are released on July 21. The fun has just begun."

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMillions of people are buzzing to see \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" this weekend \u2014 a cinematic showdown and pop-culture phenomenon dubbed \"Barbenheimer\" by some. Warren Buffett has nodded to both the iconic doll and the father of the atomic bomb over the years.\n\nThe famed investor debuted a set of four exclusive Barbies during Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in 2000. The dolls were cobranded with See's Candies, the Berkshire-owned confectioner that Buffett has hailed as his dream business.\n\nA glamorous blonde assistant in a See's Candies uniform brought two of the dolls to the stage where Buffett and his business partner, Charlie Munger, were seated. She pecked Munger on the cheek, prompting Buffett to quip, \"It's just a sample of what it's like to be an officer at Berkshire.\"\n\n\"This is the new See's Barbie doll,\" Buffett declared. \"And believe it or not, we've come up with three more just like this young woman.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We wanted our shareholders to be the first ones to have a shot at this new product,\" the Berkshire CEO continued, adding cheekily, \"The model is not included.\"\n\nThe lighthearted moment can be watched in full on CNBC's Warren Buffett Archive.\n\nOn a far more serious note, Buffett has frequently touched on J. Robert Oppenheimer's signature creation, the atomic bomb. He's repeatedly underscored the immense threat that nuclear weapons pose to the world.\n\n\"I've been concerned since 1945 when the first atomic bomb was used,\" Buffett said in 2017. \"We have developed over these 72 years, since August of 1945, the ability around the world to almost destroy civilization.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In 1945, we unleashed something like the world had never seen, and that is a pop gun compared to what can be done now,\" he noted during Berkshire's yearly gathering in 2016.\n\nBuffett also called nuclear weapons \"the ultimate problem of mankind\" in 2006. Moreover, the billionaire said in 2016 that if he could reduce the risk of a major nuclear, chemical, biological, or cyber attack by even 5%, he would commit all his wealth toward achieving that goal.\n\nThe Berkshire chief has also asserted that a US president's top priority should be combating those threats, and warned a major nuclear attack is one of the few things that could bankrupt his company.\n\nBuffett hasn't said whether he's going to see \"Barbie\" or \"Oppenheimer\" this weekend. Given he's drummed up demand for special-edition dolls, and banged the drum on nuclear threats, neither option seems out of the question."

    "text": "Nobody would have believed if they were told at the start of 2023 that Oppenheimer and Barbie would be two of the most anticipated movies in India. However, there is massive excitement among Indian viewers for Barbenheimer, both releasing on July 21.\n\nAdvance bookings for the opening day in the top three national chains alone exceeded all predictions, with around three lakh tickets sold for both movies combined, Pinkvilla reported.\n\nFor the opening day, Oppenheimer has managed to sell over two lakh tickets while Barbie followed closely behind with over 80 thousand tickets sold in the top three national chains, as per the publication. These numbers indicate a combined box office collection of anywhere between \u20b915 to 20 crores nett, primarily driven by audiences in metro cities, Pinkvilla added.\n\nRenowned screenwriter Paul Schrader earlier expressed his admiration for Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, likening it to his own iconic works such as \"Taxi Driver\" and \"Raging Bull.\" Calling it the \"most important film of this century,\" Schrader encouraged viewers to experience Oppenheimer's brilliance on the big screen.\n\nAcross the Pacific, Greta Gerwig's Barbie is projected to surpass Oppenheimer in the US box office race, boasting a star-studded cast featuring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. The film is expected to make a dazzling $110 million debut, with industry analysts even predicting it could reach as high as $140 million. Warner Bros, the distributor of \"Barbie,\" remains more cautious, anticipating a $75 million opening in the US market.\n\nInterestingly, while Barbie is dominating the US box office, Oppenheimer's appeal in India is soaring, probably due to Christopher Nolan's esteemed reputation as one of the finest filmmakers of his generation. At the same time, many have termed Oppenheimer as Nolan\u2019s best work till date.\n\nBarbie, on the other hand, comes from a director who has made outstanding films like Lady Bird and Little Women. In a wrapper of childlike presentation, she is delivering something that is more mature than it seems.\n\nMilestone Alert!Livemint tops charts as the fastest growing news website in the world \ud83c\udf0f Click here to know more."

    "text": "The incongruous duo of \u201cBarbie,\u201d a hot-pink comedic romp, and \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d a brooding period drama, combined to sell far more movie tickets than expected over the weekend, pushing the overall domestic box office to $311 million, according to Box Office Mojo, an online database. It was the biggest weekend haul in North America since 2019, and the fourth-largest ever, before adjusting for inflation.\n\nIt is a sign that Hollywood has, maybe, finally bounced back from the pandemic. (Whether the film business, which is dealing with dual writers\u2019 and actors\u2019 strikes, can keep the momentum going is another question.)\n\nThe weekend was also noteworthy for its variety, with \u201cBarbie\u201d collecting $162 million, \u201cOppenheimer\u201d $82.4 million and the rest of the features, including \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d and \u201cSound of Freedom,\u201d adding more than $66 million.\n\nTypically, the biggest weekends for domestic ticket sales have been dominated by a single blockbuster. During the highest grossing weekend, in April 2019, \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d accounted for nearly 90 percent of the box office. \u201cBarbie,\u201d by comparison, accounted for just over half of the box office over the weekend."

    "text": "The story tracks Oppenheimer \u2014 played with feverish intensity by Cillian Murphy \u2014 across decades, starting in the 1920s with him as a young adult and continuing until his hair grays. The film touches on personal and professional milestones, including his work on the bomb, the controversies that dogged him, the anti-Communist attacks that nearly ruined him, as well as the friendships and romances that helped sustain yet also troubled him. He has an affair with a political firebrand named Jean Tatlock (a vibrant Florence Pugh), and later weds a seductive boozer, Kitty Harrison (Emily Blunt, in a slow-building turn), who accompanies him to Los Alamos, where she gives birth to their second child.\n\nIt\u2019s a dense, event-filled story that Nolan \u2014 who\u2019s long embraced the plasticity of the film medium \u2014 has given a complex structure, which he parcels into revealing sections. Most are in lush color; others in high-contrast black and white. These sections are arranged in strands that wind together for a shape that brings to mind the double helix of DNA. To signal his conceit, he stamps the film with the words \u201cfission\u201d (a splitting into parts) and \u201cfusion\u201d (a merging of elements); Nolan being Nolan, he further complicates the film by recurrently kinking up the overarching chronology \u2014 it is a lot.\n\nIt also isn\u2019t a story that builds gradually; rather, Nolan abruptly tosses you into the whirl of Oppenheimer\u2019s life with vivid scenes of him during different periods. In rapid succession the watchful older Oppie (as his intimates call him) and his younger counterpart flicker onscreen before the story briefly lands in the 1920s, where he\u2019s an anguished student tormented by fiery, apocalyptic visions. He suffers; he also reads T.S. Eliot\u2019s \u201cThe Waste Land,\u201d drops a needle on Stravinsky\u2019s \u201cThe Rite of Spring\u201d and stands before a Picasso painting, defining works of an age in which physics folded space and time into space-time.\n\nThis fast pace and narrative fragmentation continue as Nolan fills in this Cubistic portrait, crosses and recrosses continents and ushers in armies of characters, including Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh), a physicist who played a role in the Manhattan Project. Nolan has loaded the movie with familiar faces \u2014 Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Gary Oldman \u2014 some distracting. It took me a while to accept the director Benny Safdie as Edward Teller, the theoretical physicist known as the \u201cfather of the hydrogen bomb,\u201d and I still don\u2019t know why Rami Malek shows up in a minor part other than he\u2019s yet another known commodity.\n\nAs Oppenheimer comes into focus so does the world. In 1920s Germany, he learns quantum physics; the next decade he\u2019s at Berkeley teaching, bouncing off other young geniuses and building a center for the study of quantum physics. Nolan makes the era\u2019s intellectual excitement palpable \u2014 Einstein published his theory of general relativity in 1915 \u2014 and, as you would expect, there\u2019s a great deal of scientific debate and chalkboards filled with mystifying calculations, most of which Nolan translates fairly comprehensibly. One of the film\u2019s pleasures is experiencing by proxy the kinetic excitement of intellectual discourse."

    "text": "It\u2019s billed as a biopic of theoretical physicist J Robert Oppenheimer, dubbed the \u201cfather of the atomic bomb\u201d. But \u201cbiopic\u201d seems too small a word to contain the ambition and scope of Christopher Nolan\u2019s formidable if occasionally unwieldy latest. Oppenheimer is a dense and intricate period piece, playing out in a tangle of timelines. It weaves together courtroom drama, romantic liaisons, laboratory epiphanies and lecture hall personality cults. But perhaps more than all of this, Oppenheimer is the ultimate monster movie. Cillian Murphy\u2019s Oppenheimer is an atomic-age Frankenstein, a man captivated by the boundless possibilities of science, realising too late that his creation has a limitless capacity for destruction. Ultimately, however, the monster in this story is not Oppenheimer\u2019s invention but the appetite for annihilation that it unleashes in mankind. It\u2019s a realisation that plays out, inexorably, in Oppenheimer\u2019s hollow, haunted face as the film unfolds. Murphy\u2019s far-seeing ice-chip eyes have never been put to better use.\n\nIn fact, Murphy\u2019s physicality as a whole is one of the most potent weapons at the film\u2019s disposal. He seems impossibly slight, a theoretical idea of a man in contrast to the robust certainties of the military figures he works alongside (Matt Damon\u2019s Lt Gen Leslie Groves, for example, is bullish and solid, a clenched fist looking for something to punch). In one shot we see Oppenheimer hauling an armful of books into a new classroom, and it looks as though he\u2019s buckling under the weight of his accumulated knowledge. At other times he\u2019s calm and glassily composed, somehow removed from jostling egos and the fusion of ideas that will take shape into the ultimate weapon.\n\nGiven Nolan\u2019s preference for shooting on Imax 70mm film, the picture has a depth of detail you could drown in\n\nThe version of Oppenheimer that we see on screen at any given time is a marker, an indication of which timeline we are currently inhabiting. Insights into his stellar early academic career are punctuated by glimpses of a later humiliating security clearance hearing that picked over every aspect of his life; the development of the bomb \u2013 the so-called Manhattan Project \u2013 is cut together with another hearing, this time in the Senate, to establish whether Oppenheimer\u2019s former colleague Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr, excellent) should be appointed in a federal government role. It\u2019s a knotty mesh of a structure. Time in Oppenheimer doesn\u2019t feel entirely linear \u2013 there are moments, in particular a pivotal encounter with Albert Einstein, that seem unmoored from the rest of the film. Nolan\u2019s films frequently require a couple of viewings to unravel fully, and while it lacks the baffle-factor of Tenet, Oppenheimer is no exception.\n\n\u2018A clenched fist looking for something to punch\u2019: Matt Damon, left, as Lt Gen Leslie Groves, with Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer. AP\n\nThere are other problems: the cursory treatment of the female characters is one. Florence Pugh, as Oppenheimer\u2019s mistress Jean Tatlock, gets short shrift. And Emily Blunt, as J Robert\u2019s wife Kitty Oppenheimer, spends much of the first two hours mutinously clutching a martini on the edge of the frame. She does, however, claim a couple of terrific moments later on: a skin-flaying interrogation scene; a wordless glare that conveys the full nuclear winter of her animosity towards a disloyal colleague.\n\nBut, for the most part, the film is a towering achievement. Not surprisingly, given Nolan\u2019s preference for shooting on Imax 70mm film, the picture has a depth of detail you could drown in. There\u2019s no shortage of scenes of furious blackboard scribbling, the accepted cinematic signifier of scientific genius. But more interesting are the abstract moments; it\u2019s as though we are venturing into the heart of the atom itself. Equally inventive is the way the sets seem to quake at moments of tension. Oppenheimer\u2019s world is literally rocked by the shockwaves of the reaction that has been set in motion.\n\nMost effective, however, is the use of sound and music. Like Jonathan Glazer\u2019s upcoming The Zone of Interest, this is a film in which the horrors of war are not shown but conveyed inescapably through what we hear. Ludwig G\u00f6ransson\u2019s score is masterful and mercurial, surely one of the finest of the year. And there\u2019s a recurring motif in the soundscape, a crescendo of thunderously stamping feet. It\u2019s taken from a moment of triumph and glory, the high point of Oppenheimer\u2019s career. But it takes on a mounting sense of threat with each use, as the catastrophic potential of the physicist\u2019s work becomes clear."

    "text": "It\u2019s a \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d world and we\u2019re just living in it.\n\nThe collective force of \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d continued to rule the box office in their second weekends of release, providing another needed jolt as two Hollywood strikes threaten the fragile exhibition industry.\n\nGreta Gerwig\u2019s cotton candy-colored fantasy comedy again led the way, adding a massive $93 million between Friday and Sunday. Ticket sales for \u201cBarbie\u201d declined just 43% from its debut and resulted in the seventh-biggest second weekend in history. The only movies that enjoyed bigger sophomore outings were billion-dollar behemoths \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d ($149 million), \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d ($147 million) and \u201cInfinity War\u201d ($114 million), \u201cBlack Panther\u201d ($111 million), \u201cJurassic World\u201d ($106 million) and \u201cThe Avengers\u201d ($103 million).\n\nChristopher Nolan\u2019s dark historical drama also had a stellar sophomore outing, taking in a mighty $46.6 million over the weekend. According to Universal, it became the first R-rated film to gross more than $10 million for 10 days in a row.\n\n\u201cWeekend two proves the outpouring of interest in \u2018Barbie\u2019 and \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 a week ago was not a fluke,\u201d says Paul Dergarabedian, a senior Comscore analyst. \u201cBoth films put up second weekend numbers that would have been considered solid as debuts and reflect two of the best sophomore session holds in box office history.\u201d\n\nAfter two weeks on the big screen, \u201cBarbie\u201d has generated $351.4 million in North America to stand as the fourth-biggest domestic release of the year. Globally, the Warner Bros. film has grossed $774 million and ranks as the third-largest film of 2023.\n\n\u201cOppenheimer,\u201d meanwhile, has earned $174 million at the domestic box office and $400 million at the global box office. It has already outperformed the lifetime grosses of two prior Nolan efforts, \u201cTenet\u201d ($365 million) and \u201cBatman Begins\u201d ($373 million).\n\nTwo new movies, Disney\u2019s remake of \u201cHaunted Mansion\u201d and A24\u2019s violent thriller \u201cTalk to Me,\u201d attempted to entice audiences in the wake of \u201cBarbenheimer,\u201d to varied results. (Of course, nobody could predict the dominant punch of the two blockbusters when release dates were set.)\n\n\u201cHaunted Mansion\u201d debuted in third place with $24.6 million from 3,700 North American theaters. The film added $9.1 million at the international box office, bringing its worldwide tally to $33 million. It\u2019s not a great result for a kid-centric tentpole and it probably didn\u2019t help that the Halloween-esque film opened in July. Disney spent $150 million to produce the film and tens of millions on promotional efforts. So, the film has a high bar to reach profitability, at least in its theatrical run.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t bode well that audiences were mixed on \u201cHaunted Mansion,\u201d which has a \u201cB+\u201d CinemaScore. Directed by Justin Simien and starring LaKeith Stanfield, Rosario Dawson, Tiffany Haddish and Owen Wilson, the film takes inspiration from the Disney theme park ride and follows a single mother and her son, who move into\u2026 a haunted mansion.\n\n\u201cDisney gets additional value from its productions for its other divisions \u2014 in this case, the film promotes its theme parks,\u201d says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. \u201cBut setting that aside, the movie has a long climb to break-even.\u201d\n\nThe low-budget \u201cTalk to Me\u201d generated a healthy $10 million from 2,340 theaters across the U.S. Those ticket sales exceeded expectations and were enough to land in sixth place. It\u2019s the second-biggest start in wide release ever for A24, following \u201cHereditary\u201d with $13.6 million.\n\n\u201cTalk to Me\u201d is the feature debut of Australian YouTube stars Danny and Michael Philippou. Reviews and word-of-mouth have been positive, which helped the film to break out at the box office. It centers on a group of friends who discovers how to conjure spirits, which is all fun and games until one of them unleashes a horrifying supernatural force.\n\n\u201cThis is an excellent opening for an indie horror picture made on a budget of $4.5 million,\u201d says Gross. \u201cThe horror genre continues to be a very creative space for new and developing talent.\u201d\n\nElsewhere at the domestic box office, the independent juggernaut \u201cSound of Freedom\u201d added $13.6 million from 3,411 theaters in its fifth weekend of release. The thriller about child sex trafficking has generated $150 million to date, making it the 12th-highest grossing domestic release of the year. Remarkably, \u201cSound of Freedom\u201d has earned more money in North America than big-budget tentpoles like \u201cFast X\u201d ($145 million), Pixar\u2019s \u201cElemental\u201d ($142 million) and Tom Cruise\u2019s \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d ($139 million).\n\n\u201cMission: Impossible\u201d took the No. 5 spot on domestic charts with $10.7 million from 3,191 venues in its third outing. Internationally, the film has generated $309.4 million for a global total of $448 million. Despite positive reviews, the $291 million-budgeted blockbuster has stumbled in the wake of \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d and will struggle to recover in its theatrical run.\n\nOverall, the month of July was ahead by 1.4% compared to pre-pandemic times, while the entire box office for the year remains down roughly 20%.\n\n\u201cJuly would have been a lukewarm month, but then \u2018Barbie\u2019 and \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 arrived; moviegoing exploded,\u201d says Gross. \u201cWithin one week, July caught up to its pre-pandemic average.\u201d"

    "text": "I'll admit I had my doubts when I first heard that director Christopher Nolan was planning to make a film about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who led the research effort to develop the first atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project. This is one of the most well-documented periods of 20th-century American history, after all, and there have already been so many books, films, and TV series about the race for the bomb, of varying quality. (As always, let me give a shout-out to Manhattan, a stellar fictional series that was tragically canceled after just two seasons.) How would Nolan make this very well-trodden material his own?\n\nI needn't have fretted. With Oppenheimer, Nolan has gifted us a truly unique, unflinching, nuanced portrait of the enigmatic, complicated man who spearheaded the Manhattan Project and subsequently ran afoul of the \"red-baiting\" politics of the McCarthy era. Technically it's a biopic, but it doesn't play like one. It's more like Nolan carefully selected various threads running through Oppenheimer's life and wove them into a richly textured tapestry that somehow transcends those raw materials. The result is pure visual poetry.\n\n(Spoilers below, although this is very well-documented history.)\n\nNolan's film is largely based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning 2005 biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin (which I highly recommend). The trailers understandably focused on the drama surrounding the birth of the atomic bomb leading up to the Trinity Test, but I had hoped that the film as a whole would follow the book's arc and include Oppenheimer's subsequent fall from grace. And so it does. In fact, that later, darker part of Oppenheimer's life provides the lens through which his earlier successes play out in Nolan's film.\n\nThere are two basic storylines, and the film shifts back and forth between them; Nolan has never been one to strictly adhere to a chronological timeline. \"Fission\" is shot in color and follows Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) through his early years as a graduate student and college professor; his leadership of the Manhattan Project culminating with the Trinity Test; his simultaneous triumph and torment in the wake of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; and the eventual loss of his security clearance thanks in large part to early Communist connections and his outspoken opposition to developing a hydrogen bomb.\n\n\"Fusion\" is shot in IMAX black-and-white analog photography and follows the 1959 Senate confirmation hearing of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), former chair of the Atomic Energy Commission who\u2014as the film gradually reveals\u2014played a critical role in stripping away Oppenheimer's security clearance five years earlier, angering many in the physics community. The black mark against Oppenheimer's name wasn't fully cleared until December 2022\u2014right around the time the first trailer for Oppenheimer appeared.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNolan has assembled an amazing cast. David Krumholtz is almost unrecognizable as I.I. Rabi, and Benny Safdie is perfection as Edward Teller, who sharply disagrees with Oppenheimer about the hydrogen bomb and eventually betrays him during the security hearings. Emily Blunt shines in a relatively small role as Kitty Oppenheimer, who suffered from depression and had a volatile relationship with her philandering husband, but remained fiercely loyal to him. (She really did refuse to shake Teller's hand when Oppenheimer was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award in 1963.) But the film ultimately belongs to Murphy and Downey Jr., both of whom give Oscar-worthy performances. Their mutual antagonism is arguably the heart of the film.\n\nPhysics fans should have fun picking out the various physics luminaries who make brief cameos. Jack Quaid's Richard Feynman has few lines but is recognizable due to his bongos\u2014an anachronism, since Feynman didn't take up the bongos until later in life, but an entertaining anachronism. Hey, there's Werner Heisenberg (Matthias Schweigh\u00f6fer), Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh), Leo Szilard (M\u00e1t\u00e9 Haumann), Enrico Fermi (Danny Deferrari), Luis Alvarez (Alex Wolff), Hans Bethe (Gustaf Skarsg\u00e5rd), Vannevar Bush (Matthew Moline), Kenneth Bainbridge (Josh Peck), and the infamous Klaus Fuchs (Christopher Denham).\n\nNolan brings an impressive degree of historical accuracy to the film without resorting to a slavish recitation of facts, seeding it with oodles of throwaway details and characters as ornamental flourishes. For instance, the truth about whether a young Oppenheimer really injected cyanide into an apple intended for one of his professors (future Nobel Prize winning physicist Patrick Blackett) is hotly debated by historians, but it was not invented for the film. I was pleased to see mention of the paper Oppenheimer co-authored with a student while at Berkeley in 1939 predicting black holes\u2014a topic largely forgotten until John Wheeler's work in the 1960s. Even his signature cocktail gets a shout-out.\n\nOppenheimer's mistress, Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), did commit suicide, and there is an assassination conspiracy theory that she was murdered and her suicide staged\u2014something barely hinted at in the film, but present nonetheless. There was a certain amount of online shock at the nudity and sex scenes between Murphy and Pugh, but I thought they were carefully handled and weren't remotely gratuitous\u2014especially the touching post-coital scene where the pair are simply sitting naked, having an intensely intimate conversation.\n\nPresident Truman did call Oppenheimer a \"crybaby\" (albeit not to his face) when the latter met with him after the war and confessed he felt he had blood on his hands. It's also true that Oppenheimer never publicly expressed regret for his role in building a bomb that killed between 100,000 and 200,000 people. (The exact number is still a matter of debate.) As he says in the film, his thinking was that it would be better to make dropping the first nuclear weapon so horrifying that nobody would ever want to use them again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dialogue during the openly hostile interrogation of Oppenheimer at the security hearings was drawn almost verbatim from the official transcripts\u2014delivered to dramatic perfection by Nolan's outstanding cast. One of the most powerful scenes is the (verbatim) testimony of physicist David Hill (Rami Malek) during Strauss' Senate confirmation hearing to be Eisenhower's Secretary of Commerce.\n\nStrauss had hoped Hill, then chair of the Federation of American Scientists, would speak in his favor. Instead, Hill declared that \"most of the scientists in this country would prefer to see Mr. Strauss completely out of the Government,\" and went on to provide a devastating critique of Strauss, citing his arrogance, lack of integrity, and personal vindictiveness toward Oppenheimer in particular. (Nolan dug up the transcript himself from Senate records.) Strauss was not confirmed\u2014the first failure of a Cabinet nomination since 1925\u2014and the rejection effectively ended his political career. He remained bitter about that for the rest of his life. Some might call it karma.\n\nThat said, this is not a documentary, and naturally a few liberties were taken. Most notably, the powerful final conversation between Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), referencing a conversation they'd had in the past, is entirely fictional. Nor is the actual physics front and center, since thematically, Nolan is far more interested in exploring questions of power, politics, patriotism, and personal internal paradoxes. Still, the film handily captures the world of physics and physicists. Case in point: in one scene, Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) questions Oppenheimer about the possible risk of igniting the atmosphere and destroying the world when they push the detonator button for the Trinity Test. \"Chances are near zero,\" Oppie responds. \"What do you want from theory alone?\" Groves responds, \"Zero would be nice.\"\n\nThose less familiar with this period in history might not pick up on all the ornamental details, but that shouldn't hamper their enjoyment of the film. Ars Senior Technology Editor Lee Hutchinson had quibbles with the sound quality, however, citing \"mumbling, background noise obscuring the dialog, and putting VFX behind dialog so the sound overpowered everything else.\" That wasn't the case at the screening I attended (or at least, I didn't notice). Still, forewarned is forearmed, and there was also criticism about the sound mixing for Nolan's 2020 film, Tenet. Audiophiles, take note.\n\nClocking in at three hours' running time, with many scenes featuring a bunch of white men sitting around talking about physics and defense strategy, Oppenheimer is the antithesis of what is usually deemed summer fare. Yet Nolan's skill in telling the story is such that it never seems to drag. Small wonder audiences have been flocking to theaters to see the film. (Many made it a double feature with Barbie, hence the \"Barbenheimer\" phenomenon.) Oppenheimer greatly exceeded its initial box office projections and has already grossed over $400 million worldwide. It's my pick for best film of 2023 thus far, and a worthy addition to my growing list of films about the atomic bomb.\n\nOppenheimer is now playing in theaters."

    "text": "Films about Great Men are usually acts of hagiography, and in many ways, Oppenheimer is no different. Christopher Nolan\u2019s biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer, \u201cthe father of the atomic bomb\u201d, is invested in Oppenheimer as a once-in-a-generation genius, a Great Man who literally moved the earth, but Nolan is also interested in all of Oppenheimer\u2019s failures and foibles. And I do mean ALL of them, at a monster 180 minutes, Oppenheimer wades through the tides of Oppenheimer\u2019s life if not at a leisurely pace, then certainly at a thorough one. We learn that \u201cOppy\u201d is brilliant at theoretical physics but bad at math and a liability in the lab, he\u2019s a womanizer, a bad dad and worse husband, and a big enough believer in his own importance to underestimate his own political liabilities.\n\nCillian Murphy plays Oppenheimer with a bright-eyed intensity and steely fortitude in turns, as he portrays the man from his student days in Europe to his post-war downfall. Nolan divides his film into three sections, one centered on a post-war hearing to renew, or not, Oppenheimer\u2019s government security clearance; another focused on his days heading the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, New Mexico; and the final section, told in black and white, from the perspective of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.) during his own senate confirmation hearing to join Eisenhower\u2019s cabinet.\n\nOppenheimer is a big film, not just in minutes but in scope of story and scale of ambition. It covers decades and monumental moments in history, but also makes room for more personal moments, such as Oppenheimer\u2019s disastrous affair with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), a gifted but troubled psychiatrist and Communist activist. Nolan, working from Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin\u2019s epic biography, American Prometheus, is interested in the contrast of Oppenheimer the Great Man and Oppenheimer the Lousy Asshole, though there is enough sympathy for Oppenheimer the Guy Who Changed His Mind Later that even Oppenheimer\u2019s worst traits are a little rose-colored.\n\nWhich parts of Oppenheimer appeal the most is entirely personal. I responded most to the later portion of the film focused on Lewis Strauss\u2019s confirmation hearing. Oppenheimer isn\u2019t even in this portion of the film, he only appears in black and white flashbacks as Strauss recalls their fraught history to a young senate aide (Alden Ehrenreich, absolutely stealing the show). Strauss personally recruited Oppenheimer to Princeton University, but after seeing Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) in conversation, and then being ignored by Einstein, he takes a strong dislike to Oppenheimer, believing the other man turned Einstein against him.\n\nNolan, one of the most exacting filmmakers working today, recreates Los Alamos in painstaking detail (with production design by Ruth De Jong and set decoration by Claire Kaufman, Olivia Peebles, and Adam Willis), and re-stages the Trinity Test\u2014minus the nuclear material\u2014to its fullest effect. It is terrible, it is monstrous, it is awesome in the Biblical sense of the word\u2014it is not more horrifying than even one single image of the real devastation visited upon Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nThe Manhattan Project portion of the film offers a lot of interesting stuff, from the recreated Trinity Test to Oppenheimer\u2019s hideous home life\u2014set to a soundtrack of screaming babies and his wife\u2019s functional alcoholism\u2014to Matt Damon\u2019s reliably charming performance as the Army general tasked with keeping all these half-Commie scientists in line during the war. There is also a lot of time devoted to Oppenheimer sowing the seeds of his own destruction, as he dabbles in left-wing politics\u2014mostly harmless before the war, but utterly devastating during the Red Scare that comes after. As smart as he is, Oppenheimer truly cannot read the room, whether it\u2019s attending socialist rallies at the wrong moment or inadvertently betraying a friend as a possible spy.\n\nBut this portion of the film is also the most rote biopic stuff in Oppenheimer. It\u2019s very well crafted and extremely well-acted, and it\u2019s not exactly boring, it\u2019s just that it doesn\u2019t top a single line delivered during the \u201csenate hearing\u201d portion of the film. Oppenheimer\u2019s security clearance hearing at least has a truly great scene with Emily Blunt as Kitty, Oppenheimer\u2019s long-suffering wife, a talented scientist in her own right relegated to the kitchen by The Times. That scene crackles with Kitty\u2019s repressed fury\u2014at her husband, at the men undermining him, at the world undermining her\u2014and comes closest to the stellar line from the senate hearing.\n\nThat line, though, it just overshadows everything, even the big bomb drop. \u201cDid you ever stop to think,\u201d the disillusioned aide says to Strauss, \u201cthat they didn\u2019t talk about you at all? That they had more important things to talk about?\u201d A lesser actor than Alden Ehrenreich would make a meal out of that line, but he delivers it with devastating casualness, as if it\u2019s so obvious a thought it isn\u2019t even worth the breath it takes to utter it. In truth, no one knows what Oppenheimer and Einstein talked about that day at Princeton, but Lewis Strauss built his reality around the idea that it was him. How silly of him! How asinine!\n\nAt its best, Oppenheimer is not a Great Man biopic, it\u2019s not a technical marvel of filmmaking, it\u2019s not a cracking thriller about the race to end World War II, and it\u2019s definitely not a meditation on the consequences of using nuclear weapons. At its best, Oppenheimer is a story about small, petty men changing the world for the worse because they cannot fathom that THEY are not the center of it. It\u2019s a cautionary tale less about nuclear power and more about the deleterious effect of self-important men on those around them. Oppenheimer dismisses Einstein as the best mind of his generation, past his prime and no longer on the cutting edge, but Einstein is, in fact, old enough to know that it\u2019s not about him, a lesson literally no other man in this film learns until it\u2019s too late.\n\nOppenheimer is good enough, and long enough, that everyone will have a different favorite part, though I suspect what will linger longest is not the history lesson, or the cinematic gee-whizzery, but the look on Strauss\u2019s face when someone points out that maybe he wasn\u2019t the main character all along. Sometimes, a person comes along and can change the world as J. Robert Oppenheimer did, ushering in the nuclear age. But always there are those men like Lewis Strauss, manipulating people and events to satisfy their vindicative agendas made up of imagined slights. We only have to cope with a transformative genius like Oppenheimer occasionally\u2014and sometimes they even improve the world, with art and music and beauty\u2014but we always have to navigate the detritus of the aggrieved egos of men like Strauss. Oppenheimer is about genius, about a man, about a bomb, but it\u2019s also about the waste laid to the world by weak men.\n\nThis review was published during the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes of 2023. The work being reviewed would not exist without the labor of writers and actors. Oppenheimer is exclusively in theaters from July 21, 2023.\n\nAttached - Matt Damon arriving at JFK with his family after wrapping Oppenheimer promotion due to the strike."

    "text": "UPDATED: It\u2019s still a Barbie world this weekend as the Greta Gerwig-directed charmer reached a global cume of $1.184B. Last session, Margot Robbie\u2019s living doll crossed the $1B threshold, and in this 4th frame added $45.1M in 75 offshore markets (a 47% dip) to bring the international box office cume to $657.6M.\n\nOverall, this was mostly a holdover weekend offshore for the studios with the only major new release being Sony\u2019s Gran Turismo: Based on a True Story in a staggered pattern. Local China pic No More Bets also upped the ante in that market while India saw a handful of new releases propel it to a record-breaking weekend \u2013 see more below.\n\nTurning back to Warner Bros\u2019 Barbie, as we\u2019ve reported, it is the highest-grossing live-action movie from a female director worldwide. It is also WB\u2019s 2nd biggest film ever, overtaking Aquaman globally.\n\nInternationally, Barbie has entered the Top 10 list of WB\u2019s biggest movies ever at No. 8 and surpassing The Dark Knight Rises. It\u2019s the No. 1 U.S. movie of the year in 25 markets including Italy, the UK, Poland, Brazil and Australia; and the biggest WB title ever in 21, including the UK (where it has crossed $100M to overtake Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2), Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina and Poland.\n\nThe UAE opened this weekend with $1.9M for Barbie\u2019s 5th best score of the session. The result is 71% above Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, 41% over Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 and higher than Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania by 34%.\n\nSaudi Arabia had a strong opening at at No. 1 with $1.8M, ahead of Indy 5 by 262%, Guardians 3 by 161%, Quantumania by 117%, Avatar: The Way of Water by 37% and Jurassic World Dominion by 33%.\n\nJapan\u2019s opening was $1.4M on 650 screens with scores from Eiga and Filmarks at 3.5 and 3.8 out of 5, respectively. Results are roughly on par with Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again and Sex and the City.\n\nThe Top 5 Barbie markets to date are the UK $101.1M, Mexico ($51.8M), Australia ($47.3M), Germany ($42.2M) and Brazil ($42M).\n\nClose on Barbie\u2019s heels and also from Warner Bros, Meg 2: The Trench in its sophomore session grossed another $43.7M in 75 offshore markets. That lifts international to $202.8M with the worldwide running total now at $256.9M.\n\nIn China, where China Media Capital releases, the big shark pic has reached $90.2M, landing in 3rd place this weekend amid strong competition. Maoyan is projecting a $123M finish for the co-production.\n\nBehind China, Mexico ($15M), UK ($9.7M), France ($7.6M) and Spain ($7.4M) round out the Top 5. Korea opens on Tuesday followed by Japan on August 25.\n\nUniversal and Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer saw a 43% drop in its fourth weekend with another $32M from 79 markets. The international box office cume is now $384.8M as it sits at $649M through Sunday.\n\nThe overseas cume to date is above The Dark Knight Rises and more than double Dunkirk, Interstellar, Inception and Tenet at the same point of release.\n\nThis is now Nolan\u2019s biggest film of all time in 50 markets including Germany, Brazil, Netherlands India and Poland. It\u2019s his top non-superhero movie in a total 62.\n\nVietnam was new this session with a $443K debut, above Tenet, The Dark Knight Rises and more than double Dunkirk excluding previews. By Saturday, it had already surpassed the lifetime of Interstellar and delivered the biggest opening Friday and Saturday for a Nolan film, and the highest IMAX Friday and Saturday share of all time.\n\nAlso notable, in the UK the Cillian Murphy-led drama overtook Star Wars: The Last Jedi on Friday to become the 3rd biggest IMAX release of all time. And, in Brazil, Oppenheimer topped the lifetime of The Dark Knight Rises.\n\nThe global IMAX cume is $134M including $58.7M from offshore screens \u2013 the 4th biggest title ever in the format in like-for-like markets. In 11 markets, it\u2019s the best IMAX performance ever including Mexico and India.\n\nThe Top 5 overall markets are the UK ($58.1M), Germany ($35.4M), France ($28M), Australia ($21M) and India ($17.7M).\n\nKorea opens this Tuesday which is a holiday, followed by Italy and China later in August.\n\nMeanwhile, Paramount\u2019s Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One has topped $500M globally with $522.5M through Sunday. This weekend, Tom Cruise drew another $10.9M worth of business in 67 overseas markets, down 39% from last session, for a running offshore total of $362.9M.\n\nThe 4th weekend in Japan had a fantastic hold as the Obon holiday kicked off and saw the actioner jump 25% versus last week, ranking No. 1. The cume there is $26.6M.\n\nChina is still the biggest overall market with $48.2M, followed by the UK and Korea, both at $31.2M, Japan ($26.6M) and France ($21.9M).\n\nSony\u2019s Gran Turismo: Based on a True Story got off the starting block overseas ahead of domestic (where the pic is previewing before its official August 25 release), revving the engines to $10.7M from 30 markets. Majors in the first suite include France, the UK, Australia, Germany and Spain. France led all play at $2.3M, followed by the UK ($1.3M) and $1M a piece for Australia and Germany and $900K in Spain.\n\nSony got things going on the PlayStation game adaptation from director Neill Blomkamp at Cannes in May, taking over the Carlton pier\u2019s billboard and hosting a photo call towards the end of the fest. Stars David Harbour and Orlando Bloom had earlier shown off a first look during CinemaCon in April.\n\nIt\u2019s early days, but the hope here is that word of mouth drives performance. The movie is currently carrying a 57% from critics on Rotten Tomatoes but is much higher with audiences at 97%. In Germany, exits are at 4.5 stars while France\u2019s AlloCin\u00e9 has it at a 2.5 from critics but 4.2 from audiences.\n\nKey markets still to come are Brazil and Mexico on August 24, followed by China on September 1, Japan on September 15 and Italy and Korea on September 20.\n\nParamount\u2019s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem in its sophomore frame added $10.4M from 47 markets. Internationally, the heroes on the half-shell have grossed $21.9M to date for $94.7M global with several major markets still to release.\n\nNew this session, Mexico debuted at No. 2 with $2.9M, followed by France at $1.8M. In China, the start was a No. 8 $885K amid strong local competition. The UK leads play with $7.2M.\n\nDisney/Pixar\u2019s Elemental fired up a 42% drop from last session overseas. After nine weekends in play, the international total is $293.4M for $443.6M global. This weekend added $8.9M from 51 markets. There was a 6% bump in Japan where the gross is now $7.2M.\n\nKorea is still tops at $50.4M, followed by Mexico ($20.5M), France ($19.9M), the UK ($19.6M) and China ($15.9M).\n\nIn China, Super Lion\u2019s crime drama No More Bets from director Ao Shen has grossed RMB 1.76B+ ($244M) on its way to a Maoyan projected finish of RMB 3.7B ($511M). The weekend was approximately RMB 720M ($99.5M) in first place. In IMAX, it grossed $6M locally. Maoyan\u2019s Creation of the Gods: Kingdom of Storms also continues to perform, now having reached RMB 2.01B ($278M), including $28M from IMAX in China.\n\nLed by Rajinikanth-starrer Jailer and Anil Sharma\u2019s Gadar 2, India\u2018s August 11-13 frame was the busiest single weekend since the beginning of the pandemic and set a new all-time theatrical gross record for the biggest combined weekend in history at more than 390 crore ($47M).\n\nIn Korea, new opener Concrete Utopia got off to a strong start with $11.4M while crime pic Smugglers is now at an outstanding $31.6M.\n\nMISC UPDATED CUMES/NOTABLE\n\nHaunted Mansion (DIS): $3M intl weekend (45 markets); $22.7M intl cume/$75.6M global\n\nTransformers: Rise of the Beasts (PAR): $1.6M intl weekend (25 markets); $279.6M intl cume/$436.7M global\n\nInsidious: The Red Door (SNY): $1M intl weekend (58 markets); $104.2M intl cume/$185.8M global\n\nAsteroid City (UNI): $726K intl weekend (46 markets); $20.4M intl cume/$48.3M global"

    "text": "More than 200,000 people sat for nearly five hours with nothing but the artificial light of the screen casting shadows over their awed faces this past weekend as the cultural phenomenon \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d swept the nation.\n\nPart of what drove the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d double-feature craze is the hyper feminine-masculine dichotomy between the films, as \u201cBarbie\u201d was advertised as a feminist paradise while viewers assumed \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d a biopic about the man who led the creation of the atomic bomb, would tackle war and corruption. Ahead of the films\u2019 opening, online consensus favored watching \u201cOppenheimer\u201d first then ending the day with \u201cBarbie\u201d under the assumption that the former would be incredibly depressing and audiences would need an uplifting only the latter could provide. But in true GW fashion, this Barbie decided to be a devil\u2019s advocate and watched director Greta Gerwig\u2019s masterpiece first.\n\nIn \u201cBarbie,\u201d viewers are quickly introduced to Margot Robbie\u2019s Stereotypical Barbie as she makes the rounds in Barbieland, a matriarchal utopia, from an all-Barbie Supreme Court and a Pink House for the president, while the Kens \u2026 are sort of in charge of the beach. After a long day of observing physicist Barbie win a Nobel Prize (score one for the Barbies over J. Robert Oppenheimer) and moderating a fight between Ryan Gosling\u2019s needy Stereotypical Ken and Simu Liu\u2019s Lifeguard Ken, she brings a choreographed, blowout dance party to a halt, asking: \u201cDo you guys ever think about dying?\u201d\n\nThe literal record-scratch moment sparks the plot of the film as the next day Barbie\u2019s fantasy world crumbles, sending her to seek sage advice from Kate McKinnon\u2019s Weird Barbie. She discovers the girl playing with her in the Real World is negatively influencing her life and journeys to heal her human counterpart.\n\nIn a desperate attempt for her affection, Gosling\u2019s Ken tags along for the ride. Barbie and Ken get separated through their misadventures, giving Ken the opportunity to discover patriarchy and import it back to Barbieland, creating a host of problems that the Barbies must solve. Along the way, Barbie teams up with mother-daughter pair Gloria and Sasha, the humans responsible for her existential crisis.\n\nAfter initially hearing about this film, many people wrote it off as fluff to promote Mattel\u2019s brand. Instead, \u201cBarbie\u201d unexpectedly goes where many blockbusters before it haven\u2019t, by catering to a predominantly female audience through its satirizing of the patriarchy and gender dynamics. From the hard cut showing an ad for Depression Barbie, a doll that wears sweatpants all day and rewatches the BBC\u2019s \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d show until she passes out, to the Barbies experiencing the canon event of pretending to enjoy a man playing guitar, the comedy was meant for the girls.\n\nThe peppy acting of the ensemble cast, featuring stars from Issa Rae to Michael Cera, is true to the dolls they portray. Yet Robbie still delivers a heartfelt performance alongside her creator, Ruth Handler, in which Barbie unpacks an identity crisis while Ruth, played by Rhea Perlman, praises her for evolving. The film resolves with an ending that is beyond \u201cKenough\u201d but you\u2019ll have to see for yourself.\n\nChristopher Nolan\u2019s adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography \u201cAmerican Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,\u201d chronicles the father of the atomic bomb\u2019s conflicted morals and personal woes as he worked on the Manhattan Project, and pinpoints his career\u2019s downfall through two government hearings. An early scene in which Oppenheimer, played by Cillian Murphy, attempts to poison his teacher, goes through a crisis of conscience, and then thwarts the professor from dying foreshadows a shocking amount of the film.\n\nPolitics and quantum physics go hand in hand as Oppenheimer initially struggles to get security clearance due to his ties to members of the Communist Party. Few actors encapsulate pain and regret like Murphy as he stares off into space during a Red Scare-sparked hearing into his communist associations, which unfortunately eats up valuable time in the film as the hearings are endless.\n\nThe race to build the weapon of mass destruction leads Oppenheimer to assemble a team of renowned scientists and convene them for three years in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Though I failed my AP Physics exam, I found the scenes in which Oppenheimer debates with his fellow scientists how to construct the bomb to be among the most engaging in the movie \u2014 in part because of the bizarre ensemble of actors Nolan assembled. During the infamous Trinity test, none other than Josh Peck \u2014 yes, a man who once ran over Oprah in a Nickelodeon show \u2014 turns the key that unleashes a bomb.\n\nBut Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt, who were limited in screen time likely because of the unnecessarily extensive time Nolan devoted to the hearings, still shined. Pugh in the role of Jean Tatlock, Oppenheimer\u2019s ex-flame, captures an intense torturedness in her vulnerable interactions with him, especially when he reveals to her his engagement. Blunt, who plays Oppenheimer\u2019s wife Kitty, expertly shifts from quiet despair after being made aware of his affair to firecracker as she defends him during a security hearing.\n\nAll of that said, no movie should be three hours long. In an effort to stay true to history, Nolan drilled too deep into the legal and national security implications of Oppenheimer\u2019s loss of clearance, misplacing the actual plot: Oppenheimer\u2019s late-arriving conscience and subsequent moral crisis. In an effort to build tension, the complex governmental hearings just dragged on as Nolan brought back too many acquaintances and enemies of Oppenheimer to make their cases.\n\nAfter participating in this fever dream of head-to-toe pink outfits and a frenzy of film bros, I can confidently say seeing these films back to back is a mistake. Some might argue that I just watched them in the wrong order but \u201cBarbie\u201d genuinely was not all party, more a meditation on girl and womanhood, and in truth, no movie or TV show can overpower \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d Believe me, I tried watching \u201cGlee\u201d afterward.\n\nThese films each deserve a full day and a clear mind to be appreciated, from the fantastic floor-to-ceiling plastic sets of \u201cBarbie\u201d to the multi-layered, fraught emotions of \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d"

    "text": "Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer.\n\nA disturbing detail in Oppenheimer seems to hint at a larger conspiracy... and it sees director Christopher Nolan in true \"horror mode.\"\n\nDuring a harrowing sequence of quick shots, the death of Jean Tatlock is shown as she seemingly drowns herself in the bath. However, a pair of black-gloved hands hints that all is not as it seems.\n\n\u201cOne thing in Oppenheimer I haven't been able to get out of my head is that brief insert of black gloves in that one flashback with Florence Pugh,\u201d said film fan Josh Lewis on Twitter. \u201cNolan was really in his horror mode.\u201d\n\nOne thing in Oppenheimer I haven't been able to get out of my head is that brief insert of black gloves in that one flashback with Florence Pugh. Nolan was really in his horror mode. \u2014 Josh Lewis (@thejoshl) July 23, 2023\n\nHe\u2019s not the first to notice the gloved hands, and the scene seems to suggest that Tatlock\u2019s death wasn\u2019t suicide at all. Tatlock is played by Florence Pugh and features throughout the movie as Oppenheimer\u2019s lover who continued to have a relationship with the scientist while he was married to his wife, Kitty (played by Emily Blunt).\n\nNot only frowned upon due to the illicit nature of their relationship, Tatlock was also a keen member of the Communist party and was seen by many to be a security risk. Tatlock\u2019s fate is teased throughout the film, with a flashback eventually revealing she supposedly drowned herself in the bathtub.\n\nOf course, the gloved hands suggest otherwise, and fans have since been debating its meaning. Some believe the scene is a manifestation of Oppenheimer\u2019s guilt and the gloved hands are meant to represent Oppenheimer blaming himself for her death.\n\nThe horrifying blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment is the closest Nolan comes to horror in Oppenheimer. However, it also teases a decades-old conspiracy. Following her death, an autopsy determined her cause of death as death by drowning, however, a \u201cfaint trace\u201d of chloral hydrate was found in her system, a substance capable of sedating a person.\n\nAccording to the book American Prometheus, on which Oppenheimer is based, at least one physician had doubts about her cause of death, speculating she may have been drugged and forcibly drowned. \u201cIf you were clever and wanted to kill someone, this is the way to do it,\u201d said one doctor.\n\nThis subsequently led to speculation by historians, as well as Tatlock\u2019s own brother, that she may have been killed by U.S. Government officials due to her affiliation to the Communist party, coupled with her closeness to one of the Manhattan Project\u2019s key players.\n\n\u201cI do not believe that her interests were really political,\u201d Oppenheimer told The United States Atomic Energy Commission in 1954. \u201cShe was a person of deep religious feeling. She loved this country, its people, and its life.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, it looks as though Oppenheimer director Christopher Nolan may have been convinced enough to tease that her death wasn\u2019t a suicide at all.\n\nIGN\u2019s Oppenheimer review gave it 10/10 and said: \u201cA biopic in constant free fall, Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan\u2019s most abstract yet most exacting work, with themes of guilt writ large through apocalyptic IMAX nightmares that grow both more enormous and more intimate as time ticks on. A disturbing, mesmerizing vision of what humanity is capable of bringing upon itself, both through its innovation, and through its capacity to justify any atrocity.\u201d\n\nWant to read more about Oppenheimer?

    "text": "The area of southern New Mexico where the Trinity test occurred was not, contrary to the popular account, an uninhabited, desolate expanse of land. There were more than 13,000 New Mexicans living within a 50-mile radius. Many of those children, women and men were not warned before or after the test. Eyewitnesses have told me they believed they were experiencing the end of the world. They didn\u2019t reflect on the Bhagavad Gita, as Oppenheimer said he did. Many simply dropped to their knees and recited the Hail Mary in Spanish.\n\nFor days after, they said, ash fell from the sky, contaminated with 10 pounds of plutonium. A 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that after the test, radiation levels near some homes in the area reached \u201calmost 10,000 times what is currently allowed in public areas.\u201d\n\nThat fallout has had devastating health consequences. While I know of no people who lost their lives during the test, the organization I co-founded has documented many instances of families in New Mexico with four and five generations of cancers since the bomb was detonated. My family is typical: I am the fourth generation in my family to have had cancer since 1945. My 23-year-old niece has just been diagnosed with thyroid cancer. She is a college student studying art. Now her life, too, has been upended.\n\nDespite this, New Mexicans who may have been exposed to radioactive fallout from Trinity have never been eligible for compensation under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a 1990 federal law that has provided billions of dollars to people exposed during subsequent tests on U.S. soil or during uranium mining.\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d leaves out other stories, too. The Manhattan Project and the nuclear weapons industry used the promise of a better life to entice thousands of people in the Southwest into the uranium mines that supplied the Manhattan Project. The miners went to work each day without adequate safety gear, while supervisors wore it from head to toe. Miners seldom left the mines during their shifts, even to eat lunch. They drank the contaminated water inside the mines when they were allowed to take breaks."

    "text": "For two years of my time as a student at the University of Chicago, my dorm building, my cafeteria, and the library where I worked all stood on the same block as the site of the world's first-ever manmade nuclear reactor.\n\nUpon first glance, you wouldn't really know just how much this stretch of land in Chicago's Hyde Park shaped the Atomic Age. Between the hustle and bustle of students, you might be more distracted by the crayon-bright colors of the Max Palevsky dorms, the imposing brutalist architecture of the Regenstein Library, or even the glass dome of the Mansueto Library. Look past those, however, and you'll see a bronze statue by Henry Moore, titled \"Nuclear Energy,\" commemorating the construction of the reactor \u2014 and the moment in 1942 when it went critical.\n\nThat same nuclear reactor makes an ever-so-brief appearance in Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, when physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) journeys to Chicago to check out his Manhattan Project colleagues' progress. He encounters physicists like Enrico Fermi (Danny Deferrari) and Leo Szilard (M\u00e1t\u00e9 Haumann), who confirm that they have successfully engineered the first manmade nuclear reaction. How did they do it? With Chicago Pile-1, or CP-1: a reactor made of bricks of graphite, built under a football field on an active college campus.\n\nThe scene barely takes up any time in the three-hour-long epic that is Oppenheimer, but the science behind it is crucial to the creation of the atomic bomb. Not only that, but the construction of CP-1 is fascinating enough that it could easily be its own movie. How did it work? Did it leave any radiation on the UChicago campus? And perhaps most strangely of all, why was it built under a football field?\n\nWhat is CP-1, and why was it important to the Manhattan Project?\n\nA painting of Enrico Fermi and his colleagues overseeing construction of Chicago Pile-1. Credit: Fotosearch/Getty Images\n\nAs the Manhattan Project got underway, several things became apparent. First, scientists had to determine whether controlling a nuclear chain reaction was even possible.\n\nThe principle of a chain reaction was already well understood by this point. \"If very heavy nuclei \u2014 in this case uranium \u2014 absorb a neutron, they will fission, and they will break into pieces and give up a certain amount of energy so that the nuclei fly off and everything gets hotter,\" Peter Littlewood, Chair of the UChicago Department of Physics, explained to Mashable in a phone interview. \"For every nucleus that fissures, you generate three extra neutrons. And if these neutrons get captured by another, then you get nine and you keep on building. That's what we call a chain reaction.\"\n\nOn top of figuring out how to control such a reaction, the scientists also needed enough fissile material, such as plutonium or uranium, to place in the test bomb, as well as the bombs that the U.S. government would go on to drop over Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nEnter CP-1. In November of 1942, Fermi and other members of the UChicago's Metallurgical Laboratory \u2014 which studied plutonium \u2014 constructed CP-1 on a squash court under the west football stands of the University's Stagg Field. Stagg was once host to UChicago's football team. However, Fermi and colleagues didn't have to worry about interfering with football games or practice given that University President Robert Maynard Hutchins had ended the fairly dominant varsity football program in 1939.\n\n\"I think it is a good thing for the country to have one important university discontinue football,\" Hutchins told students in a 1940 address. \"There is no doubt that, on the whole, the game has been a major handicap to education in the United States.\" (The sport returned in 1969, although by then, the old Stagg Field had been replaced by the Regenstein Library.)\n\nThanks to UChicago's sudden aversion to athletics, construction on CP-1 continued until December 2, 1942, when the reactor produced the first manmade, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. With the knowledge that such a a reaction was possible, construction began on a nuclear reactor in Hanford, Washington, where plutonium production for the Trinity Test bomb and the bomb dropped over Nagasaki took place. CP-1 itself was not responsible for any of the plutonium production.\n\n\"CP-1 was designed as an experiment. It wasn't designed to do anything other than prove that the principle worked,\" Peter Littlewood, Chair of the UChicago Department of Physics, told Mashable in a phone interview. \"But they were so confident that it worked that they had already designed the Hanford reactor before the experiment was completed.\" Construction on Hanford only took 18 months.\n\nHow did CP-1 work?\n\nCP-1, according to \"Oppenheimer.\" Credit: Screenshot: Universal Pictures\n\nFermi himself described CP-1 as \"a crude pile of black bricks and wooden timbers.\" So how did such a \"crude\" structure, 20 feet wide and 25 feet tall, create a monumental chain reaction?\n\nOn top of the graphite blocks, CP-1 also contained smaller pellets of uranium, which would help initiate the chain reaction in the first place. The graphite served as a \"moderator\" for the reaction. \"It slows down neutrons and makes them more easy to absorb by uranium atoms,\" Littlewood explained in an e-mail.\n\nBut the ultimate form of control came in the form of long wooden rods coated in cadmium, which absorbed the neutrons. \"When the control rods are all pushed in, nothing happens,\" said Littlewood. \"Then you withdraw the control rods, and every time you do that, there's a little burst of energy.\" Fermi and his team monitored these bursts of energy, watching the power build up and calculating how far to pull the control rods out until the energy was self-sustaining.\n\nWere the CP-1 experiments safe?\n\nLet's take a field trip to a nuclear reactor...under a football field. Credit: Screenshot: Universal Pictures\n\nUpon learning that I was spending a large chunk of my time at UChicago hanging out around the site of an old nuclear reactor, I was mildly alarmed. Would I graduate from school with an extra head?\n\nOn the one hand, every tour group passing the Moore statue gets assured that the site is not a radioactive hazard. On the other hand, an old professor of mine once told my class a rumor that the caf\u00e9 in the Regenstein Library had been moved from the basement to the first floor due to traces of radiation found in the basement. (To put it in perspective: I and many other UChicago students have spent more time in that library basement than Cillian Murphy does staring right into the camera in Oppenheimer.)\n\nLuckily, Littlewood assured me that that wasn't the case. \"I have heard that rumor, but not really from a reputable source, so I don't buy it.\"\n\nHe continued: \"The other thing is that radiation is everywhere, and it's very easy to find. Could there have been some radioactive contamination that was permanent? It would depend on how well they cleaned up the fissile material or what they did with it. At the time, and certainly later in the Cold War, we were extraordinarily lax in taking care of radioactive material... But the amount of radiation which was created by CP-1 would probably have been quite tiny.\" Graphite could also have absorbed some of the radiation, acting as protection in a setting that otherwise lacked shielding.\n\nAdding to these assurances? In a 2019 NPR story, UChicago's radiation safety officer James Marsicek used a Geiger counter to measure the radiation around what used to be Stagg Field. The counter consistently measured .02 millirems per hour, simply picking up the background radiation that naturally occurs around us.\n\nNone of this is information that you'll get in Oppenheimer \u2014 a film already filled to the brim with decades' worth of science \u2014 but it's crucial to understand just how much effort went into the Manhattan Project. One quick glimpse of CP-1 in the movie hides stories of abandoned football fields, hastily constructed power plants, and even worries (now soothed) about radioactive libraries. But Littlewood is quick to point out that CP-1's role in the Manhattan Project is only part of its impact.\n\nWhen CP-1 went critical, Littlewood said that \"it became clear, at that point, that you could use nuclear power to generate energy. Following the war, there was work from the government to do that. That involved setting up what became Argonne National Lab, which is about 25 miles southwest of the city. Argonne National Lab was the place which designed and built the first set of nuclear reactors and formed the prototypes of things which have spread around the world. So it's very much a case of swords into plowshares.\"\n\nAs for the UChicago Physics Department's thoughts on Oppenheimer? \"We're physicists, so we're not used to getting excited,\" Littlewood said. \"I'm sure we'll probably do a private screening of it at some point for our students.\n\nOppenheimer is now in theaters."

And they're not gratuitous. They're perfect. And Florence is just amazing,\" Murphy said of Pugh in an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, published July 19.\n\n\"She has this presence as a person and on screen that is staggering. The impact she has for the size of the role, it's quite devastating,\" Murphy said.\n\nA-list marketing\n\nWhile gushy media tours aren't new \u2014 \"A Star is Born,\" anyone? \u2014 this one stands out first because of the sheer quantity of comments and the competition it's up against.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI'm talking, of course, about the marketing behemoth that is Greta Gerwig's \"Barbie.\" \"Barbie\" has been widely promoted with everything from Barbie-themed Xbox controllers to burgers numbering among the movie's many wall-to-wall marketing plays.\n\nIn fact, \"Barbie\" had a $150 million marketing budget, per Variety. That's bigger than the estimated $100 million it cost to make \"Oppenheimer.\"\n\nWith competition like that, \"Oppenheimer\" needed to muster every ounce of marketing magic it had. Having the very famous and talented cast publicly declare their admiration for one another is a low-cost but effective way to promote \"Oppenheimer.\"\n\nAnd it looks like it's working. According to Deadline, the movie clocked the highest global day and date opening weekend ever for a biopic. \"Oppenheimer\" also bested \"John Wick: Chapter 4\" by netting the biggest opening weekend for an R-rated film in 2023, per Screen Rant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNolan may just want to reunite this cast for his next cinematic masterpiece."

More about that in a moment.\n\nIt was christened the Manhattan Project by someone else with some New York connections, Colonel Leslie Groves (Matt Damon in \u201cOppenheimer\u201d). But where he came from and where he had been educated had nothing to do with it. (He had been born in Albany \u2014 although he grew up on one Army post after another, as the family trailed his military-chaplain father \u2014 and graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point.)\n\n\u201cIt was Groves who decided that the first location of this project would be Manhattan \u2014 \u2018We\u2019ll park it there for the time being,\u2019\u201d said Robert Norris, a historian of the atomic age and the author of \u201cThe Manhattan Project\u201d (2007).\n\nThe first headquarters were in an office building across from City Hall Park in Lower Manhattan where the Corps of Engineers already had an outpost. Other important Manhattan Project work was done by scientists who were given space in the offices of a front company in the Woolworth Building, at 233 Broadway.\n\nOne name that was suggested for the new, supersecret effort was a mouthful that Groves worried would get noticed \u2014 Laboratory for the Development of Substitute Materials. Groves opted for plain vanilla, calling it the Manhattan Engineer District as \u201ca way to make it sound normal,\u201d Norris said. \u201cNo one would be suspicious of what was going on.\u201d"

    "text": "This image released by Universal Pictures shows Jason Clarke is Roger Robb in a scene from \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d (Melinda Sue Gordon/Universal Pictures via AP) Movie Review: A bomb and its fallout in Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Movie Review: A bomb and its fallout in Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019\n\nChristopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is a kinetic thing of dark, imposing beauty that quakes with the disquieting tremors of a forever rupture in the course of human history.\n\n\u201cOppenheimer,\u201d a feverish three-hour immersion in the life of Manhattan Project mastermind J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), is poised between the shock and aftershock of the terrible revelation, as one character calls it, of a divine power.\n\nThere are times in Nolan\u2019s latest opus that flames fill the frame and visions of subatomic particles flitter across the screen \u2014 montages of Oppenheimer\u2019s own churning visions. But for all the immensity of \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d this is Nolan\u2019s most human-scaled film \u2014 and one of his greatest achievements.\n\nIt\u2019s told principally in close-ups, which, even in the towering detail of IMAX 70mm, can\u2019t resolve the vast paradoxes of Oppenheimer. He was said to be a magnetic man with piercing blue eyes (Murphy has those in spades) who became the father of the atomic bomb but, in speaking against nuclear proliferation and the hydrogen bomb, emerged as America\u2019s postwar conscience.\n\nNolan, writing his own adaptation of Martin J. Sherwin and Kai Bird\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning 2005 book \u201cAmerican Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,\u201d layers the build-up to the Manhattan Project with two moments from years later.\n\nIn 1954, a probing inquiry into Oppenheimer\u2019s leftist politics by a McCarthy-era Atomic Energy Commission stripped him of his security clearance. This provides the frame of \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d along with a Senate confirmation hearing for Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), who chaired the Atomic Energy Commission and was a stealthy nemesis to Oppenheimer.\n\nThe grubby, political machinations of these hearings \u2014 the Strauss section is captured in black and white \u2014 act like a stark X-ray of Oppenheimer\u2019s life. It\u2019s an often brutal, unfair interrogation that weighs Oppenheimer\u2019s decisions and accomplishment, inevitably, in moral terms. \u201cWho\u2019d want to justify their whole life?\u201d someone wonders. For the maker of the world\u2019s most lethal weapon, it\u2019s an especially complicated question.\n\nThese separate timelines give \u201cOppenheimer\u201d \u2014 dimly lit and shadowy even in the desert \u2014 a noirish quality (Nolan has said all his films are ultimately noirs) in reckoning with a physicist who spent the first half of his life in headlong pursuit of a new science and the second half wrestling with the consequences of his colossal, world-altering invention.\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d moves too fast to come to any neat conclusions. Nolan, as if reaching to match the electron, dives into the story at a blistering pace. From start to finish, \u201cOppenheimer\u201d buzzes with a heady frequency, tracking Oppenheimer as a promising student in the then-unfolding field of quantum mechanics. \u201cCan you hear the music, Robert?\u201d asks the elder Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh). He can, absolutely, but that doesn\u2019t mean finding harmony.\n\nNolan, whose last film was the time-traveling, palindrome-rich \u201cTenet,\u201d may be the only filmmaker for whom delving into quantum mechanics could be considered a step down in complexity. But \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is less interested in equations than the chemistry of an expanding mind. Oppenheimer reads \u201cThe Waste Land\u201d and looks at modernist painting. He dabbles in the communist thinking of the day. (His mistress, Jean Tatlock, played arrestingly, tragically by Florence Pugh, is a party member.) But he aligns with no single cause. \u201cI like a little wiggle room,\u201d says Oppenheimer.\n\nFor a filmmaker synonymous with grand architectures \u2014 psychologies mapped onto subconscious worlds (\u201cInception\u201d) and cosmic reaches ( \u201cInterstellar\u201d ) \u2014 \u201cOppenheimer\u201d resides more simply in its subject\u2019s fertile imagination and anguished psyche. (The script was written in first person.) Nolan and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema render Oppenheimer\u2019s interiority with flashes of images that stretch across the heavens. His brilliance comes from his limitlessness of thought.\n\nJust how much \u201cwiggle room\u201d Oppenheimer is permitted, though, becomes a more acute point when war breaks out and he\u2019s tasked by Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr. (Matt Damon) to lead the race to beat the Nazis to an atomic bomb. The rapid building of Los Alamos on the white-sand mesas of New Mexico \u2014 a site chosen by and with personal meaning to Oppenheimer \u2014 might not be so different than the erecting of movie sets for Nolan\u2019s massive films, which likewise tend to culminate with a spectacular explosion.\n\nThere is something inherently queasy about a big-screen spectacle dramatizing the creation \u2014 justified or not \u2014 of a weapon of mass destruction. Oppenheimer once called the atomic bomb \u201ca weapon for aggressors\u201d wherein \u201cthe elements of surprise and terror are as intrinsic to it as are the fissionable nuclei.\u201d Surely a less imperial, leviathan filmmaker than Nolan \u2014 a British director making an American epic \u2014 might have approached the subject differently.\n\nBut the responsibility of power has long been one of Nolan\u2019s chief subjects (think of the all-powerful surveillance machine of \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d). And \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is consumed with not the just the ethical quandary of the Manhattan Project but every ethical quandary that Oppenheimer encounters. Big or small, they could all lead to valor or damnation. What makes \u201cOppenheimer\u201d so unnerving is how indistinguishable one is from the other.\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d sticks almost entirely to its protagonist\u2019s point of view yet also populates its three-hour film with an incredibly array of faces, all in exquisite detail. Some of the best are Benny Safdie as the hydrogen bomb designer Edward Teller; Jason Clarke as gruff special counsel Roger Robb; Gary Oldman as President Harry Truman; Alden Ehrenreich as an aide to Strauss; Macon Blair as Oppenheimer\u2019s attorney; and Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer, the physicist\u2019s wife.\n\nThe greatest of all of them, though, is Murphy. The actor, a Nolan regular, has always been able to communicate something more disturbing underneath his angular, angelic features. But here, his Oppenheimer is a fascinating coil of contradictions: determined and aloof, present and far-away, brilliant but blind.\n\nDread hangs over him, and over the film, with the inevitable. The future, post-Hiroshima, is sounded most by the wail of children who will grow up in that world; the Oppenheimers\u2019 babies do nothing but cry.\n\nWhen the Trinity test comes at Los Alamos after the toil of some 4,000 people and the expense of $2 billion, there\u2019s a palpable, shuddering sense of history changing inexorably. How Nolan captures these sequences \u2014 the quiet before the sound of the explosion; the disquieting, thunderous, flag-waving applause that greets Oppenheimer after \u2014 are masterful, unforgettable fusions of sound and image, horror and awe.\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d has much more to go. Government encroaches on science, with plenty of lessons for today\u2019s threats of annihilation. Downey, in his best performance in years, strides toward the center of the film. You could say the film gets bogged down here, relegating a global story to a drab backroom hearing, preferring to vindicate Oppenheimer\u2019s legacy rather than wrestle with harder questions of fallout. But \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is never not balanced, uncomfortably, with wonder at what humans are capable of, and fear that we don\u2019t know what to do with it.\n\n\u201cOppenheimer,\u201d a Universal Pictures release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for some sexuality, nudity and language. Running time: 180 minutes. Four stars out of four.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP"

    "text": "Director Christopher Nolan is well known for avoiding computer generated effects in his films when possible, preferring instead to capture all the action in-camera. But Nolan's penchant for doing things the old-fashioned way goes beyond what moviegoers see on screen.\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter this week, Nolan revealed that his \"kids would probably say I'm a complete Luddite\" because of how tech-averse he is in his working life.\n\nThe \"Tenet\" director, who in 2020 told People that he uses a flip phone over a smartphone, said that he chooses to not get too \"involved\" with technology so as to maintain focus.\n\n\"It's about the level of distraction,\" Nolan said. \"If I'm generating my material and writing my own scripts, being on a smartphone all day wouldn't be very useful for me.\"\n\nBack in 2020, he described himself as \"easily distractible.\"\n\n\"I don't really want to have access to the internet every time when I'm bored,\" he said at the time. \"I do a lot of my best thinking in those kind of in-between moments that people now fill with online activity, so it benefits me.\"\n\nBut his old-school ways don't stop there. The computer that the 52-year-old writes his scripts on isn't connected to the internet, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nNolan also prefers to hand deliver his scripts to actors rather than sending them digitally. While he said this has given him a reputation for working \"in secrecy,\" Nolan said the truth is anything but.\n\n\"It's not secrecy, it's privacy,\" he said. \"It's being able to try things, to make mistakes, to be as adventurous as possible. And to be able to sit with somebody who's just read what you've written and get their take on it, see how they connect with it in a very human, face-to-face way.\"\n\nDating back to his 2000 breakout hit \"Memento,\" Nolan has written every one of his films save for 2002's \"Insomnia.\" His latest movie, the hotly anticipated \"Oppenheimer,\" will hit theaters on July 21.\n\nDON'T MISS: Want to be smarter and more successful with your money, work & life?

Although his movie will be battling \u201cBarbie\u201d at the box office, Nolan recently told IGN that \u201cit\u2019s terrific\u201d to have both summer tentpoles open on the same day.\n\n\u201cSummer, in a healthy marketplace, is always crowded, and we\u2019ve been doing this a long time,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cI think for those of us who care about movies, we\u2019ve been really waiting to have a crowded marketplace again, and now it\u2019s here and that\u2019s terrific.\u201d\n\nCillian Murphy, who stars in the title role of \u201cOppenehimer,\u201d agreed with Nolan, telling IGN: \u201cI think it\u2019s great.

AMC Theatres reported on July 10 that over 20,000 members of its AMC Stubs program have purchased tickets to see both \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d on the same day.\n\n\u201cThat more than 20,000 moviegoers have already made plans and purchased tickets to see \u2018Barbie\u2019 and \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 on the same day is a great sign that the growing online conversation around seeing both of these incredible films is turning into ticket sales,\u201d said Elizabeth Frank, executive VP of worldwide programming and chief content officer at AMC Theatres.\n\n\u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d open in theaters July 21 from Warner Bros. and Universal Pictures, respectively."

    "text": "Oppenheimer stars Matt Damon and Cillian Murphy know the routine with director Christopher Nolan, having worked with him on previous movies: Nolan makes a call, they meet, the actor reads the script while Nolan waits nearby.\n\nWhat Robert Downey Jr. didn't know is that those scripts are presented in a low-tech manner, which ended up being the Iron Man actor's one complaint about working with the filmmaker.\n\nChristopher Nolan at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival; Robert Downey Jr. at the 2023 U.K. premiere of 'Oppenheimer'. Emma McIntyre/Getty Images; Joe Maher/WireImage\n\n\"I went over to his house. I read it,\" explains Downey in EW's Around the Table with Nolan and the cast. \"I don't want to complain, but it's on red paper printed in black, which is kind of difficult at best.\"\n\n\"And a bit unnerving as well,\" interjects Emily Blunt, who plays Oppenheimer's wife Kitty in the film.\n\n\"I guess there's something about it that makes it that you forget it as soon as you read it,\" jokes Downey, who portrays Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss in Oppenheimer. \"I don't know what those colors are. Anyway, it's a thing. You read the script, it's written in the first person, you're transported, and it's a journey to read it, and then at the end of that, the guy who wrote the script you just read is asking you if you want to do it. It's kind of like being hypnotized.\"\n\nRobert Downey Jr. in 'Oppenheimer'. Melinda Sue Gordon/Universal Pictures\n\nAs it turns out, the red paper doesn't have any hypnotic powers at all \u2014 the color just makes it difficult to photocopy the pages.\n\nBlunt, who is also a Nolan-movie first-timer, admits that she didn't realize she was actually being offered a role when she first met with the director.\n\n\"I went and met Chris in L.A., and I didn't know the process \u2014 I didn't know if you were meeting countless other people,\" she says. \"So we talked for an hour or so, and then he's just very casual, and he goes, 'So it's the part of his wife and I'd love you to take a look at it.' And you're like, is this an offer? [Laughs] So I went into the living room and read the script and it was just so heart-racing. It was so awesome.\"\n\nEmily Blunt in 'Oppenheimer'. Universal Pictures\n\nBlunt reveals that she called Murphy, who has appeared in a slew of Nolan-directed movies, to ask what she could expect from the experience of working with the filmmaker.\n\n\"I knew Cillian from A Quiet Place II, so, of course, I called him and I said, 'What's it like? Come on, tell me,\" recalls the actress. \"And he just said, 'You're going to just love it. You're going to love it. It's so focused, there's no chaos, it's very giving, it's collaborative,' and [he said] how amazing he was with actors. I think that is the great beauty of Chris. There are directors who are led by the visuals, or there are directors who are pretty good with actors, but you never find where someone is as mirroredly brilliant at both. So I was excited about the focus of it, I was excited about the screws getting tightened on everybody, and what that atmosphere will feel like on a film set.\"\n\nOppenheimer drops in theaters July 21.\n\nSee Nolan and his cast reveal more about the making of Oppenheimer in the full Around the Table video below.\n\nEW's Around the Table interview was conducted prior to the start of the SAG-AFTRA strike.\n\nWant more movie news?

    "text": "As far back as Batman Begins in 2005, Christopher Nolan has been making films rated in the PG-13 bracket, or 12A in the UK. That changes with Oppenheimer. The biopic of the \u2018father of the atomic bomb\u2019 marks Nolan\u2019s first R-rated (or 15 certificate) film since Insomnia in 2002.\n\nThe BBFC states that Oppenheimer\u2019s 15 certificate is due to \"strong language, sex\", but there are other aspects of the film that ensure it\u2019s not exactly all-ages viewing, from alcoholism to all-consuming guilt, to the general threat of nuclear annihilation.\n\nOn the latest episode of the Inside Total Film podcast, Nolan addresses Oppenheimer\u2019s R-rating. Asked if he knew from the outset that Oppenheimer would necessitate that certification, he says, \u201cYeah, definitely.\u201d\n\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy) is an extremely complex and contradictory figure. He\u2019s a scientific genius, lover of the arts, and has an almost savant-level facility with languages. But he\u2019s also a dilettante, a womaniser, and unstable, to list a few of the adjectives thrown at him.\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u2019s sexuality \u2013 who he was as a person, and how that expressed itself \u2013 is a very, very important part to understanding both what motivated him and what pushed him, how he thought,\u201d continues Nolan. \u201cBut also the obsessions that ultimately had tremendous consequence in his later life for him, and, by proxy, frankly, for the entire world.\n\n\"It was very important to tell his story in a fully realised way. And so, when I brought the project to the studio, they knew the length it was going to be [Oppenheimer has a running time of three hours], and they knew it was going to be R-rated. I was very clear about that.\n\n\u201cIt was something we definitely anticipated. We\u2019re just dealing with a very serious and complex subject. I didn\u2019t want to have to shy away from any aspect of it.\u201d\n\n(Image credit: Universal)\n\nAnd asked if he sees Oppenheimer as a bleak film, Nolan says: \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting analogy for me with Dunkirk. When I was making Dunkirk, I knew, as a British person, the freighted emotion of that story, of that sort of national story that we have, that you grow up with. It\u2019s so extreme, that what I decided to do in the telling of it was to really play against that, and have relatively anonymous characters in not specifically emotional situations, to make an objectively intense film, trusting that the emotion of the story is so great [inherently] that it would actually be sort of, in a way, magnified by that.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve done something in a similar vein with Oppenheimer in that the darkness of the story is so inherent in just what the atomic bomb is, and what it\u2019s meant for the world. We\u2019re really pushing against that in the film, and trying to find the suspense, the fun, the excitement, the incredible relationships\u2026 I think the underlying darkness is undeniable. By the end, it overwhelms the film. It\u2019s hard to explain that mechanism exactly. But it feels appropriate. It feels like what the story should always be.\u201d\n\nOppenheimer opens in cinemas on 21 July. For more from Nolan and star Cillian Murphy, plus Greta Gerwig on Barbie, listen to the latest episode of the Inside Total Film podcast. You can also read more from our interviews with Nolan, as well as actors Emily Blunt and Matt Damon, online.\n\nIn the meantime, check out our guide to the rest of the most exciting upcoming movies in 2023 and beyond."

The podcast episode aired on Thursday.\n\n\"You look at what that did and where that went with everything. I think that was Jon just knowing what an incredible actor, what an incredible potential that was from Downey,\" Nolan told interviewer and entertainment journalist Josh Horowitz, who runs the podcast.\n\nThe actor is credited with turning Marvel Studios into a cinematic powerhouse with his portrayal of Tony Stark, Iron Man's alter-ego. Downey Jr. made multiple appearances as Stark between 2008 and 2019, including the \"Iron Man\" trilogy and all four \"Avengers\" films.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDowney Jr. himself has questioned the impact of spending so much time in a single role. In an interview published this month, the actor told The New York Times he was worried that playing Iron Man for so long was going to affect his acting skills.\n\n\"You start to wonder if a muscle you have hasn't atrophied,\" Downey Jr. told The Times.\n\nBut Nolan's comments in the Happy Sad Confused podcast indicate the director has a different take on Downey Jr.'s acting prowess.\n\n\"It's really cool to see somebody who's achieved so much greatness as a movie star, then pivot completely and stretch themselves in a way that a lot of people haven't seen him do,\" Nolan, who directed Downey Jr. in his latest film \"Oppenheimer,\" said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepresentatives for Nolan and Downey Jr. did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Insider sent outside regular business hours."

    "text": "Josh Hartnett revealed to Playboy magazine in 2015 that he talked with Christopher Nolan about taking on the role of the Caped Crusader in the director\u2019s \u201cBatman Begins,\u201d which launched Warner Bros.\u2019 billion-dollar grossing \u201cDark Knight\u201d trilogy. How far did those talks go before Nolan settled on Christian Bale instead? In a new interview on the \u201cHappy Sad Confused\u201d podcast, Nolan confirmed talks with Hartnett took place, but his casting never got too serious.\n\n\u201cNo, it never got that far,\u201d Nolan said when asked if he screen-tested Hartnett for the role of Batman.\n\n\u201cI met with Josh and if I recall, he was a young actor whose work I was very interested in,\u201d Nolan added. \u201cI had an initial conversation with him but he had read my brother\u2019s script for \u2018The Prestige\u2019 at the time and was more interested in getting involved with that. So it never went further than that.\u201d\n\nHartnett was not cast in \u201cBatman Begins,\u201d nor was he cast in \u201cThe Prestige.\u201d Both films starred Bale. Hartnett would have to wait over a decade to get his chance to work with Nolan, which he did in the upcoming \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d Hartnett plays Ernest Lawrence, a nuclear physicist and the inventor of the cyclotron who becomes J. Robert Oppenheimer\u2019s close friend at the University of California, Berkley.\n\nHartnett isn\u2019t the only \u201cOppenheimer\u201d actor with ties to Nolan\u2019s Batman. In a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, Nolan confirmed his \u201cOppenheimer\u201d lead Cillian Murphy screen tested for the role of Batman. Both men knew Murphy was not right for the part, but Nolan wanted Murphy to screen test in front of studio executives so they could see his acting chops.\n\n\u201cEverybody was so excited by watching you perform that when I then said to them, \u2018Okay, Christian Bale is Batman, but what about Cillian to play Scarecrow?\u2019 There was no dissent,\u201d Nolan remembered. \u201cAll the previous Batman villains had been played by huge movie stars: Jack Nicholson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jim Carrey, that kind of thing. That was a big leap for them and it really was purely on the basis of that test. So that\u2019s how you got to play Scarecrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d opens in theaters July 21 from Universal Pictures. Watch Nolan\u2019s latest appearance on the \u201cHappy Sad Confused\u201d podcast below."

    "text": "NEW YORK \u2013 Like most savvy actors, Matt Damon always picks up the phone for Christopher Nolan.\n\nThe A-lister, who previously appeared in Nolan\u2019s 2014 film \u201cInterstellar,\u201d was planning to take a break from acting when the Oscar-nominated director called about \u201cOppenheimer\u201d (in theaters Friday), his chilling new historical drama.\n\n\u201cI had told my wife I was taking time off,\u201d says Damon, speaking to USA TODAY in a joint interview with co-star Emily Blunt before the Screen Actors Guild strike. \u201cThis was something we literally negotiated, but the one caveat was \u2018if Chris Nolan calls.\u2019 He was my get-back-to-work card, and then he actually called, which was a wonderful surprise.\u201d\n\n'Oppenheimer':Christopher Nolan made his new movie because he thought he'd die in a nuclear Armageddon\n\nMatt Damon brings levity to the 'wildly unpopular' Leslie Groves\n\nIn the white-knuckle epic, Damon plays gruff U.S. Army officer Leslie Groves, who calls on physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) to oversee the creation of the atomic bomb during World War II. Groves was \u201cwildly unpopular\u201d with the scientists, Damon says, and frequently butted heads with Oppenheimer. But there was still \u201cmutual respect\u201d between the two men.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re complete polar opposites,\u201d says Damon, sitting at a hotel in New York's Tribeca neighborhood. \u201cThe military is obsessed with secrecy, and the scientists are trying to get to the root of the problem, which they do by sharing. Groves constantly felt like a kindergarten teacher chasing these guys around. So Chris found some comedy there, which is good for a movie about something so serious.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe that\u2019s why he cast you,\u201d Blunt suggests. \u201cEveryone loves you and you have a natural warmth. If you cast someone unlikable playing someone unlikable, it would\u2019ve been (alienating).\u201d\n\nEmily Blunt's Kitty Oppenheimer is 'volatile' yet fiercely loyal\n\nBlunt portrays Kitty, Oppenheimer\u2019s caustic, alcoholic wife. When Oppenheimer is probed by government officials about possible Communist ties, she demands that he stop feeling sorry for himself. She\u2019s similarly unsympathetic about the death of his former lover.\n\n\u201cKitty didn\u2019t do small talk. She only did big talk,\u201d Blunt says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot about her that wouldn\u2019t necessarily be \u2018likable,\u2019 but I don\u2019t think she cared. She was such a force of personality.\u201d Toward the end of the film, \u201cshe\u2019s become so volatile and unpredictable \u2013 the drinking is out of control. But he says to his defense (team), \u2018Kitty and I have walked through fire together, and I believe in her.\u2019 She\u2019ll fight for him when he won\u2019t fight for himself.\u201d\n\nThe movie's Trinity test scene was 'beautiful' yet 'nightmarish' to behold\n\nOne of the movie\u2019s most thrilling sequences is the Trinity test, when the first nuclear weapon was detonated in the New Mexico desert in 1945. The bomb\u2019s mushroom cloud and blinding light were recreated using practical effects.\n\n\u201cBecause the explosion is real, it\u2019s as beautiful as it is nightmarish,\u201d Blunt says. \u201cBecause you know it\u2019s not (computer-generated), you can\u2019t dissociate from it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take your eyes off it, but it\u2019s the most terrible thing you\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Damon adds. Witnessing it on the set, \u201cit was a big boom. Everybody had their earplugs in.\u201d\n\n'Barbenheimer':How a movie meme inspired the 'crazy, weird' double feature\n\nEmily Blunt recalls her 'Devil Wears Prada' moment with director Christopher Nolan\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d is the second film Blunt, 40, and Damon, 52, have made together, including the 2011 sci-fi thriller \u201cThe Adjustment Bureau.\u201d Blunt says they would \u201chang out constantly\u201d while shooting the latter, going on double dates with her husband, John Krasinski, and Damon\u2019s wife, Luciana Barroso.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re vacation buddies and neighbors,\u201d says Blunt, who lives in the same Brooklyn apartment building as Damon. \u201cI know, it\u2019s ridiculous. This is strange not to see Matt in his sweats and slippers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only time I wear shoes is when we do interviews together,\u201d Damon quips. \u201cI\u2019ve got a great pair of house slippers, and I\u2019m going to put them right on when I get home. I did accidentally wear my Ugg slippers on a school run once.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know who hates Uggs more than anyone?\u201d Blunt asks. \u201cChristopher Nolan. I\u2019ve never known anyone to detest a pair of Uggs more than Chris Nolan. It\u2019s a testament to how he wants everything on set to look as it would (in the period). If there\u2019s a plastic bottle in the shot, he\u2019s like, \u2018Ugh!\u2019 He hates to even look at it. I would sometimes put on some Uggs and I\u2019d just get this withering look down to my feet \u2013 it was like being in \u2018The Devil Wears Prada\u2019 again. Just the look down to the shoes. And I'd go, 'I know, I know. But I'm just sitting on an apple box in the background today!' \"\n\nAs a joke, Blunt gave Nolan a pair of Uggs at the end of the shoot. His wife, Emma Thomas, \u201cwrote to me and was like, \u2018Brilliant wrap gift. He\u2019s wearing them now,\u2019 \" Blunt recalls with a laugh. \u201cI was so pleased!\u201d"

We meet the director in LA to talk about going nuclear.\n\nRead an extract of our exclusive Oppenheimer feature from our July 2023 issue below, or see the full piece here.\n\nWe see the lower fifth of Christopher Nolan. The shoes. A bit of trouser. A small section of Christopher Nolan on the move, glimpsed through the bottom of a windowed wall, the rest blocked out by frosted glass, obscuring him until he\u2019s ready.\n\nHe stops to talk to someone, but even then, despite hearing his voice, we can\u2019t make out the words. So here we sit, waiting for him in a small conference room, seeing and hearing bits of him, unable to piece it all together. It\u2019s enigmatic. It\u2019s cryptic. It\u2019s \u2014 dare we say \u2014 cinematic. And very Christopher Nolan. He just can\u2019t help himself.\n\nYes, for a man who likes his films to pose questions rather than provide answers, who constructs them like puzzles, this all makes sense. It\u2019s early May in the Los Angeles post-production facility where his films are taken to the finish line. In rooms and offices there is evidence of an impressive career \u2014 framed newspaper cuttings about The Prestige, various awards, an Inception poster, a Batpod maquette, framed cells from the Dark Night trilogy, and film cans containing reels from his latest opus, Oppenheimer, a bit of which he\u2019s just played for Empire in a screening room so loud it felt like an earthquake. As it should \u2014 this is a film about the man responsible for the development of the atomic bomb. The footage is, we tell Nolan as he finally appears, unnerving. \u201cI think \u2018unnerving\u2019 is definitely a good word to describe it!\u201d he laughs."

    "text": "Christopher Nolan's \"The Dark Knight\" debuted in theaters on July 18, 2008.\n\nThe film pits Christian Bale's Batman against Heath Ledger's Joker.\n\nIt's seen as one of the best superhero movies ever made, and it would still work without the costumes.\n\nNEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business \u2014 delivered daily.

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's not exactly controversial to say that Christopher Nolan's \"The Dark Knight\" is one of the best superhero movies ever made. It frequently tops \"best of\" lists, with many critics praising the battle between Christian Bale's bat-brained vigilante and Heath Ledger's chaotic Joker.\n\nBut at its heart, \"The Dark Knight\" isn't a superhero movie, not really. It's a crime thriller with a few outlandish outfits. After all, the story hinges on political corruption in the mayor's office and in the Gotham City Police Department, which allows the mob to move its dirty money around the city and into off-shore accounts.\n\nIt's a far cry from a typical superhero \"magic orb\" plot, where a costumed crusader has to stop a bad guy from getting a specific object in order to save the universe \u2014 sorry Marvel, but it's been done to death.\n\nHeath Ledger as the Joker. Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nIf you took Bruce Wayne's military-grade weapons and body armor bat suit away from him, the story would pretty much work the same. It would still be about a man determined to root out injustice and corruption from his city, while also grappling with a domestic terrorist who revels in chaos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHeath Ledger's Joker is one of the purest and most blood-chilling villains because he isn't weighed down by a tragic, complicated origin story. He simply wages a psychological war of terror on Gotham in an attempt to make the city destroy itself. His methods and motivations are chaos.\n\nThat lack of justification makes the Joker all the more terrifying \u2014 no colorful costume and decrepit face paint needed.\n\nNolan's grounded approach makes things far more fascinating than the typical CGI battles audiences are used to. One of the most powerful (and intimidating) scenes of the film is Batman trying to interrogate the Joker at the GCPD.\n\nLedger and Bale give truly dedicated performances that pull the audience to the edge of their seats. It's a masterclass in tension.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBatman will stop at nothing to save people, dishing out brutality as an interrogation technique, whereas the Joker simply can't be bargained with \u2014 and he enjoys the power that gives him over people. It's the type of script we don't see as often in the superhero genre anymore.\n\nUnfortunately, in the 15 years since its release, studios seem to have taken the wrong cues from Nolan's Batman trilogy \u2014 not everything needs to be injected with gritty realism. Instead, filmmakers should ask themselves if their films, like Nolan's, can stand on their own without the high-octane stunts, overcomplicated multiverses, and silly capes."

    "text": "Apple TV+'s Foundation bucks a recent trend in how sci-fi television shows are made. Rather than building a virtual soundstage, often called a \"Volume,\" to create digital backdrops for actors to play against, or even resorting to tried and true green screen filming, Foundation films many scenes on location across multiple countries. ComicBook.com spoke to David S. Goyer during the Foundation Season 2 press junket and asked why he has taken Foundation's production in that direction. Goyer told us that part of it is his nature, and part of is a filmmaking philosophy influenced by working with Christopher Nolan on projects like The Dark Knight Trilogy.\n\n\"Well, number one, I'm just a contrarian,\" Goyer says. \"If the bulk of the people are going this way, just by my nature I'll go in the other direction. We don't use a Volume or anything like that on our show, I would say at least half the show we film location, on remote locations. Part of that is just my filmmaking philosophy. I did a lot of shows with Chris Nolan. That's his philosophy and he likes to do as much as possible in camera.\"\n\nHe continues, \"I just believe that nothing can replace that sense of reality that grittiness to actually being there, whether it's the light, whether it's the grit in the air when we're in the Canary Islands, whether it's the cold in Iceland. I love the natural beauty and I think that we've always filmed in multiple countries because so much of our show takes place in different worlds and I just think that's what sets our show apart from so many of these other shows that are made largely in a virtual environment. I'm completely committed to making the show that way. It's more difficult but I think the results speak for themselves.\"\n\nWhat is Foundation Season 2 about? How to watch:\n\nAccording to the official synopsis for Foundation Season 2, \"More than a century after the season one finale, tension mounts throughout the galaxy in Foundation season two. As the Cleons unravel, a vengeful queen plots to destroy Empire from within. Hari, Gaal and Salvor discover a colony of Mentalics with psionic abilities that threaten to alter psychohistory itself. The Foundation has entered its religious phase, promulgating the Church of Seldon throughout the Outer Reach and inciting the Second Crisis: war with Empire. The monumental adaptation of Foundation chronicles the stories of four crucial individuals transcending space and time as they overcome deadly crises, shifting loyalties, and complicated relationships that will ultimately determine the fate of humanity.\"\n\nFoundation Season 2 features returning stars Jared Harris as Hari Seldon, Lee Pace as Brother Day, Lou Llobell as Gaal Dornick, Leah Harvey Salvor Hardin, Laura Birn as Eto Demerzel, Cassian Bilton as Brother Dawn, and Terrence Mann as Brother Dusk. It also introduces newcomers to the series, including Isabella Laughland, Kulvinder Ghir, Ella-Rae Smith, Holt McCallany, Rachel House, Nimrat Kaur, Ben Daniels, and Dimitri Leonidas. David S. Goyer is Foundation's showrunner.\n\nFoundation returned for its second season on Friday, July 14th. New episodes debut on Apple TV+ on Fridays.\n\nEditors note: This interview was conducted prior to the SAG actors' strike."

    "text": "This 52-year-old British-American film director is the genius behind some of the past two decades\u2019 biggest \u2013 and most mind-boggling \u2013 cinematic moments, including Memento (2001), The Dark Knight (2008), Interstellar (2014), Dunkirk (2017) and Tenet (2020).\n\nSo, one burning question remains: who\u2019s the wealthiest director of them all? We asked the internet whizzes over at Celebrity Net Worth to find out.\n\nAmong the auteurs who built their reputation on both writing and directing in their own iconoclastic style are Inception and Interstellar brainiac Christopher Nolan, who\u2019s all set to unleash his much-awaited Oppenheimer this July; and James Cameron, the Terminator-to-Titanic maestro who kept the hype alive for last year\u2019s Avatar 2 , well over a decade after its first instalment hit the screens.\n\nWe have iconic figures like George Lucas, the genius who created the multiplex-blowing Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises, and Peter Jackson, the mastermind behind The Lord of the Rings and Hobbit film adaptations.\n\nThey are the ones responsible for what you see on the screen \u2013 making those impeccable casting choices and shaping the overall vision of the production.\n\nWhile we often find ourselves captivated by the glamorous ( and handsomely rewarded ) actors and actresses bringing beloved films and TV shows to life, let\u2019s not forget that it\u2019s the brilliant minds behind the camera \u2013 the directors \u2013 who truly deserve our gratitude.\n\nHis latest film, Oppenheimer, has generated plenty of buzz ahead of its release this July, covering the true story of J. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Peaky Blinder Cillian Murphy), the theoretical physicist who developed the world\u2019s first nuclear bomb.\n\n11. J.J. Abrams \u2013 US$300 million\n\nJ.J. Abrams attends the 2020 Vanity Fair Oscar Party at Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in Beverly Hills, California, in February 2020. Photo: Getty Images\n\nJ.J. Abrams, 57, is best known as sci-fi whizz \u2013 with the dubious honour of helming fresh instalments in the notoriously rivalled Star Trek and Star Wars universes. The American film and TV series director\u2019s most famous works include Felicity (1999), Alias (2001-2005), Mission: Impossible III (2006), Star Trek (2009) and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2009).\n\n10. Ivan Reitman \u2013 US$300 million\n\nDirector Ivan Reitman accepts the lifetime achievement award at the Big Screen Achievement Awards at CinemaCon in Las Vegas, US, in March 2014. Photo: AP\n\nOne of the least immediately recognisable names on this list, the late, great Ivan Reitman made his mark with 1984\u2019s Ghostbusters and its 1989 sequel, and comedies like My Super Ex-Girlfriend (2006) and No Strings Attached (2011). The Czechoslovakian-Canadian filmmaker was worth an estimated US$300 million at the time of his death at age 75, in 2022.\n\n9. Ridley Scott \u2013 US$400 million\n\nDirector Ridley Scott on the set of the film, The Martian. Photo: Peter Mountain\n\nThis Englishman made his claim to fame with Alien back in 1979 and has since directed a string of bona fide classics including Blade Runner (1982), Thelma & Louise (1991), G.I. Jane (1997), Gladiator (2000) and Hannibal (2001). More recent works like The Martian (2015) and House of Gucci (2021) have added to his US$400 million fortune, while his forthcoming historical epic Napoleon will star acting legend Joaquin Phoenix.\n\nScott, 85, has also been tapped to work on multiple Chanel No 5 ads over his decades-long career.\n\n8. Francis Ford Coppola \u2013 US$400 million\n\nFilmmaker and winemaker Francis Ford Coppola, poses for a picture at Grand Hyatt in Wan Chai in October 2012. Photo: May Tse\n\nA totemic figure in every sense of the word, in the 70s FFC was responsible for both the genre-defining Godfather saga and the harrowing Vietnam war portrait Apocalypse Now. While his later work never mounted the same critical peaks, he continued to make bank in later years with Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula (1992) and Twixt (2011). The 84-year-old American\u2019s daughter Sofia is the filmmaker behind Lost in Translation and Marie Antoinette.\n\n7. Mel Gibson \u2013 US$425 million\n\nAmerican actor Mel Gibson arrives on the red carpet for the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts Awards (AACTA) in Sydney, Australia, in December 2016. Photo: EPA\n\nA tricky one here, as Mel Gibson no doubt made the bulk of his cash through acting. However, he is a director of note, too, and the 67-year-old New Yorker has proven his talents helming films including Braveheart (1995), of which he also stars in, The Passion of the Christ (2004) and Hacksaw Ridge (2016).\n\n6. Michael Bay \u2013 US$450 million\n\nHollywood director Michael Bay, who was in Hong Kong for the filming of Transformers: Age of Extinction, in October 2013. Photo: Nora Tam\n\nKnown for making big-budget, fast-paced films, Michael Bay ranks No 6 on this list \u2013 the bulk of which can likely be chalked up to his role steering five movies in the Transformers franchise. However the divisive 58-year-old also counts earlier epic smashes Bad Boys (1995), The Rock (1996), Armageddon (1998) and Pearl Harbour (2001) on his CV.\n\n5. Tyler Perry \u2013 US$800 million\n\nTyler Perry attends his studio\u2019s grand opening gala at Tyler Perry Studios in October 2019, in Atlanta. Photo: Getty Images\n\nWith nearly a billion bucks in the bank, Tyler Perry comes in strong at No 5 on this list. While it\u2019s not all made from directing work, the 53-year-old multi-hyphenate showbiz guru \u2013 who\u2019s good pals with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle , and Oprah Winfrey \u2013 has brought us plenty of comedic relief with the Madea franchise, Meet the Browns (2009-2010), Ruthless (2020-2023) and more.\n\n4. James Cameron \u2013 US$800 million\n\nCanadian filmmaker James Cameron poses during a photocall for Avatar: The Way of Water in London, UK, in December 2022. Photo: AFP\n\nAfter making plenty off The Terminator film franchise, Titanic (1997) and Avatar (2009), Cameron bought himself the luxury of time, waiting some 13 years for the technology to catch up with his vision to realise last year\u2019s Avatar: The Way of Water. Making up for lost time? The 68-year-old Canadian filmmaker has two more instalments planned.\n\n3. Peter Jackson \u2013 US$1.5 billion\n\nDirector Peter Jackson arrives at the Los Angeles premiere of The Hobbit: The Battle Of The Five Armies in Los Angeles, California, in December 2014. Photo: AP\n\nThe first billionaire on our list is none other than Peter Jackson, the New Zealander who took into his hands the challenging yet (deeply) rewarding task of taking The Lord of the Rings saga to the big screen.\n\nActor Elijah Wood portrays Frodo in a scene from The Lord of The Rings: The Return of The King. Photo: Handout\n\nThis 61-year-old film maestro can thank his LOTR and Hobbit trilogies income for his place in the 10-figure club \u2013 those films have grossed US$6 billion worldwide, per Forbes. He sold a chunk of his Weta digital film effects shop to Unity Software for US$1.6 billion in cash and stock in 2021.\n\n2. Steven Spielberg \u2013 US$8 billion\n\nUS director Steven Spielberg speaks onstage during the 92nd Oscars at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, California, in February 2020. Photo: AFP\n\nAnother household name who\u2019s made billions over the years is Steven Spielberg. While accounts differ, Celebrity Net Worth estimates he has US$8 billion in his account.\n\nKnown as the \u201cKing of Entertainment\u201d, the 76-year-old\u2019s technical genius is beyond dispute, bringing to life unforgettable cinematic gems like Jaws (1975), E.T. (1982), Jurassic Park (1993), Schindler\u2019s List (1993), Catch Me if you Can (2002) and of course the first four iconic Indiana Jones films (James Mangold took over for this summer\u2019s fifth outing).\n\n1. George Lucas \u2013 US$10 billion\n\nStar Wars creator George Lucas poses with stormtroopers, characters in the Star Wars movies, at the Star Wars: Where Science Meets the Imagination exhibition in Boston, US, in 2005. Photo: Reuters\n\nGeorge Lucas, 79, has accumulated an \u2013 ahem \u2013 galactic fortune of US$10 billion, according to Celebrity Net Worth, anyway. And he\u2019s only directed six films in his life.\n\nHis third movie however, was none other than Star Wars (1977), and he held onto creative control \u2013 and the lucrative merchandise rights! \u2013 of the franchise forevermore. (He only stepped back into the chair, some 22 years later, to direct the series\u2019 \u201cfirst\u201d three episodes \u2013 his fourth, fifth, sixth and final directional credits, 1999-2005).\n\nThere\u2019s also the small matter of conceiving and producing the blockbuster Indiana Jones series \u2013 and then getting frenemy Spielberg to direct it \u2026\n\nIn 2012, Lucas added a hefty lump sum to his net worth by selling his Lucasfilm production company to Disney for US$4.1 billion in stock and cash, per Forbes. The force is very strong with this one."

The consequence of his painstaking commitment to his style is a lack of substance at times \u2014 a heavy criticism of \u201cTenet,\u201d Nolan\u2019s most recently released film prior to \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cOppenheimer\u201d fits right in with his best work at times, it occasionally falls into the exact same pitfalls that hold his other movies back from being full-on masterpieces.\n\n\u201cOppenheimer,\u201d starring Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, details the life of the \u201cfather of the atomic bomb\u201d as he races to assemble a team of scientists and develop the infamous weapon before rival scientists in enemy countries. Amid this already monumental challenge, he struggles with accusations of being a communist ally and an increasingly complicated personal life.\n\nThe story can\u2019t reasonably be criticized, as it is a cinematic retelling of Oppenheimer\u2019s real life, but the way Nolan chooses to tell the story is somewhat questionable.\n\nNolan is known for directing blockbusters like superhero movies, and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d can sometimes feel like a superhero origin story rather than a true biopic. Cameos and name drops of famous scientists are shot like easter eggs viewers might expect to see in a Marvel film; moreover, the dialogue features quips and one-liners that seem thoroughly out of place.\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d is at its best when it focuses on Murphy\u2019s brilliant performance and the deep dive into Oppenheimer\u2019s psychology, more akin to the individualistic character study expected of a biopic.\n\nAn issue Nolan runs into even in his most successful movies is the repeated use of female characters\u2019 suffering to bring emotional depth to his main characters \u2014 a martyrized manic pixie dream girl of sorts.\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d is based on a true story, so Nolan didn\u2019t write these characters from scratch, but he did purposefully select what parts of their real-life story to show. While Oppenheimer\u2019s wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) is developed well, the treatment of Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), his first love and on-and-off-again relationship, is shockingly disappointing for someone so important to Oppenheimer\u2019s story.\n\nShe has very limited scenes \u2014 a shame in and of itself because of Pugh\u2019s stage presence \u2014 and when she does appear, she acts more as a hardship for Oppenheimer to overcome rather than her own distinct person. Nolan neglects not only to pay much attention to Tatlock\u2019s own accomplishments as a brilliant scientist but also her struggles with her sexuality, a defining characteristic of her own life as well as of her relationship with Oppenheimer.\n\nIn doing so, he takes a complex real-world person and makes her one-dimensional. In fact, it\u2019s almost implied Tatlock\u2019s struggles with mental health weren\u2019t due to the pressure of being a non-heteronormative person in the 1940s, but rather because of her failing relationship with Oppenheimer.\n\nWhile the movie is ultimately an Oppenheimer biopic and not a Jean Tatlock biopic, you\u2019d think that a person arguably more consequential to Oppenheimer\u2019s life than his own wife would be treated with the care she deserves, especially when failing to do so sacrifices historical accuracy.\n\nAnother common struggle of Nolan\u2019s that is seen again in \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is his approach to pacing. The movie actually moves through Oppenheimer\u2019s life fairly quickly; however, Nolan chooses to show so much of the story that the plot still seems slow at times, especially due to the immense number of time jumps back and forth through Oppenheimer\u2019s career.\n\nFor instance, if the ignition of the Trinity test \u2014 the first atomic bomb ever dropped and the culmination of Oppenheimer\u2019s life\u2019s work \u2014 was the peak of action and build-up in the movie, \u201cOppenheimer\u201d might have one of the longest third acts in all of cinema.\n\nThe second half of the movie deals with a series of trials faced by Oppenheimer and adjacent scientists, soldiers and politicians. While it is extremely tense and enjoyable in a manner reminiscent of political dramas, what audiences came to see had already exploded by then, and the film\u2019s remainder may drag for those less interested in the politics of it all.\n\nNolan urged the film community to see \u201cOppenheimer\u201d in specific formats leading up to its release, saying that IMAX 70mm is the way he intended it to be seen. However, only 19 theaters with the capacity to show IMAX 70mm exist in the entire United States, so the option to see it as Nolan intended isn\u2019t viable for most people.\n\nWhile Nolan and other experts said audiences would still enjoy it in other theaters, a question must be asked when the needle is pushed from a movie being an engaging narrative to a sensory spectacle. The best movies should be able to be enjoyed anywhere, simply accentuated by the magic of a theater.\n\nWhile \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is without a doubt entertaining, it does feel as though the correlation between the size of the screen it is viewed on and the overall audience experience is far too intertwined.\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d is simultaneously emblematic of Nolan\u2019s greatest strengths and weaknesses, but it can never be faulted for a lack of spectacle. It should be criticized out of respect for its ambition; great works of art intrinsically invite criticism due to the boundaries they have to push. \u201cOppenheimer\u201d grips the audience with its unique blend of psychological despair and American patriotism, and despite its faults, is still a spectacle worth seeing on the big screen.\n\nRating: 3.5/5"

Sherwin\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning book \u201cAmerican Prometheus,\u201d tells the definitive story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, known as the father of the atomic bomb. The film, starring Cillian Murphy as the eponymous scientist, pulls straight from the 700-page biography, which traces Oppenheimer\u2019s life starting with his time at Cambridge, where he earned a reputation as an intellectual prodigy. As a physicist, Oppenheimer made significant contributions to quantum mechanics and theoretical physics, earning him great respect among his peers.\n\nThe narrative takes a dramatic turn with the onset of World War II, when Oppenheimer was appointed as the scientific director of the Manhattan Project, a top-secret government initiative aimed at developing the first atomic bomb. His leadership and organizational skills were instrumental to the project, which culminated with the devastating nuclear weapons dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing over 200,000 Japanese people.\n\nIn his introduction to the screenplay, Bird praises Nolan\u2019s skill in extremely complex life story and miraculously turning it into \u201cvisual art that is faithful both to the history and the man.\u201d\n\nWhen Bird read Nolan\u2019s screenplay, he was \u201cstruck by how faithful it was to the book, capturing what was always most important to Sherwin: the paradoxes at the heart of Oppenheimer\u2019s character and the intimate details that dovetailed with enormous plate shifts of world history.\u201d\n\nBuy Nolan\u2019s complete \u201cOppenheimer\u201d script below:"

    "text": "Nolan demonstrated this way back in Memento with the resolution to the Sammy Jankis story. After getting to the end of his narrative, Leonard realizes that he\u2019s forgotten who he\u2019s talking to. Eventually, we learn that Leonard misremembers the Jankis story; that he\u2019s combined it with his own life to give himself a sense of justice. But the tragedy of Leonard\u2019s self-deception is better relayed in the panic Pearce plays, tightening his body and jerking toward the phone. It\u2019s better relayed by the black-and-white photography, which uses lighting to highlight shades of gray, suggesting that the truth isn\u2019t as simple as it seems.\n\nThe Human Heart of Nolan\u2019s Cinema\n\nNolan\u2019s latest film Oppenheimer is full of memorable moments, but none as striking as the speech the title character (Cillian Murphy) gives after the bomb he and the scientists of Los Alamos created was then dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. The camera trails behind Oppenheimer as he walks through a stomping and cheering crowd, searching for his composure before he reaches the podium. Each jingoistic remark he manages to spit out earns more screaming applause until the sound suddenly drops out leaving only Murphy\u2019s unvarnished audio.\n\nOne might think that this decision would only intensify the importance of Oppenheimer\u2019s words, but it actually has the opposite effect. The specific things he\u2019s saying don\u2019t matter. They are empty boasts, war-crazed rabble-rousing that fail to match the importance of the bomb. Instead the sound design draws attention to the real concern of the scene: the weight of humanity. As Oppenheimer speaks, the background shakes and blurs, highlighting Murphy\u2019s crumbling and frail frame. An explosion of white illuminates the room, engulfing Murphy\u2019s gaunt face in light and shadow, drowning his heretofore striking blue eyes. Even before Oppenheimer\u2019s POV sees skin melting off the face of celebrants in the audience or charred bodies at his feet, we understand the extreme human cost of the moment.\n\nThe Oppenheimer speech is a surprisingly humane scene from a director who can sometimes seem chilly and intellectual. Movies such as Interstellar, Inception, and Tenet have established Nolan\u2019s reputation as a filmmaker in the Stanley Kubrick vein, more interested in technical bombast and puzzle-box plots than in human connections. But Nolan\u2019s muddled dialogue suggests otherwise. Take Dunkirk, the most small-scale film of his blockbuster era. Detractors might argue that Nolan\u2019s insistence on layered timelines distracts from what is a fairly simple plot about rescuing British soldiers from the titular beach.\n\nHowever, the movie isn\u2019t terribly interested in the plot mechanics. Instead it focuses on the human experiences of the people involved. By interlacing the three timelines, we get the full weight of Tommy\u2019s (Fionn Whitehead) attempts to escape the beach, of Dawson (Mark Rylance) crossing the channel to rescue the soldiers, and of the pilot with the callsign Fortis 1 (Tom Hardy) providing air support. Each one of these characters have significance, no matter how insignificant to the actual mechanics of the evacuation, simply because they are people.\n\nDunkirk succeeds by minimizing the dialogue, making most of Hardy\u2019s lines incomprehensible over the sound of his Spitfire engine. Even the most important words in the film, Winston Churchill\u2019s \u201cWe will fight them on the beaches\u201d speech get recited by a mumbling Tommy, who is nearly drowned out by Zimmer\u2019s soaring score. However, it works because we don\u2019t need those words barked with bombast, as Gary Oldman did playing Churchill in The Darkest Hour that same year. Instead we need to see the sadness in Hardy\u2019s eyes as his pilot lands his plane behind enemy lines, the relief on Alex\u2019s (Harry Styles) face when a civilian passes him a beer, the sad recognition shared between Dawson and his son (Tom Glynn-Carney)."

He really believes that his audiences can take this, and from the response that we're getting so far, the audiences are loving it.\"\n\nWhile big Hollywood productions have relied heavily on computers, telling the truth is important enough to Nolan that he avoids computer-generated special effects in favor of real explosions, and the result is stunning on a very big screen, especially given the large IMAX format.\n\nYou can watch the full episode in the media player above.\n\n----------\n\n* Get Eyewitness News Delivered\n\n* Follow us on YouTube\n\n* More local news\n\n* Send us a news tip\n\n* Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts\n\nSubmit a tip or story idea to Eyewitness News\n\nHave a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover?

    "text": "T\n\nDilemma\n\nhe story of the invention of the atomic bomb told in the new film \"Oppenheimer\" is a \"warning\" to the world as we grapple with artificial intelligence, insists the movie's director Christopher Nolan.The British-born maker of \"Memento\", \"Dunkirk\" and the \"Batman\" trilogy said he believes a lot of the anguish around technology \"in our imagination stems from (Robert) Oppenheimer,\" the physicist who helped invent nuclear weapons during World War II.What he and his team at the Los Alamos Laboratory in the United States did was \"the ultimate expression of science... which is such a positive thing, having the ultimate negative consequences,\" Nolan said.Like back then, the startling advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are raising similar fears about the dangers of a technology with potentially uncontrollable consequences.Some worry that AI could escape its creators and endanger humanity, much like scientists and others fretted eight decades ago with the dawn of the nuclear age.\"That was a moment in history. This is one too,\" Nolan's star Cillian Murphy\u2014who plays the haunted scientist\u2014told AFP while the pair were in Paris to promote the film, which opens across the globe this weekend.\"Artificial intelligence researchers refer to the present moment as an 'Oppenheimer moment',\" said Nolan, referring to the first atomic tests, when some feared nuclear fission would lead to an uncontrolled chain reaction that would pulverise the entire planet.Those now working on AI \"look at his story for some guidance as to what is their responsibility\u2014as to what they should be doing,\" Nolan said.\"But I don't think it offers any easy answers. It is a cautionary tale. It shows the dangers.\"\"The emergence of new technologies is quite often accompanied by a sense of dread about where that might lead,\" he argued.Nolan's drama turns on the dilemma this posed for the scientists working on the Manhattan Project, the codename of the drive to develop the bombs that were later dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\"They had lived through World War I and they were trying to end World War II,\" he said.Oppenheimer argued in vain for international control of nuclear weapons, hoping it would lead to peace.The director said many would argue that \"actually some stability in the world has been achieved through the existence of these weapons.\"Personally, I don't find that reassuring, but it just goes to show there are absolutely no easy answers to the dilemma.\"The war in Ukraine has reawakened the threat of nuclear Armageddon raising tensions between the superpowers not seen since the end of the Cold War.Actor Matt Damon, who plays General Leslie Groves, the head of the Manhattan Project, said the last year has been a reality check that the danger of nuclear disaster is still very much there.\"How did I forget about this? It's like the Cold War ended and my brain played a trick on me and said, 'OK, let's put that away, you don't have to worry about that anymore'\u2014which is absurd.\"But as soon as Russia invaded Ukraine \"suddenly overnight it became the most important thing for us all to think about again,\" said the 52-year-old star.\"Oppenheimer\" is facing off against \"Barbie\" in the biggest clash of Hollywood summer blockbusters, with both opening on the same day in a duel the media has dubbed \"Barbenheimer\"."

    "text": "They were exploding with glee.\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d fans were delighted to discover director Christopher Nolan had secretly cast veteran actor Gary Oldman in the 2023 biopic, Entertainment Weekly reported.\n\nOldman, 65, previously appeared in the Nolan-helmed \u201cDark Knight\u201d trilogy. He is also known for his Oscar-winning portrayal of Winston Churchill in the 2017 film \u201cDarkest Hour\u201d and Sirius Black in the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d films.\n\nThe Englishman\u2019s presence in the hotly anticipated summer blockbuster was kept under wraps \u2014 Oldman did not walk the film\u2019s red carpet when it premiered on July 11. His castmates notably left the screening to go on strike.\n\nIn the film, which tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the development of the atomic bomb, Oldman appears as a jubilant President Harry S. Truman, congratulating a guilt-ridden Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) on his achievement of building weapons of mass destruction.\n\n4 Gary Oldman is well known for his Oscar-winning portrayal of Winston Churchill in the 2017 film \u201cDarkest Hour.\u201d REUTERS/Maja Smiejkowska 2023 BAFTA Television Awards\n\n4 Oldman (not pictured), 65, did not walk the film\u2019s red carpet when the film premiered on July 11, mere hours before his castmates left the screening to go on strike. Samir Hussein/WireImage\n\nThe scene continues with Oppenheimer expressing that he has \u201cblood on his hands,\u201d a comment that reportedly angered Truman during the real-life meeting following the annihilation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nPrior to the release of the film, Murphy, 47, confirmed that the \u201cState of Grace\u201d actor would be a part of the film but did not specify the role Nolan, 52, had asked him to play.\n\n\u201cFor me, every day, I was working with the best actors in the world, every single day,\u201d said Murphy during EW\u2019s \u201cAround the Table.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d look at the call sheet and there\u2019d be, like, Gary Oldman one day, and then Ken Branagh, and then these guys,\u201d said the actor gesturing to co-stars Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Robert Downey Jr. \u201cIt was very hard to be cynical when you\u2019re working with that level of talent.\u201d\n\n4 The film tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the development of the atomic bomb. Universal Pictures via AP\n\n4 Oldman appears as a jubilant President Harry S. Truman congratulating a guilt-ridden Oppenheimer (Murphy, above) on his achievement of building weapons of mass destruction. \u00a9Universal/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nThe commercially successful flick, which The Post\u2019s Johnny Oleksinski called a \u201cmasterpiece,\u201d has stirred up some controversy.\n\nIn a notable departure for the typically chaste Nolan, \u201cOppenheimer\u201d has been getting buzz \u2014 both good and bad \u2014 for including sex scenes.\n\nAccording to the director, it was impossible to tell the story without sex.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at Oppenheimer\u2019s life and you look at his story, that aspect of his life, the aspect of his sexuality, his way with women, the charm that he exuded, it\u2019s an essential part of his story,\u201d said Nolan of the eyebrow-raising scenes between the titular character and Florence Pugh\u2019s Jean Tatlock.\n\n\u201cIt felt very important to understand their relationship and to really see inside it and understand what made it tick without being coy or allusive about it \u2014 but to try to be intimate, to try and be in there with him and fully understand the relationship that was so important to him.\u201d\n\nOne steamy moment was even called out as \u201ca scathing attack on Hinduism\u201d by India\u2019s government.\n\nThe scene in question shows Oppenheimer and Tatlock engaged in sexual intercourse when Tatlock asks him to read a passage from the \u201cBhagavad Gita\u201d while they continue to have sex.\n\nAn Indian official later slammed the scene in a tweet.\n\n\u201cIt has come to our notice that the movie \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 contains a scene which makes a scathing attack on Hinduism,\u201d tweeted Uday Mahurkar, an information commissioner for the Indian government, to Nolan.\n\n\u201cAs per social media reports, a scene in the movie shows a woman [making] a man read \u2018Bhagwad Geeta\u2019 aloud while getting over him and doing sexual intercourse.\n\n\u201cShe is holding Bhagwad Geeta in one hand, and the other hand seems to be adjusting the position of their reproductive organs,\u201d Mahurkar\u2019s tweet continues. \u201cThe Bhagwad Geeta is one of the most revered scriptures of Hinduism. Geeta has been the inspiration for countless sanyasis, brahmacharis and legends who live a life of self-control and perform selfless noble deeds.\u201d\n\nMahurkar calls the scene \u201ca direct assault on religious beliefs of a billion tolerant Hindus.\u201d\n\nThe official then asked if Nolan would \u201cremove this scene from your film across the world,\u201d adding: \u201cShould you choose to ignore this appeal it would be deemed as a deliberate assault on Indian civilization.\u201d"

If yes, then you understand well why Nolan is considered one of the most acclaimed directors in the world.\n\nKnown for his unique approach to filmmaking, including a no-CGI policy, Nolan has set the internet ablaze with his latest outing, Oppenheimer. Actors from all over the world aspire to be a part of Nolan's project, but there've been some who've turned down exciting roles in blockbuster movies like Memento, Interstellar, The Dark Knight, Inception, and more. And one of these actors is Indian.

However, he turned down the offer as he feared that the role of the Caped Crusader might negatively impact his career. In 2020, Hartnett told The Metro, \"I didn't want to be boxed into that superhero type. Back then a lot of actors had to fight really hard to get their career back after they played those characters.\"\n\nThe 45-year-old American actor recently featured in Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer as Ernest Lawrence - an American nuclear physicist who played an instrumental role in creating the world's first atomic bomb.\n\n2.

    "text": "The wartime Soviet intelligence services had a codename for the Manhattan Project, the US\u2019s plan to build an atom bomb: Enormoz. Christopher Nolan\u2019s new film about it is absolutely Enormoz, maybe his most enormoz so far: a gigantic, post-detonation study, a PTSD narrative procedure filling the giant screen with a million agonised fragments that are the shattered dreams and memories of the project\u2019s haunted, complex driving force, J Robert Oppenheimer, a brilliant physicist with the temperament of an artist who gave humanity the means of its own destruction.\n\nThe main event is that terrifying first demonstration: the Trinity nuclear test in the New Mexico desert in July 1945, when Oppenheimer is said to have silently pondered (and later intoned on TV) Vishnu\u2019s lines from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita: \u201cNow I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds \u2026\u201d\n\nThis is the big bang, and no one could have made it bigger or more overwhelming than Nolan. He does this without simply turning it into an action stunt \u2013 although this movie, for all its audacity and ambition, never quite solves the problem of its own obtuseness: filling the drama at such length with the torment of genius-functionary Oppenheimer at the expense of showing the Japanese experience and the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nNolan moves back and forth in time, either side of the historic 1945 firebreak, giving us Oppenheimer\u2019s beginnings as a young scientist, lonely and unhappy, electrified by the new developments in quantum mechanics, the young leftist who never became a Communist party member but whose anti-fascism galvanised his desire to develop the bomb before the Nazis could, directing the work of hundreds of scientists.\n\nWatch a trailer for Oppenheimer\n\nLater in the 50s, there is the disillusioned, compromised administrator, hounded by the McCarthyites for his communist connections, nauseated by his own pointless celebrity, by his failure to establish postwar international atomic control and by a single denied thought: the Nazis surrendered long before there was any suggestion they had the weapon, and bombing the defeated Japanese at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was merely to cow the Russians with a ruthless demonstration of the US\u2019s nuclear mastery.\n\nCillian Murphy is an eerily close lookalike for Oppenheimer with his trademark hat and pipe, and is very good at capturing his sense of solitude and emotional imprisonment, giving us the Oppenheimer million-yard stare, eyeballs set in a gaunt skull, seeing and foreseeing things he cannot process.\n\nMatt Damon is the boorish Lt Gen Leslie Groves, Oppenheimer\u2019s exasperated military minder; Kenneth Branagh is his genial scientific hero and mentor Niels Bohr; Robert Downey Jr is the duplicitous Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss; Florence Pugh plays his lover Jean Tatlock, whose heart he broke, while Emily Blunt is his wife, Kitty, also badly treated. Tom Conti plays the sorrowfully detached Albert Einstein, and it has to be said that Nolan, rightly or wrongly, uses non-Jewish actors for Oppenheimer and Einstein, two of the most famous Jewish people in history and in fact doesn\u2019t quite get to grips with the antisemitism that Oppenheimer faced as an assimilated secular American Jew.\n\nAfter the first test, Oppenheimer is reported to have said \u2018Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds\u2019. Photograph: Melinda Sue Gordon/Universal Pictures\n\nThere is a horribly gripping scene showing Oppenheimer\u2019s formative experience as an unhappy graduate student in England at Christ\u2019s College, Cambridge. He suffered what amounted to a psychotic breakdown and left a poisoned apple on the desk of his testy supervisor Patrick Blackett (James D\u2019Arcy), which Blackett fortunately didn\u2019t notice and didn\u2019t eat. Nolan coolly invites to see this as a parable for the lost Eden of a more innocent prewar physics, with Oppenheimer as a serpent with Adam\u2019s foolish innocence. And of course there is the creeping biographical irony: how terribly close Oppenheimer came to \u2026 killing someone.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Film Weekly Free newsletter Take a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After the successful detonation of the Hiroshima bomb, Murphy shows us Oppenheimer in shock, but also realising he has to address an audience of cheering colleagues and subordinates. He knows it is his duty as a leader to congratulate them and be upbeat, stammering out some fatuous remark about how the Japanese \u201cdidn\u2019t like it\u201d, then realising how callous that was, and beginning to hallucinate the horror. Of course, Oppenheimer did not witness the actual use of his weapon, he never saw anything becoming death, the destroyer of worlds, and Nolan takes the decision to look away from it too, to stay in the US, to stay with Oppenheimer himself in all his sudden tragic irrelevance.\n\nPerhaps the film\u2019s most important moment is the one that addresses its own flaw: the legendary postwar encounter in the White House Oval Office between Oppenheimer and President Harry S Truman (played by Gary Oldman), the man who took the final executive decision to drop the bomb. Nolan and Murphy show how Oppenheimer shrinks and cringes into the couch in front of him, like a scared little boy, apparently wanting something like absolution from the president and mumbling that he feels he has \u201cblood on his hands\u201d. Angry and baffled, Truman tells him curtly that all this is his responsibility as president and asks a very pertinent question: does Oppenheimer think the Japanese care who made the bomb? No, they want to know who dropped it. It\u2019s true: concentrating on Oppenheimer is simultaneously fascinating and beside the larger historical point.\n\nIn the end, Nolan shows us how the US\u2019s governing class couldn\u2019t forgive Oppenheimer for making them lords of the universe, couldn\u2019t tolerate being in the debt of this liberal intellectual. Oppenheimer is poignantly lost in the kaleidoscopic mass of broken glimpses: the sacrificial hero-fetish of the American century.\n\nOppenheimer is released on 20 July in Australia, and 21 July in the US and UK."

    "text": "\u201cBarbenheimer\u201d is officially here, and the battle that\u2019s been referred to as the bomb versus bombshell is about to ignite the box office.\n\nGreta Gerwig\u2019s cotton candy-colored \u201cBarbie,\u201d starring Margot Robbie as the plastic, fantastic doll, is expected to generate a huge $95 million to $110 million from 4,200 North American theaters over the weekend. Given the omnipresence of \u201cBarbie\u201d (the marketing is practically inescapable, with enough memes and marketing tie-ins to last a lifetime), initial estimates are all over the place. Warner Bros. is projecting a more conservative $75 million to start, while rivals and exhibitors believe the PG-13 movie could make as much as $140 million between Friday and Sunday.\n\nIn any case, \u201cBarbie\u201d will claim the top spot over Christopher Nolan\u2018s atomic bomb drama \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d which is aiming to collect a solid $50 million from 3,600 cinemas through Sunday. Universal is backing the R-rated historical biopic, which cost $100 million.\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d runs at three hours (\u201cBarbie\u201d clocks in at just under two), which may limit the screenings per day. However, Nolan\u2019s epic will benefit from premium large format screens like Imax, which is dedicating its entire footprint to his film for three weeks.\n\nTogether, the seemingly different blockbusters with twin release dates are fueling the phenomenon known as \u201cBarbenheimer.\u201d AMC Theatres, the nation\u2019s biggest cinema chain, reported that 40,000 people have already purchased tickets for double features of \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d on the same day \u2014 up 20,000 from last week.\n\nThe National Association of Theatre Owners, the industry\u2019s trade organization, is projecting that more than 200,000 moviegoers will attend same-day viewings of \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d at theaters across North America. And that\u2019s \u201cin addition to the millions of worldwide moviegoers who are planning to see both films on different days this weekend,\u201d says Michael O\u2019Leary, president and CEO of NATO.\n\nThe $145 million-budgeted \u201cBarbie\u201d stars too many A-listers to name, but we\u2019ll give it a shot: Ryan Gosling, Issa Rae, Dua Lipa, Simu Liu, Helen Mirren, John Cena and Will Ferrell round out the cast of the fantasy comedy, which follows Barbie and Ken as they leave the comfort and familiarity of Barbie-Land on a quest for self-discovery in the real world.\n\n\u201cOppenheimer,\u201d adapted by Nolan from the Pulitzer Prize-winning book \u201cAmerican Prometheus,\u201d is an equally star-studded character study about theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. Cillian Murphy plays the man who led the development of the atomic bomb, alongside an ensemble of Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Alden Ehrenreich.\n\nThe potent combination of \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d as well as last weekend\u2019s champion \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One,\u201d is expected to fuel one of the biggest box office weekends in ages. Summer season has otherwise produced a string of underperforming options, like \u201cThe Flash,\u201d \u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\u201d and \u201cRuby Gillman, Teenage Kraken.\u201d\n\nTom Cruise\u2019s newest \u201cMission\u201d looks to add $28 million to $30 million in its second weekend of release, a decline of roughly 50% from its debut. The seventh installment in Paramount and Skydance\u2019s globe-trotting action franchise opened to $56 million in North America and $234 million globally. It cost $291 million before marketing, so Ethan Hunt\u2019s latest death-defying adventure needs to remain a draw throughout the summer to justify that price tag.\n\nElsewhere, the unlikely box office hit \u201cSound of Freedom\u201d is imminently crossing the $100 million mark, which will put the film among the top 16 highest grossing of the year. The low-budget, faith-based movie about child sex trafficking has generated a remarkable $85.7 million to date. That\u2019s thanks mostly to the religious and conservative media groups that have rallied behind the film.\n\nPaul Dergarabedian, a senior Comscore analyst, calls \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d a \u201cmovie marketers dream come true.\u201d He adds that the craze is \u201ccreating a rising tide of interest that should also boost the fortunes of \u2018MI7\u2019 and \u2018Sound of Freedom\u2019 as moviegoers flood the multiplex in search of movies to catch on the big screen.\u201d"

    "text": "CNN \u2014\n\n\u201cThe bomb, Dimitri. The hydrogen bomb,\u201d an exasperated US president reminds his Soviet counterpart in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 1964 classic \u201cDr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.\u201d\n\nAs if the bomb could ever be forgotten. At the height of the Cold War, when mutually assured destruction was at its crazed height, nuclear warfare found itself abstracted through humor \u2013 perhaps the only reasonable way to treat something so fearsome. The bomb was a sick joke to be ridden, sometimes metaphorically, sometimes literally, a totem of mankind\u2019s ingenuity and stupidity riveted shut and let fly. To look at it head-on was to be blinded by its glare; the power it wrought was too absurd \u2014 and too close \u2014 to countenance. Best to send in the clowns.\n\nIt would have seemed inconceivable then, but the atomic bomb did fade out of mind. In the 21st Century, other existential threats have reared their heads. Yet the nuclear threat feels closer today than it has for generations. And it\u2019s precisely at this moment that Christopher Nolan is asking audiences to look it soberly in the eye.\n\n\u201cOur relationship with nuclear weapons is very complicated,\u201d Nolan told CNN. \u201cThe fear ebbs and flows. It\u2019s almost like humanity can only deal with one apocalypse at a time, and there\u2019s so many issues to worry about.\u201d\n\nBut worry many will after watching \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d his latest and perhaps greatest film to date. As the name suggests, Nolan has taken on the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scientific genius and conflicted godfather of the atomic bomb. Working in IMAX, the director conjures an overwhelming, altogether haunting retelling of the story of the bomb\u2019s creation and its fallout across three taut hours that pushes the limits of the medium itself.\n\nCillian Murphy as godfather of the atomic bomb J. Robert Oppenheimer in \"Oppenheimer.\" Universal Pictures\n\nNolan\u2019s screenplay \u2013 written, unusually, in the first person \u2013 drew from definitive biography \u201cAmerican Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer\u201d by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin, but stops short of its forensic take on the physicist. Flitting between color and monochrome \u2013 the director has described the former as a subjective and the latter an objective lens on events \u2013 we mostly experience the narrative through Oppenheimer\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u201cWe have to get the facts right. We have to be guided by history. But we\u2019re trying to give the audience an experience. We\u2019re trying to really entertain and engage in a meaningful way,\u201d Nolan explained.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a subjective telling,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to not judge the man. We\u2019re trying to experience things with him and understand.\u201d\n\nOppenheimer\u2019s piercing blue stare is inhabited by Cillian Murphy, the director\u2019s long-time collaborator and first-time leading man. \u201cOh, there was a man,\u201d Murphy said of his character. \u201cI was so exhilarated to be given the opportunity \u2013 it\u2019s kind of a dream part. But it\u2019s so multifaced and massive, so you just dive in.\u201d\n\nMurphy plays Oppenheimer from a young student in Cambridge in the 1920s through to the post-war McCarthy era and beyond, without the aid of distracting de-aging CGI (the physicist died in 1967). Around him swirls a who\u2019s who of impeccably suited scientists, military men and politicians, along with the women in his life, wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) and lover Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) \u2013 a vast supporting cast in the truest sense.\n\n\u201cWatching Cillian and Chris together, it was two people at the height of their abilities,\u201d said Matt Damon, who stars as Leslie Groves, the brusque general overseeing the Manhattan Project.\n\n\u201cIt felt the most like watching when Spielberg did \u2018Saving Private Ryan,\u2019\u201d he added, \u201cwatching Chris Nolan with a story that\u2019s worthy of his vast ability. Everybody could feel it, so everybody came with everything they had and was like, \u2018Alright, how do we support this?\u2019\u201d\n\nA threat renewed\n\nFor most of Nolan\u2019s considerable cast, Oppenheimer\u2019s invention set the backdrop for their upbringings. \u201cThis was our existential threat growing up,\u201d recalled Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and later a political operator.\n\n\u201cWe did grow up at this time, but it\u2019s almost too much to engage with, so you push it out,\u201d said Damon. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019ve all been living under this sword of Damocles for 80 years \u2026 Our kids, it\u2019s not part of their experience to the extent that it should be.\u201d\n\nCillian Murphy alongside Christopher Nolan on the set of \"Oppenheimer.\" Melinda Sue Gordon/Universal Pictures\n\nNolan knows this only too well. \u201cI told one of my teenage sons what I was working on,\u201d he recalled. \u201cHe said to me, \u2018Well, does anybody really worry about that anymore?\u2019 This was a couple of years ago. By the time we finished shooting the film, unfortunately he wasn\u2019t asking that question anymore.\u201d\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine days before cameras started rolling, noted Murphy, and it was under that cloud that filming began in New Mexico, at a stand in for the Los Alamos HQ for the Manhattan Project.\n\nThe film has taken on troubling relevance, especially the passages set post-war, documenting an arms race that Oppenheimer warned against. Its examination of his legacy, from the physicist\u2019s perspective and the people around him, forms a devastating and complex coda.\n\nRobert Downey Jr. in \"Oppenheimer \" Universal Pictures\n\nToday, the ethical debate surrounding the bomb remains undimmed. But even if a war involving a nuclear power hadn\u2019t erupted in Europe in 2022, Nolan believes \u201cOppenheimer\u201d contains crossover anxieties.\n\n\u201c(Nuclear war) is unique in the threats that we face, but it also relates to a lot of our relationship \u2013 and particularly young people\u2019s relationship \u2013 with technology and technological innovation,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause ultimately, the atomic bomb, awful though it is and was, it was an incredible technological innovation.\u201d\n\nEighty years after the Trinity Test, technological innovation looks like artificial intelligence (AI), he offered, and the potential dangers of \u201cunleashing those things on the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of the scientists I speak to, a lot of the people who work in the tech sector I speak to, they worry about this,\u201d he added. \u201cThey see what they\u2019re doing as their Oppenheimer moment, and they look to his story to give some kind of guidance as to how the relationship between science, technology, government and society should function.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether Oppenheimer\u2019s story has answers to that,\u201d he added. \u201cIt certainly raises the questions, and in a way that I think we will find quite chilling.\u201d\n\n\"A lot of the scientists I speak to ... they see what they're doing as their Oppenheimer moment,\" Nolan said of the rise of AI. Universal Pictures\n\nKubrick had us laugh at the bomb because it felt like an appropriate coping mechanism. Now Nolan\u2019s fierce and sincere contemplation will awaken a new generation to its horrors \u2013 and that feels appropriate too.\n\nFor a director obsessed with the workings of time, the arrival of his latest movie is uncanny. But one senses the film will outlive this moment, and only burnish his reputation as one of the few blockbuster directors with the clout to pull off working at this scale.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always been this mystique around Nolan,\u201d Downey Jr. shared. \u201cThe spring-into-summer that the first \u2018Iron Man\u2019 came out (in 2008), people were like, \u2018Oh, this will do until \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d comes out.\u2019 So, you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s not a Chris Nolan.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a master filmmaker, there\u2019s no denying it,\u201d he added, \u201cand you don\u2019t get many of those per generation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think this film is kind of the apotheosis of his talent as a director,\u201d said Murphy. \u201cTo have had the privilege of working with him over the years and seeing him move towards this, it\u2019s phenomenal to witness.\u201d\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d is released in cinemas in the US and UK on July 21."

She\u2019s Mattel. He\u2019s the Manhattan Project.\n\nDirectors Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach\u2019s summer blockbuster Barbie (2023) is set to open in theaters on July 21, the same day as Christopher Nolan\u2019s long-anticipated film Oppenheimer (2023), a movie about the development of the atomic bomb. Many theaters across the country are screening these polar opposite movies back-to-back, and the notion of a double feature has the internet in absolute shambles. So what better way to cope than with a deluge of absurdly dark memes?\n\nAn unedited still from the actual Barbie (2023) trailer that feels like it should be in Oppenheimer (2023) (screenshot Maya Pontone/Hyperallergic via Twitter)\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the dual blockbuster opening, people are preparing for the emotional wreckage that will undoubtedly besiege them from the confluence of these films. Notably, Christopher Nolan told Wired reporters that some early viewers of Oppenheimer (2023) \u201cleft the movie absolutely devastated,\u201d which is, you know, super uplifting to hear.\n\nReal-life photographs of me after watching both films. (screenshot Maya Pontone/Hyperallergic via Twitter)\n\nThose who are seeing Oppenheimer (2023) before Barbie (2023) are calling the mash-up \u201cOppenbarbie,\u201d and those who are wrong and seeing the films in the reverse order are calling it \u201cBarbieheimer.\u201d\n\nThis meme from The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent (2022) has yet to get old for me. (screenshot Maya Pontone/Hyperallergic via Twitter)\n\nLike many others on the internet, I have strong opinions about how theatergoers should spend the day. The following meme is giving \u201cNo sleep. Bus. Club. Another club. Another club. Plane. Next place. No sleep\u201d:\n\nThe internet has opinions about how to spend the day. (screenshot Maya Pontone/Hyperallergic via Twitter)\n\nThe pairing of the two films has led some to make interesting observations of real-world phenomena that could fit the Barbie-Oppenheimer theme \u2014 such as this pair of surreal houses:\n\nAs they say, art imitates life. Or in this case, life imitates art? I don\u2019t know anymore. (screenshot Maya Pontone/Hyperallergic via Twitter)\n\n\u2026 Or this strange pink cloud that\u2019s either another hazardous \u201cgender reveal\u201d or (hopefully) an incredible PR stunt by the Barbie (2023) marketing team:\n\nAnother forest fire-causing gender reveal? Who knows! (screenshot Maya Pontone/Hyperallergic via Twitter)\n\nSpeaking of the Barbie (2023) marketing team, can we just take a moment to appreciate this bubble gum pink Xbox console? I, myself, was a Wii stan growing up, but even this video game set-up would have me begging my mom to drive me to the nearest Toys-R-Us. (RIP!)\n\nPlease, Mom? I need the Xbox Barbie Dream Edition. Everyone at school has one! (screenshot Maya Pontone/Hyperallergic via Instagram)\n\nOf course, this wouldn\u2019t be a proper meme round-up if I didn\u2019t include this spot-on Sopranos reference:\n\nThe real question is: Why isn\u2019t Adriana in Barbie (2023)? (screenshot Maya Pontone/Hyperallergic via Twitter)\n\nIf New Jersey Italian mafia jokes aren\u2019t your thing, perhaps this Avril Lavigne meme is. Can I make it any more obvious?\n\nHe was a skater boy. She said, \u201cSee ya later, boy.\u201d (screenshot Maya Pontone/Hyperallergic via Twitter)\n\nBut whether you decide to see Barbie (2023) then Oppenheimer (2023), or Oppenheimer (2023) then Barbie (2023), just remember that David Lynch did it first.\n\nAn important observation about Wild At Heart (1990) and the Twin Peaks film Fire Walk With Me (1992).

Forgive our confusion because Jim Halpert (Krasinski) from the U.S. version of The Office pulled a fast one recently by photo bombing the Oppenheimer cast at the film's recent New York City press day. Of course, Krasinski gets access because his wife, Emily Blunt, co-stars as J. Robert Oppenheimer's (Cillian Murphy) wife, Katherine \u201cKitty\u201d Oppenheimer.\n\nIt was actually Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss in the film, who posted the photo and added the cameo joke on his Instagram saying, \u201cWait, is that a Krasinski photobomb or might there be a surprise cameo???\u201d Downey Jr. is joined by his fellow cast members Blunt, Cillian Murphy and Matt Damon. We do have to wonder if Krasinski brought the pizza and beers because that's definitely the smart way to crash a party.\n\nThe junket interviews signifies the official press push for the historical epic which opens exclusively in theaters and IMAX on July 21. Downey Jr. also shared that he and the cast are off to Paris, France next for a world premiere. And then they'll return back to the United States for the domestic premiere before it hits theaters.\n\nOppenheimer is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and the late Martin J. Sherwin. Shot in both black and white and color, Nolan recently revealed to AP that there's a method to that visual language, with the color sections reflecting the perspective of Murphy's Oppenheimer and the black and white reflecting the more dogmatic approach of Downey's anti-Communist character, Lewis Strauss.\n\nDespite the disappointment of presumably not getting some Krasinski face-time in a supporting role for Oppenheimer, we'll just indulge ourselves in imagining the mother of all Halpert-esque, straight-to-camera reactions when Oppenheimer gets the green-light to test the atomic bomb in the movie.\n\nOppenheimer arrives exclusively on the big screen Friday, July 21 in a number of different formats.

Robert Oppenheimer when Tenet wrapped production.\n\nYou'd think Nolan would return the favor by offering Pattinson a prominent role in the atomic bomb thriller, but the actor is nowhere to be seen throughout the blockbuster's massive ensemble, which includes everyone from Cillian Murphy to Robert Downey Jr.\n\nRELATED: Oppenheimer Stars Explain Why Working with Christopher Nolan Is an \"Instant Yes\"\n\n\"He was busy,\" the filmmaker explained during an interview with entertainment journalist Tara Hitchcock, alluding to Pattinson's commitments to other projects like Mickey 17 and The Batman - Part II. \"He's very much in-demand these days.\"\n\nNevertheless, the book of Oppenheimer's speeches fortified the director's interest in the Manhattan Project, which Tenet directly references in a conversation between The Protagonist (John David Washington) and arms dealer Dimple Kapadia (Priya Singh).\n\n\"You're reading these great intellects trying to deal with the massive consequences of the way in which they've changed life forever for all of us,\" Nolan continued. \"And I really got hooked on the story.\"\n\nCillian Murphy is J. Robert Oppenheimer in Oppenheimer (2023). Photo: Universal Pictures\n\nWhile penning the screenplay for the 3-hour historical epic, Nolan drew on American Prometheus (the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography about the life and career of J. Robert Oppenheimer written by Kai Bird and the late Martin J. Sherwin). His notorious commitment to realism was taken to a new level here with the insistence that the Trinity test be recreated without the use of CGI imagery.\n\n\"Doing real-world effects and having us out in the desert with the actors, waiting for this incredible moment, it gave us some small feeling of what it must have been like to be there for the original detonation,\" Nolan said. \"It was thrilling and terrifying and beautiful and dangerous \u2014 all in equal measure.\"\n\nRELATED: Oppenheimer: Cillian Murphy Calls Atomic Bomb Thriller \"A Truly Essential Cinematic Experience\"\n\nIn addition to writing and directing, he also produced the feature alongside Emma Thomas (Nolan's wife and co-founder of their Syncopy production banner) and Charles Roven. J. David Wargo, James Woods, and Thomas Hayslip are executive producers.\n\nOppenheimer exclusively hits the big screen next Friday, July 21.

    "text": "The release of the Oppenheimer film, and the wave of (media) attention surrounding it, creates an opportunity to spark public attention on the risks of nuclear weapons and invite new audiences to get involved in the movement to abolish nuclear weapons. We can educate about the risks, and share a much-needed message of hope and resistance: Oppenheimer is about how nuclear weapons began, the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) is how we end them. That is why we have put together some resources for all ICAN campaigners - or anyone who is willing to take action- to use at local theatres around the world or to join the conversation online!\n\nWhat stand does the movie take on nuclear weapons?\n\nWe don\u2019t know yet, we will update you once the film has been released. Until the movie comes out, we won\u2019t know many details about the position the movie will take on nuclear weapons, beyond the trailer and the fact that the movie is based Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin\u2019s biography of Robert J. Oppenheimer, \u201cAmerican Prometheus.\u201d While initial interviews with the director and cast seem to hint at a real concern about nuclear weapons, mirroring some of Oppenheimer\u2019s own concerns, there is also risk that the movie ends up being \u2018bomb porn\u2019 that glorifies the development of nuclear weapons undermining the dangers of their production and use, or that the discourse centres only around the technical production of the movie, or that it leaves out a crucial part of this story: the catastrophic humanitarian impact of the weapon that Oppenheimer created.\n\nBut no matter what the movie shows, it is sparking a bump in social media conversations and online searches for more information about Oppenheimer, nuclear weapons, Trinity, the Manhattan Project, etc. That is why we have collected key talking points and background information on those impacts, and the risks of nuclear weapons below.\n\nFlyers\n\nWe know there are organisations already planning large-scale events that combine (private) screenings with panels or Q&As with experts on nuclear disarmament, but that is not the only way to take in person action. Flyering or offering yourself to do a 'talkback' at your local cinema after the show is a great way to engage movie-goers who have questions. We have created some useful materials you can easily print as flyers or postcards.\n\nSocial Media Materials\n\nWe have created a series of social media materials you can share to your organisation\u2019s account, though some may only be relevant once the movie is out. You can download them (zip) here or you can find the Canva template, for translations, here.\n\nYou can also encourage your supporters to share their own post by here: https://amplify.icanw.org/campaign/25773327-E379-4DBC-895A-8C96420F8B71 or if you would like to embed these one-click-share posts directly on your site, please get in touch with Lucero.\n\nGetting into local media\n\nIt may be possible to interest local media in our messaging around Oppenheimer in two ways\n\nIf you are planning any actions around Cinemas or your own public screenings of the film, you should issue a media advisory in advance to your local print/online, TV and radio outlets telling them what you will be doing so they can cover it if they want to.\n\nOnce you have seen the film, you could write a letter to the editor of the local newspaper.\n\nMedia advisory template\n\nYOUR LOGO\n\nMedia advisory\n\nHeadline (this should say simply and succinctly what you will doing eg XXXX will be engaging with audiences at the showing of Oppenheimer at XXXX cinema about the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons)\n\nYOUR LOCATION, DATE 2023\n\n(Here you put details of what you are doing in a maximum of 2 short paragraphs)\n\nFor more information contact:\n\nYOUR NAME AND CONTACT DETAILS\n\nAbout (name of your organisation)\n\n(here you can put some information about your organisation)\n\nTemplate: Letter to the Editor\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nI just saw the new Oppenheimer film, and, combined with increased reporting about Russian nuclear threats and rising nuclear tensions on the Korean peninsula, I wanted to share a note of optimism with others who may have left the film shaken by, or questioning, what they have seen..\n\nFirst, there\u2019s now a treaty that makes nuclear weapons, and everything to do with them, illegal. It\u2019s the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons that came into force in 2021, and it\u2019s already been signed by almost half of all UN members.\n\nSecond, the Nobel Prize-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) has transformed the anti-nuclear movement and provided a place for anyone- from members of parliament to city councillors to individual citizens like me - to get involved in ending all nuclear threats. This campaign is open to everyone, and as the film so poignantly reminded us, it\u2019s everyone\u2019s responsibility to do what they can to save the world.\n\nOppenheimer is about how nuclear weapons began; but now I\u2019m glad to be part of the way nuclear weapons will end.\n\nSincerely,\n\nXXXX\n\nBackground:\n\nFacts & Myths about nuclear weapons (and other questions raised by the movie)\n\nWhile the movie has not been released yet, we expect the interest in the movie will raise questions about nuclear weapons and resurface some problematic, yet frequently heard myths. That is why we have prepared an in-depth guide to tackle questions like: nuclear weapons ended WWII (or prevent war), nuclear deterrence means they\u2019ll never get used, so there\u2019s no problem, and so on. We will be updating this FAQ as more becomes known about the movie\u2019s stance.\n\nhttps://www.icanw.org/oppenheimer_facts_myths_nuclear_weapons\n\nOn Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project\n\nWho was Oppenheimer? Robert Oppenheimer was an American theoretical physicist. He was the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II, and is often credited as the \"father of the atomic bomb\" for his role in the Manhattan Project, the research and development undertaking that created the first nuclear weapons.\n\nDid Oppenheimer oppose nuclear weapons? Oppenheimer did not explicitly criticise the use of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. However in October 1945 he met President Truman to urge him to turn nuclear weapons over to international control in order to avoid a nuclear arms race, something Truman was unwilling to do. After the war, Oppenheimer joined the US Atomic Energy Commission which was set up to regulate the development of nuclear technology. In his capacity of Chair of the Commission he advocated for the development of low yield nuclear weapons and unsuccessfully opposed the development of the H-bomb and then fell foul of the anti-communist purges of the early 1950s and lost his security clearance and his role on the Commission. Later in his life, he avoided joining calls for nuclear disarmament despite being invited to do so.\n\nWhat was the Manhattan Project? In 1942, the Manhattan Project was established, with its first offices at 270 Broadway in Manhattan, thereby giving it the name the Manhattan Project. The project continued and expanded employing up to 130,000 people at numerous facilities.\n\nWhat did other Manhattan Project Scientists say about nuclear weapons? Joseph Rotblat was the only Manhattan Project Scientist that left the project after it was clear that Germany wasn\u2019t building nuclear weapons. The 1995 Nobel Peace Prize went to Joseph Rotblat and Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs \"for their efforts to diminish the part played by nuclear arms in international politics and, in the longer run, to eliminate such arms\u201d. In a memo on the eve of the Trinity test, four Manhattan Project scientists could not agree if this new weapon should ever be used in war - or whether it should be technically demonstrated and then eliminated.\n\nOn the Trinity Test and its impacts\n\nThe Trinity test (shown in the film)\n\nThe Trinity Test was conduced on July 16th 1945 at Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range, in New Mexico, United States. As the scientists behind the Manhattan project tested the first ever nuclear weapon, the \u201cGadget\u201d, safety came second: the fallout zone was dramatically underestimated, the effects were barely studied, and no one was evacuated.\n\nThe communities of the Trinity fallout zone call themselves the \u2018Tularosa Basin Downwinders\u2019 because radiation was carried downwind from the test site to their communities. Residents were not told about the test even as fallout \u2018snowed\u2019 over their farms, homes, and wells. The damage became clear almost immediately. In the months following Trinity (Aug, Sept, and Oct of 1945) infant mortality in New Mexico increased by 56%, many as a result of rare birth defects. Ionising radiation is particularly damaging to rapidly developing and dividing cells\u2014affecting infants, children, and pregnant women. But when authorities were alerted, nothing happened. The Downwinders were left to deal with a devastating legacy of health and environmental impacts for decades and have advocated for justice and compensation since.

    "text": "Photos courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures; Melinda Sue Gordon/Universal Pictures\n\nOne of the most hotly debated head-to-head box office match-ups of the year is just four weeks away. While much could change over the next month, here\u2019s how Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie and Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer are shaping up in preliminary tracking.\n\nBarbie\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures\n\nJuly 21, 2023 (WIDE)\n\nOpening Weekend Range: $55M-$85M\n\nDomestic Total Range: $120M-$226M\n\nPROS:\n\nBarbie has been a remarkable performer across the social media spectrum thanks to a vocal fan base and meme-driven activity across TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and other platforms.\n\nAs a generational brand, Barbie has strong appeal to women of various ages and should benefit from the voice of director and co-writer Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird, Little Women) and the presence of A-Listers Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as the leads.\n\nOutside of The Little Mermaid, very few of this summer\u2019s tentpole films are catering so directly to women, leaving Barbie positioned for a strong performance courting an under-served audience. Early sales reflect this with, with Barbie\u2019s day-one pre-sales coming in 46 percent higher than Mermaid\u2018s comparable period.\n\nCONS:\n\nIt\u2019s challenging at this stage to determine to what extent online and fandom buzz will translate to real world interest. That\u2019s especially true given the film\u2019s seemingly more mature focus; its satirical comedy bent could put a ceiling on family turnout relative to the broader multi-generational appeal of The Super Mario Bros. Movie.\n\nPremium screen footprints will be very low for Barbie, with other films dominating that space throughout July. That not only lowers Barbie\u2018s potential average ticket prices, but\u2014as audiences increasingly favor a premium viewing experience\u2014could have a negative impact on attendance.\n\nWhile early pre-sales are strong for previews on Wednesday and Thursday, it remains to be seen whether or not the film will be able to gain traction outside the die-hard fan base in the weeks ahead.\n\nOppenheimer\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\nJuly 21, 2023 (WIDE)\n\nOpening Weekend Range: $40M-$55M\n\nDomestic Total Range: $137M-$187M\n\nPROS:\n\nDirector Christopher Nolan himself is a reliable box office draw, as shown in the post-Dark Knight era of his career with the success of Dunkirk, Interstellar, and Inception.\n\nCounter-programming potential is strong, with Oppenheimer being one of the few thrillers aimed squarely at adults to receiving a massive marketing push in this day and age.\n\nThere\u2019s minimal direct competition moving into the late summer, with most of the wide releases coming to theaters in Oppenheimer\u2018s first few holdover frames being family-friendly movies.\n\nPre-sales are popping at this stage, with initial models pointing to preview results ahead of last summer\u2019s Nope and Nolan\u2019s own Dunkirk. General moviegoer interest prompted by strong word of mouth from preview audiences could create long-term backloading weeks into the film\u2019s theatrical run\u2014particularly as many seek out IMAX and other PLFs for this particular film.\n\nCONS:\n\nOppenheimer\u2018s three-hour runtime puts even more emphasis on word of mouth\u2014especially given the fact that, while containing a spectacle component, it looks to be Nolan\u2019s most strictly narrative-driven film since The Prestige in 2006.\n\nMen over the age of 25 will be the primary crowd here, and that\u2019s a source of crossover competition with Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, opening one week earlier.\n\nNolan\u2019s Tenet, released under abnormal pandemic-era circumstances, was one of the more divisive films of his career, earning a 76 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nLong Range Box Office Forecast & 2023\u2019s Upcoming Calendar\n\n(as of 6/23/23)\n\nRelease Date Title 3-Day (FSS) Opening Low/High Range Pinpoint % Chg from Last Week Domestic Total Low/High Range Pinpoint % Chg from Last Week Distributor 6/30/2023 Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny $68,000,000 \u2013 $95,000,000 -9% $211,000,000 \u2013 $325,000,000 Disney / Lucasfilm 6/30/2023 Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken $12,000,000 \u2013 $17,000,000 -10% $35,000,000 \u2013 $62,000,000 -10% Universal / DreamWorks Animation 7/7/2023 Insidious: The Red Door $24,000,000 \u2013 $29,000,000 -7% $54,000,000 \u2013 $66,000,000 -7% Sony Pictures / Screen Gems 7/7/2023 Joy Ride $11,000,000 \u2013 $16,000,000 -10% $35,000,000 \u2013 $60,000,000 -10% Lionsgate 7/12/2023 Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One $65,000,000 \u2013 $80,000,000 $250,000,000 \u2013 $320,000,000 Paramount Pictures 7/14/2023 PSYCHO-PASS: Providence (Limited) Sony / Crunchyroll 7/14/2023 Theater Camp (Limited) Disney / Searchlight Pictures 7/21/2023 Barbie $55,000,000 \u2013 $85,000,000 $120,000,000 \u2013 $226,000,000 Warner Bros.

    "text": "Is there such thing as a sympathetic cause for treason?\n\nMagnolia Pictures documentary \u201cA Compassionate Spy,\u201d directed by two-time Oscar nominee Steve James (\u201cHoop Dreams,\u201d \u201cLife Itself\u201d), captures the controversial true story of Manhattan Project physicist Ted Hall. Part of the team behind J. Robert Oppenheimer\u2019s atomic bomb, Hall shared nuclear secrets with the Soviet Union. The documentary is told through the perspective of Ted\u2019s wife Joan Hall, who protected his secret across their 50-year marriage.\n\nThe official \u201cCompassionate Spy\u201d synopsis reads: Recruited in 1944 as an 18-year-old Harvard undergraduate to help J. Robert Oppenheimer and his team create a bomb, Ted Hall was the youngest physicist on the Manhattan Project, and didn\u2019t share his colleagues\u2019 elation after the successful detonation of the world\u2019s first atomic bomb. Concerned that a U.S. post-war monopoly on such a powerful weapon could lead to nuclear catastrophe, Hall began passing key information about the bomb\u2019s construction to the Soviet Union. After the war, he met, fell in love with, and married Joan, a fellow student with whom he shared a passion for classical music and socialist causes \u2014 and the explosive secret of his espionage. The pair raised a family while living under a cloud of suspicion and years of FBI surveillance and intimidation.\n\n\u201cA Compassionate Spy\u201d premiered at the 2022 Venice Film Festival ahead of its North American launch at Telluride. The film is distributed by Magnolia Pictures and will be released on the heels of Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d which fictionalizes the creation of the bomb itself. \u201cOppenheimer\u201d will be released in theaters July 21 and used real scientists in Los Alamos as extras.\n\n\u201cWe have to be really on our game, we have to be faithful to the history here, and really know what we\u2019re up to,\u201d director Christopher Nolan explained, citing that the first explosion of the atomic bomb in the Trinity test will be shown onscreen in the upcoming film sans CGI.\n\nIndieWire\u2019s David Ehrlich wrote in the review for \u201cA Compassionate Spy\u201d that the harrowing true story is completely separate from \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Director] James doesn\u2019t have access to the same toolkit on a low-budget documentary that someone like Christopher Nolan might have at his disposal while making an $100 million biopic about Robert Oppenheimer,\u201d Ehrlich penned.\n\nHe added that \u201cA Compassionate Spy\u201d is \u201cextremely sympathetic toward Hall\u2019s choice,\u201d with director James classifying Ted Hall\u2019s as the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d when it comes to the international nuclear arms race today. Ehrlich wrote, \u201cThe rabid nationalism that might convince some modern viewers to see Hall as a villain is exactly what scared him into contacting the Soviets.\u201d\n\n\u201cA Compassionate Spy\u201d is presented by Participant and is a Mitten Media and Kartemquin Films production produced by Mark Mitten p.g.a., Dave Lindorff, and Steve James. Executive producers are Jeff Skoll, Diane Weyermann, Tim Horsburgh and Gordon Quinn.\n\n\u201cA Compassionate Spy\u201d premieres in theaters and on VOD August 4.

    "text": "UPDATE, 11:44 am PST: Christopher Nolan confirmed before the beginning of the \u201cOppenheimer\u201d screening that the cast has left in solidarity with the SAG-AFTRA strike.\n\nPREVIOUSLY: Matt Damon has revealed that the \u201cOppenheimer\u201d cast discussed their strike strategy before hitting the movie\u2019s red carpet premiere in London on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe talked about it,\u201d Damon told Variety on the carpet. \u201cLook, if it\u2019s called now, everyone\u2019s going to walk obviously in solidarity \u2026 Once the strike is officially called, [we\u2019re walking]. That\u2019s why we moved this [red carpet] up because we know the second it\u2019s called, we\u2019re going home.\u201d\n\nDamon added: \u201cWe gave the strike authorization. We voted 98% to 2% to do that because we know our leadership has our best interest at heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about working actors,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s $26,000 to qualify for health coverage and a lot of people are on the margins and residual payments are getting them across that threshold. This isn\u2019t an academic exercise. This is real life and death stuff. Hopefully we get to a resolution quickly. No one wants a work stoppage, but we\u2019ve got to get a fair deal.\u201d\n\nThe London carpet for Christopher Nolan\u2019s atomic bomb thriller kicked off just before 5 p.m. local time, with a lot of nervous publicists and marketing executives looking anxiously at their phones and watches. In the event of an early strike, sources told Variety that the entire cast planned to discreetly exit the carpet in Leicester Square.\n\nEmily Blunt told Variety: \u201cObviously we stand with all of the actors and at whatever point it\u2019s called, we\u2019re going to be going home and standing together through it because I want everyone to get a fair deal.\u201d\n\nAsked whether she\u2019ll be joining the picket line herself, the British star quipped, \u201cOh, I think so!\u201d before being rushed down the line by her publicist.\n\nKenneth Branagh, who plays physicist Niels Bohr in the film, also spoke to Variety about his feelings on the strike.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people here we did not want to disappoint, but we\u2019re also in complete solidarity with our colleagues and what they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. \u201cI know they\u2019ve worked diligently to achieve an agreement which is happening at a critical point in our industry. It\u2019s important that we\u2019re ready to be shoulder-to-shoulder with them as the situation develops.\u201d\n\nNolan also spoke to Variety on the carpet about the film\u2019s runtime, which is listed as three hours.\n\n\u201cThe runtime is two minutes shorter than \u2018Avengers: Endgame,\u2019 so we cling to that,\u201d he said. \u201cI said to [producer] Emma Thomas very early on that it\u2019s going to be a three-hour film. I have to write a script that reflects that. That was our conversation with the studio. It\u2019s a big story and needs a big talent. It\u2019s a 180-page script and it\u2019s a 180-minute movie.\u201d\n\nAsked how Nolan feels about the movie\u2019s release in Japan, which is still not confirmed, and whether he\u2019d like that country\u2019s audiences to view the film, the director said he wanted \u201cOppenheimer\u201d to have the \u201cwidest audience around the world as it can\u201d but that \u201cfilms don\u2019t come out everywhere all at the same time, so we\u2019re waiting to see what happens with the other markets.\u201d\n\nThe cast worked the carpet for the better part of an hour before wrapping around 6 p.m. for group photos. Rami Malek, who was stuck in traffic heading over to central London from a shoot, missed the red carpet entirely, but arrived at the 11th hour and hurried onto the carpet for photos.\n\nThe cast was expected to attend screenings of the film following the red carpet, but instead left the event in support of the actors strike. Universal held two separate screenings for \u201cOppenheimer\u201d \u2014 one in Leicester Square and another at BFI Imax in Waterloo (which Variety attended). Nolan attended the Leicester Square premiere first, where he revealed the cast had left in support of the strike, and then headed to the BFI venue, where he made the same speech to the audience.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story erroneously quoted Christopher Nolan saying that \u201cOppenheimer\u201d was budgeted at $180 million. The director, who was referring to the movie\u2019s runtime, said 180 minutes."

    "text": "Just as actors are congregating on the picket line in Los Angeles for the first time in more than 40 years, audiences are flocking to the cinemas to see their films in unprecedented post-pandemic numbers.\n\nTom Cruise\u2019s new film, Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One has beaten its own franchise record this week, making $15.5m on its opening day of release, including $7m in the US; a million more than the sixth instalment managed over the same time period in 2018.\n\nBy releasing early in the week, Paramount\u2019s blockbuster extends its \u201copening weekend\u201d numbers over five days \u2013 a tactic also employed by some recent James Bond films to boost numbers. Predictions suggest Mission: Impossible\u2019s final audience figures on Sunday will be around $95m in the US and $160m internationally.\n\nSuch numbers would mean the tentpole release would recoup much of its $290m budget before it\u2019s been out for a week, and mean Cruise is likely to repeat last year\u2019s trick of re-energising the Covid-battered box office. Top Gun: Maverick, his belated sequel to the 80s aviators hit, took $1.5bn in 2022 and was credited by many, including Steven Spielberg, with saving the cinematic experience.\n\nGlowing reviews and energetic marketing \u2013 focusing on why the new film\u2019s spectacular stunts are best seen on a big screen \u2013 are expected to help Cruise\u2019s latest follow suit.\n\nSuch a strong start was, however, also enjoyed by the latest Indiana Jones film, which took $60m on its opening day two weeks ago ahead of a $130m opening weekend. Yet the film then sputtered and is currently on $250m \u2013 $50m shy of its budget.\n\nYet worse returns have been clocked for Pixar\u2019s Elemental and DC superhero movie The Flash, both of which were held in high hopes by their studios.\n\nDisappointing \u2026 The Flash has underperformed. Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/Alamy\n\nThe new Mission: Impossible has a week and a half to dominate cinemas before the double-headed threat of Barbie and Oppenheimer. Both Greta Gerwig\u2019s perky comedy and Christopher Nolan\u2019s epic atomic-bomb drama are released worldwide on 21 July, and buzz around their battle has boosted pre-sales for both.\n\nCruise has professed enthusiasm rather than anxiety about the looming competition, declaring that he has bought tickets for Oppenheimer next Friday and Barbie the following day.\n\nAMC cinemas in the US said that at least 20,000 of its members had booked to see both films on the same day, and many exhibitors globally are promoting the concept of this unlikely double bill.\n\nEven without such smart marketing, both Barbie and Oppenheimer are being sold as \u201cevent cinema\u201d. Barbie is billed as best seen en masse and, perhaps, after having visited the cinema\u2019s licensed concession stand.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Film Weekly Free newsletter Take a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Tristan Fewings/Getty Images for Warner Bros.\n\nOppenheimer, meanwhile, was shot on Imax, and as with many of Nolan\u2019s films, audiences are strongly encouraged to see it on Imax screens \u2013 or, at least, the very largest possible. The film\u2019s un-family friendly subject matter, as well as its R-rating in the US, may however limit its final takings. Tracking for Oppenheimer\u2019s opening weekend currently stands as $43m in the US while Barbie\u2019s is more than double, at $93m.\n\nBookmakers William Hill said on Friday that Barbie was 3/1 to become the highest-grossing film the year, with only The Super Mario Bros Movie (1/4) ahead of it in the betting.\n\nMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One was 10/1 with forthcoming superhero movie The Marvels down to 14/1.\n\nTom Cruise\u2019s Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part 1 is also amongst the frontrunners at 10/1, with The Marvels (14/1) likewise in the reckoning. Dark horse Wonka came in at 33/1: the first trailer for Paul (Paddington) King\u2019s origins story about Willy Wonka starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet was warmly received earlier this week.\n\nReviews for Barbie are embargoed until midnight BST on 18 July, with Oppenheimer at 5pm the following day."

And Oppenheimer.\n\nDespite his own blockbuster opening in a few weeks (that would be Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning, Part One), Cruise is urging his fans to check out the summer movie competition.\n\n\u201cThis summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters,\u201d Cruise wrote on Instagram post (below) that showed him standing with his Dead Reckoning writer-director Christopher McQuarrie in front of posters for Indy 5. \u201cThese are just a few that we can\u2019t wait to see on the big screen.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongratulations, Harrison Ford, on 40 years of Indiana Jones and creating one of the most iconic characters in cinema history,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou have given us countless hours of joy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love a double feature, and it doesn\u2019t get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie.\u201d\n\nThe messaging suggests Cruise is once again hoping to save the summer box office \u2014 this time by bringing along a few other titles.\n\nLast year, the massive success of Top Gun: Maverick (which made $1.5 billion globally) was credited as \u201csaving Hollywood\u2019s ass\u201d by no less than Steven Spielberg himself.\n\nThis year, a few films have struggled to gain box office traction \u2014 such as The Flash and Elemental \u2014 though Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse successfully popped.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is facing headwinds with modest reviews, yet is tracking to open with a solid $60 million to $70 million over the June 30-July 2 weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, Dead Reckoning is headed toward a franchise-best $90 million opening for its extended weekend, which gets underway Wednesday, July 12.\n\nThere\u2019s no tracking yet for Barbie or Oppenheimer, which open head-to-head July 21, but both are considered highly anticipated \u2014 though, with respect to Cruise, would likely make for a rather odd back-to-back viewing experience.\n\nThe move follows a viral report from Puck that a \u201cpissed\u201d Cruise was had loudly complained to Paramount executives about the impact of Oppenheimer\u2019s IMAX deal. Cruise was reportedly upset that IMAX was going to boot Dead Reckoning from its large-format screens after just one week in order to make room for its prior commitment to run Oppenheimer \u2014 which was entirely shot in the IMAX format \u2013 for three weeks.\n\n\u2014 Pamela McClintock contributed to this report"

Nolan then had the idea to cast Flora in a then-open role: a nameless young woman who has her face damaged by a nuclear explosion in a sequence within the main character\u2019s mind.\n\n\u201cWe needed someone to do that small part of a somewhat experimental and spontaneous sequence,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cSo it was wonderful to just have her sort of roll with it.\u201d\n\nNolan recognized the peculiarity of the casting, revealing that it was a decision that came quickly and one that was not premeditated: \u201cTruthfully, I try not to analyze my own intentions.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the casting further illustrates the theme of \u201cOppenheimer\u201d at large: \u201cBut the point is that if you create the ultimate destructive power it will also destroy those who are near and dear to you. I suppose this was my way of expressing that in what, to me, were the strongest possible terms.\u201d\n\nNolan also joked that the casting somewhat resembled a role in Michael Powell\u2019s 1960 horror classic \u201cPeeping Tom,\u201d in which the English director cast his young son as the childhood version of a serial killer.\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d explores the creation of the atomic bomb during World War II, an effort spearheaded by J. Robert Oppenheimer and the U.S. military. The epic-length feature sports an all-star cast including Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Robert Downey Jr., amongst others. Universal Pictures is releasing the film to theaters on July 21."

So we will see what happens. Right now it's the joy to be together.\"\n\nThe Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA)'s president Fran Drescher announced in an impassioned speech during a press conference in Los Angeles on Thursday that the union will go on strike.\n\nThe strike went into effect at midnight PT Thursday night.\n\n\"Oppenheimer\" is scheduled to premiere in theaters on July 21.\n\nThe CNN Wire \u2122 & \u00a9 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

    "text": "In the battle to become the political heavyweight movie of the summer, one movie has already emerged triumphant \u2014 and it\u2019s not the one about the building of the atomic bomb. Following the, let\u2019s be honest, stunning news that Vietnam has banned the movie and reports that the Philippines might do the same, Greta Gerwig\u2019s upcoming Barbie has firmly established itself as the dominant political touchstone of the season.\n\nYes, really.\n\nVietnam\u2019s decision to ban commercial screenings of the Warner Bros. movie \u2014 which were set to begin July 21 \u2014 is, according to a statement given by the country\u2019s Department of Cinema to the Washington Post, due to the appearance of a map in the movie that appears to depict China\u2019s disputed territorial claims in the South China Sea \u2014 a claim also made by a number of other countries, notably including Vietnam and the Philippines.\n\nIn a statement explaining the banning of the movie, Vi Kien Thanh, head of the Department of Cinema, said that the movie featured an \u201coffensive scene that shows the cow tongue line,\u201d which would appear to be a reference to the so-called \u201cnine-dash line,\u201d the name given to China\u2019s visual depiction of the disputed territory.\n\nThe scene has proven to be similarly controversial in the Philippines, with multiple local politicians weighing in on the topic. \u201cIf the invalidated nine-dash line was indeed depicted in the movie Barbie, then it is incumbent upon the [Movie and Television Review and Classification Board] to ban the same as it denigrates Philippine sovereignty,\u201d Senator Francis Tolentino told CNN. \u201cThe movie is fiction, and so is the nine-dash line,\u201d argued Senator Risa Hontiveros in her own video statement, adding, \u201cAt the minimum, our cinemas should include an explicit disclaimer that the nine-dash line is a figment of China\u2019s imagination.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the movie was permitted for release in the Phillipines, with the controversial map reportedly being blurred to obscure the map.\n\nSo far, Warner Bros. has yet to comment on the matter.\n\nBarbie isn't the first unexpected movie to get into hot water over the nine-dash line; both Sony's 2022 video game adaptation Uncharted and DreamWorks' 2019 animated kids movie Abominable faced similar bans, while the 2018 comedy Crazy Rich Asians cut a brief glimpse of a map to avoid the same fate.\n\nSomewhere, Robert Oppenheimer is smiling, if somewhat confused that Barbie, of all things, is causing all this trouble.\n\nBarbie will be released July 21. Buy tickets on Fandango or Atom Tickets.\n\nOppenheimer might have lost the political battle, but will it win the watching war? Have your say in our poll right here."

    "text": "Director Christopher Nolan\u2019s latest feature Oppenheimer takes us into the tremendous yet troubled mind of physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), exploring the events of his life and the crucial role he played in the development of the atomic bomb. Always standing by his side throughout every battle (whether that be at the Los Alamos facility or at a tense hearing) is wife Kitty, played by the ever brilliant Emily Blunt.\n\nThe fierce Kitty Oppenheimer isn\u2019t there to hold her husband\u2019s hand. Instead, she is the driving force. Kitty repeatedly uses the word \"fight\" in her conversations with Oppenheimer, continually urging him to push forward in not only his work on the Manhattan Project, but in his later clashes with politicians. \"Why won\u2019t you fight?\" Blunt\u2019s Kitty firmly asks, not through exasperation but instead passion, being Oppenheimer\u2019s biggest champion. She isn\u2019t exactly frustrated by Oppenheimer\u2019s sometimes unwillingness to stand up for himself, Kitty detests the way the world is treating her husband, and what that is turning him into.\n\nFor Blunt, this is what is behind Kitty\u2019s tenacity here, as she explained to GamesRadar+: \"I think she believes in him and in his intentions, and I think she loathes seeing him dragged across the coals for their whole life, which is for public consumption. She believes that it is wrong and she knows who is the villain behind it, she has this surety about her whilst he is passive. That definitely incentivises her to push him further because he seems to be taking it as if he\u2019s atoning for the sins of what he\u2019s done and created. It\u2019s really that she\u2019s firing against his passive nature.\"\n\n(Image credit: Universal)\n\nIn fact, one of the highlights of the film sees Kitty fight against the politicians with all that she has during Oppenheimer\u2019s hearing, essentially giving them a piece of her mind. She\u2019s certainly a fierce character, but beneath that are vulnerabilities as we see Kitty struggle with the likes of addiction and motherhood, complexities Blunt explores beautifully. The actor is surprised then when we mention that Nolan has often drawn criticism for his female characters, with these commentators often citing the dead wives of his filmography and suggesting that the women are regularly sidelined.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the best parts that anyone has ever written for me\n\nResponding with her thoughts on this, Blunt emphasises how Kitty is one of the best roles she has ever played: \"I mean - it\u2019s one of the best parts that anyone has ever written for me. Not that he wrote it for me, but he wrote an exquisite part that is so layered. Even though she\u2019s not a huge part, it packs a punch. I was so excited by her. And the thing that I love is that he wasn\u2019t concerned with her being likeable, it was just a very real interpretation of the character. When you read about her in the book, they say that 'Kitty didn\u2019t do small talk she only did big talk' which is so symbolic of the character. I really remember reading that and thinking, \u2018that\u2019s it, she\u2019s so clear\u2019. Usually I think women in movies have to be sort of quite likeable and warm, but she wasn\u2019t either of those things, and he was unafraid of that and writing her as such. I just loved her.\"\n\nWill the part of Kitty Oppenheimer change the minds of Nolan's naysayers? Well, only time will tell, but one thing is certain - this Kitty has claws.\n\nOppenheimer releases in UK and US cinemas on July 21. For more on the film, you can read our interviews with director Christopher Nolan and actor Matt Damon, and listen to the latest episode of the Inside Total Film podcast for our chat with Cillian Murphy and more Nolan.\n\nIn the meantime, check out our guide to the rest of the most exciting upcoming movies in 2023 and beyond."

    "text": "\u201cOppenheimer\u201d is the biopic only Christopher Nolan could make, a three-hour experience with the ability to hold your gaze \u2014 and your full attention \u2014 while the fury of its sound rattles the theater auditorium in which you sit.\n\nThe director of \u201cDunkirk,\u201d \u201cInception,\u201d \u201cTenet\u201d and several other noteworthy films, Nolan is both the director and writer of the film, adapting it from Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin\u2019s 2005 Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, \u201cAmerican Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer.\u201d\n\nHe offers a deep dive into the psyche of the theoretical physicist who led the U.S. government\u2019s Manhattan Project during World War II and became known as \u201cthe father of the atomic bomb,\u201d an examination that at times is served with near-nuclear force.\n\nIt is incredible.\n\nCillian Murphy \u2014 who has appeared in numerous Nolan films, including \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d Trilogy, but has never been front and center \u2014 portrays the titular figure with a steady and subtle touch. It is not a performance characterized by big, emotional speeches but instead by myriad science-based conversations, many regarding the physical fate of the world.\n\nThere exists, Oppenheimer comes to learn, a \u201cnear-zero\u201d chance the detonation of an atomic will ignite the atmosphere, ending all life on Earth.\n\nNolan is most interested in the conflict Oppenheimer feels, more strongly at times than others, about achieving a great scientific breakthrough but one with the power to take so much life even in the event all goes as designed. A Jewish man, he mainly sells himself on the idea that the U.S. must beat Nazi Germany to the development of a weapon of such mass destruction.\n\nEven at 180 minutes, \u201cOppenheimer\u201d has no time for its subject\u2019s childhood, instead taking us on a largely but certainly not wholly linear journey \u2014 this is Nolan, after all \u2014 from the early part of Oppenheimer\u2019s career to the scientist\u2019s controversial years that followed the detonation by the U.S. of atomic bombs over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nNolan introduces us to numerous figures from Oppenheimer\u2019s work and personal lives, and you\u2019ll likely struggle to keep track of them all.\n\nThere are the scientists \u2014 mainly men, portrayed by, among others, Josh Harnett, Rami Malek, Kenneth Branagh, Benny Safdie, David Krumholtz, Jack Quaid, Danny Deferrari and Tom Conti, as Albert Einstein \u2014 along with the military man who hires and subsequently oversees Oppenheimer, Leslie Graves (a predictably enjoyable Matt Damon), and Boris Pash (Casey Affleck), an Army counter-intelligence operative watching for security concerns tied to Oppenheimer.\n\nThere also are a couple of key women, psychiatrist Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), with whom he has recurring relations, and his wife, the frequently drinking biologist and botanist Kitty Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt). (Until fairly deep into the film, Nolan makes too little use of \u201cA Quiet Place Part II\u201d costars Blunt and Murphy together.) Both of them fuel concerns Oppenheimer has significant ties to Communism, as does his brother, Frank (Dylan Arnold).\n\nA film also needs its villain, this one\u2019s proving to be Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s Lewis Strauss, a founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. The final of the three acts of \u201cOppenheimer\u201d dramatizes parallel proceedings in which Oppenheimer and Strauss essentially are put on trial. It\u2019s compelling fare but not as compelling as what precedes it, despite fine work from Downey (\u201cChaplin\u201d).\n\nBurning at surprisingly breakneck speed for a movie this long, dense and without at least conventional action sequences, \u201cOppenheimer\u201d builds to a crescendo at the end of the second act with the re-creation of the famed Trinity test, the detonation of a bomb in the New Mexico desert close to the Manhattan Project\u2019s top-secret Los Alamos base. According to the production information, Nolan told his effects team no digital imagery could be used, and the sequence\u2019s visuals are highly impactful as a result.\n\nShot largely in New Mexico, \u201cOppenheimer\u201d possesses a distinct look overall, captured by director of photography Hoyte Van Hoytema (\u201cDunkirk,\u201d \u201cTenet\u201d) on, as the aforementioned production info states, \u201ca combination of IMAX 65mm and 65mm large-format film photography including, for the first time ever, sections in IMAX black and white analogue photography.\u201d\n\nTruly, though, the reason to see the film in an IMAX auditorium may not be its larger-than-typical screen but instead its accompanying extra-thunderous sound system. \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is consistently visceral from an audio perspective, thanks not only to the effects \u2014 the use of sound during the Trinity scene is next-level \u2014 but to the score by Ludwig Goransson (\u201cTenet,\u201d \u201cBlack Panther\u201d). Seemingly designed to never allow the viewer to relax, the affecting music is at times at odds with the dialogue, but not as often as in some previous Nolan efforts.\n\nThere is one more behind-the-scenes contributor whose work simply must be acknowledged: editor Jennifer Lame (\u201cBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever,\u201d \u201cTenet\u201d). \u201cOppenheimer\u201d moves so fluidly from scene to scene to scene that the stitching alone is astounding.\n\nWhile, yes, a biopic \u2014 we certainly understand Nolan\u2019s treatise on J. Robert Oppenheimer by the conclusion \u2014 the auteur ultimately was interested in crafting a cautionary tale, one that reminds us the possibility of the rather rapid destruction of our world is an ever-present possibility. It may not succeed in achieving our biggest ask \u2014 giving us something new about which to ponder \u2014 but it is plenty powerful all the same.\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d is rated R for some sexuality, nudity and language. Runtime: 3 hours."

It just had a big impact on me. It broke my heart. I love watching his films when I\u2019m not in them because you don\u2019t have to freak out about the size of your ears, or whatever.\u201d\n\nMurphy stressed that Nolan cast the \u201cright people\u201d in \u201cInterstellar,\u201d so there\u2019s no hard feelings that he missed out on it. The epic stars Matthew McConaughey as an ex-NASA pilot who is recruited on a mission to locate a new planet outside of the solar system that can support human life. Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, Matt Damon and Michael Caine had supporting roles in the film.\n\nThe Independent also asked Murphy which Nolan movie he\u2019d pair with \u201cOppenheimer\u201d for a double feature.\n\n\u201cYou could go \u2018Interstellar,\u2019 which is very\u2026 explores similar scientific, physic themes. Or you could watch \u2018Dunkirk,\u2019 which is also set in World War II,\u201d Murphy said. \u201c\u2018Dunkirk\u2019 is shorter, so that might be a good match \u2018cause it\u2019s like an hour-and-a-half, and then you can go into [\u2018Oppenheimer\u2019].\u201d\n\nDespite being a talky biographical drama that runs three hours and is rated R, \u201cOppenheimer\u201d has already surpassed the lifetime domestic box office totals of \u201cInterstellar\u201d and \u201cDunkirk.\u201d The film has earned $264 million in the U.S. and Canada, while its global gross is about to cross the $650 million mark. \u201cOppenheimer\u201d is now playing in theaters nationwide."

    "text": "After starring in the critically acclaimed Oppenheimer and Peaky Blinders, many fans are wondering who are Cillian Murphy\u2019s kids and why does he keep his private life hidden?\n\nCillian Murphy married Yvonne McGuinness in 2004 after they met in 1996 at one of his rock shows. They have two boys, Malachy and Aram, who they raise in Ireland. \u201cWe wanted them to be Irish, I suppose,\u201d Murphy pointed out to The Guardian. It\u2019s amazing how quickly their accents have adapted. Even within a year of moving back, they are fading into this rakish west Brit kind of thing. Which I think, hopefully, will get them lots of girls when they\u2019re 15.\u201d\n\nMurphy elaborated on the move to Deadline and why he\u2019s not close to the movie industry based in Los Angeles. \u201cWe did live in London for 14 years, it was a big chunk of my life from my mid 20s to my late 30s. I really enjoyed it, it was really exciting, it\u2019s a great city, but the move to Dublin wasn\u2019t motivated by wanting to distance myself from the industry. I was purely motivated by wanting to come home to Ireland and raise our kids as Irish and be near our families.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI think the world we live in now, you\u2019re proof of it as well, you can do your work remotely and the work will come to you. I don\u2019t believe that you have to live in Los Angeles or New York or London to make good work; it means you have to travel a little more, but it hasn\u2019t affected my work or professional life in any way. It just means that when I stop working, I\u2019m not surrounded by it and that to me is healthy.\u201d\n\nHe reflected about his time as a teenager and raising two teenage boys now. \u201cI had bravado. But, deep down\u2026 I don\u2019t know, they seem better adjusted than I was. More sure of themselves. I\u2019m happy about that. For me, it was something that took a long time to figure out: that it\u2019s all right to be you, that it\u2019s all right to be an individual.\u201d\n\nLiving in Ireland, the family does not have internet in their homes. \u201cI\u2019m a father of two teenagers, I once was young. I recognise how tricky it is for a young person today in society,\u201d the Inception actor confided. \u201cIt is a very complex time growing up, things are changing a lot at a very accelerated rate. We\u2019re all aware of the effect of the internet online and life online,\u201d he told Mirror UK.\n\n\u201cIt feels to me like lots of kids, like their life exists inside of this device. The idea that empathy would form part of a curriculum is an excellent idea. Young people are caring and compassionate and willing to be.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s no Internet where they\u2019re at what do they do? Well watch movies, of course! In an interview with Letterboxd during the Oppenheimer press tour, the Dark Knight actor said that he watched La Haine, Apocalypse Now, The Big Lebowski, and Midnight Cowboy. Though in an interview with The Standard in 2017, he said his work doesn\u2019t fit in with his kids. \u201cMost of what I do is highly unsuitable for them,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cThey\u2019re suitably underwhelmed by my work. I\u2019m trying to keep them in that state because it\u2019s such a silly industry.\u201d\n\nSo who are Cillian Murphy\u2019s kids? Read more to find out.\n\nMalachy Murphy (born 2005)\n\nCillian Murphy and Yvonne McGuinness Raymond Hall/GC Images\n\nMalachy Murphy is Cillian Murphy and Yvonne McGuinness\u2019 first child. He was born in 2005, one year after they got married. Not much is known about him, but McGuinness was pregnant with Malachy when Murphy was filming The Wind That Blows The Barley. He told The Guardian, \u201cI was living at home with my folks; my wife was pregnant with our son; and we were running around the hills of west Cork shooting up Black and Tans. Fantastic!\u201d\n\nWhen filming Peaky Blinders, Murphy talked about how his family kept him grounded when he returned home. \u201cIt\u2019s cancelled life,\u201d he explained to The Guardian. \u201cYou go home to your tiny apartment at the end of the day and you feed yourself for sustenance and you learn the lines for the next day and you try to get as much sleep as you possibly can. Which isn\u2019t much. And then you get up and do it again. It takes time. My wife can see it happening. \u2018OK. Tommy\u2019s gradually leaving. I\u2019m getting Cillian back.\u201d\n\nAran Murphy (born 2007)\n\nAran Murphy is Cillian Murphy and Yvonne Guinness\u2019s second child and son. Aran followed the footsteps of his father and became an actor. In 2019, Aran performed in a one-person play Hamnet based on the son of Shakespeare and the Brooklyn Academy of Music in Brooklyn, New York. The show garnered praised by the New York Times where they called Murphy a \u201cblossomed\u201d actor.\n\nMurphy praised his son\u2019s abilities two years later with The Guardian. \u201cHe was so chilled about it, you know? He would come off stage and ask what the score was in the Liverpool game. And, again, you\u2019re slightly jealous of that!\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThere\u2019s the danger that overanalyzing everything can erode the simplicity.\u201d\n\nThe Peaky Blinders actor also put firm boundaries on his social and work life. \u201cThat work-life balance thing is hard. I have an amazing wife and I couldn\u2019t do this without her and her understanding. But it is a struggle.\u201c He continued: \u201cI think it is for any dad whose work takes him away, which it generally does, and which consumes him, which my work does.\u201c\n\nOur mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you\u2019ll love as much as we do.

It follows two teenagers, Darren/Pig (Cillian Murphy) and Sin\u00e9ad/Runt (Elaine Cassidy), whose incredibly close friendship quickly develops into something much deeper around their 17th birthday.\n\nWhile the tragic movie wasn't hugely loved by critics, audiences loved the intensity that Murphy brought to the role, and the movie has a 75% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nJust one year later, in 2002, Danny Boyle's \"28 Days Later\" arrived in theaters with its blistering new take on zombies and a modern apocalypse. It has equally high audience and critics' scores on Rotten Tomatoes, and for good reason.\n\nThe film hinges on Murphy's survivor, Jim, who wakes up in an abandoned hospital after the outbreak of a deadly virus that has led to rage-induced characteristics among the remaining population."

    "text": "Oppenheimer Day 3 earnings: Christopher Nolan-directed biographical drama Oppenheimer is going strength to strength at the Indian box office. The film is inching closer to the Rs 50 crore mark within the first three days of its release. Oppenheimer collected Rs 14.50 crore on its first Friday, Rs 17.25 crore on its first Saturday and around Rs 17.25 crore on its first Sunday, as per early estimates.\n\nWith this, the film is estimated to have raked in around Rs 49 crore in India during its first weekend, as per trade portal Sacnilk. The film had an overall occupancy of 56.66 per cent in English shows and 26.46 per cent in Hindi shows on Sunday.\n\nOppenheimer has had quite the run at the global box office as well. The biographical drama made nearly $80.5 million in North America and $93.7 million in other international markets, as per film trade analyst Sumit Kadel. The film\u2019s total worldwide box office collections have hit $174.2 million as of Sunday.\n\nBarbie & Oppenheimer records EXPLOSIVE First weekend collection Worldwide !! #Barbie\n\nNorth America- $155M\n\nInternational - $182M\n\nWorldwide - $337M\n\nIndia Biz - \u20b9 18.50 cr Nett | 21.50 cr Gross. #Oppenheimer\n\nNorth America - $80.5M\n\nInternational - $93.7M\n\nWorldwide - $174.2M\u2026 pic.twitter.com/qG4IOpUvZ5 \u2014 Sumit Kadel (@SumitkadeI) July 23, 2023\n\nMeanwhile, Christopher Nolan recommended watching Oppenheimer in IMAX. The film was shot entirely on Imax 65 mm and Panavision 65 mm film. This is unusual as Imax cameras are usually used for big action shots whereas more convenient cameras are used for other shots. Only 19 theatres in the US and 30 globally are showing the film in this format at present.\n\nImax refers to a standard for high-resolution cameras, film formats, projectors and cinemas. Imax movie screens are known for tall aspect ratios usually 1.43:1 or 1.90:1. These screens also have a steep stadium seating in the theatre, leading to better audio experience.\n\nOppenheimer focuses on the life of J Robert Oppenheimer, also known as the \u2018father of the atomic bomb\u2019. Oppenheimer was pivotal in developing the first nuclear weapons as part of the Manhattan Project. Manhattan Project was a research and development undertaking led by the US with support from the UK and Canada during World War II aimed at producing the first nuclear weapons.\n\nBacked by Universal Pictures, the film stars Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek, Kenneth Branagh and Gary Oldman in significant roles.

    "text": "Cillian Murphy calls Tom Hardy \u201cone of the best actors in the business\u201d\n\nActor Cillian Murphy is all the rage at the moment. After several successful years playing Tommy Shelby in Peaky Blinders and a number of acclaimed feature films, Murphy has launched a significant appeal for an Academy Award, playing the lead role in Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer.\n\nHowever, Murphy is keen to deflect the many plaudits coming his way onto some of his contemporary actors, including another Nolan collaborator, Tom Hardy, who famously played the villain Bane in The Dark Knight Rises.\n\nIn a new interview with GQ, Murphy said, \u201cHe\u2019s one of the best actors in the business. And we\u2019ve developed this great trust and shorthand, and there\u2019s a nice kind of chemistry, I think, between the two of us.\u201d\n\nAs to whether Murphy has any plans to work with Hardy again, he added, \u201cI\u2019d love to work with him again. Maybe there\u2019ll be a Peaky Blinders film. Maybe we\u2019ll get to do it there. I\u2019m not sure.\u201d\n\nHowever, Murphy was coy on whether a Peaky Blinders film was actually moving into realisation. \u201cI have no update for you, man,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m waiting to hear, but it\u2019s a tricky time with all these strikes and everything going on. I\u2019ve always said that if there\u2019s more story to tell, I\u2019d be there.\u201d\n\nTom Hardy played the character Alfie Solomons in Peaky Blinders alongside Murphy, joining the Birmingham-based crime series in the second season.\n\nCheck out a clip of Hardy performing in the series below."

    "text": "We won\u2019t pretend to speak for Cillian Murphy (though that is currently one of the few options at our disposal), but the Irish actor may well see some upsides to the sudden moratorium on promotional duties.\n\nChristopher Nolan was in Leicester Square nine days ago to introduce the premiere of his much-anticipated Oppenheimer. Murphy, who plays J Robert Oppenheimer, the \u201cfather of the atomic bomb\u201d, in the sprawling epic, was conspicuous by his sudden absence. Co-stars Robert Downey jnr, Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt were equally elsewhere.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen them here earlier on the red carpet,\u201d Nolan explained. \u201cUnfortunately, they are off to write their picket signs for what we believe to be an imminent strike by SAG, joining one of my guilds, the Writers Guild, in the struggle for fair wages for working members of their union.\u201d\n\nNo doubt Murphy would have been happy to help out. But, over the last 25 years, he has been uneasy about the promotional business. He was in the acting game for over a decade before appearing on his first chatshow. He is not the only actor to recoil from opening up to strangers on red carpets, but he remains more forceful in his reluctance than most.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n\u201cMy job is to portray other people,\u201d he told me in 2021. \u201cThe less that people know about me the better I can portray other people. That seems glaringly obvious and logical to me.\u201d\n\nThe cone of silence lowers as Murphy reaches a new high in a notable career. Following early stage success with Corcadorca in his native Cork, he secured his first significant film role in Danny Boyle\u2019s bone-rattling horror 28 Days Later from 2002. He became a regular in the Nolan stock company with performances in that director\u2019s Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and Inception.\n\nHe was placed at the centre of the hugely popular TV show Peaky Blinders. But none of this brings the same level of attention as playing the title role in a $100 million biopic. To this point, Murphy has come across as a character actor \u2013 extremely good-looking, but not in a way Hollywood expects \u2013 who has found himself taking lead roles. He is a dab hand at oddballs. And there are few balls odder than Oppenheimer.\n\n[ Oppenheimer review: Cillian Murphy gives a commanding turn. But why is Florence Pugh reduced to Crazy Naked Chick? ]\n\n[ Oppenheimer reviews: what do the critics say about Christopher Nolan\u2019s drama? ]\n\nTaking inspiration from Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin\u2019s book American Prometheus, the film gives Murphy free rein to explore the physicist\u2019s eccentricities. He famously left a poisoned apple (uneaten, thank goodness) for his tutor when at Cambridge. We are left with a genius believably tortured by the decisions other people made following, in the summer of 1945, the first successful detonation of an A-bomb. There is weirdness and vulnerability in there. Those are characteristics Murphy has traded in since he shifted towards acting at the end of the last century.\n\nIf you know anything about Cillian Murphy\u2019s early life you probably know that rock music\u2019s loss was the theatre\u2019s gain. Raised in Ballintemple, he is the child of educators. Mum was a French teacher. Dad worked for the Department of Education. He \u201cdid well in the Leaving\u201d and made his way, with measured enthusiasm, to study law at UCC.\n\nCillian Murphy (right) in the 2001 film version of Disco Pigs\n\nMeanwhile, he and his pals had been creating complex, wacky tunes with their band The Sons of Mr Green Genes (named for, of all unfashionable things, a song from Frank Zappa\u2019s Hot Rats). There is another part of the metaverse in which Murphy has, now a rock veteran, just completed a third successive Saturday-night slot on the Second Stage at Glastonbury. He has the cheekbones for a rock star. Those famous, piercing blue eyes could generate a cult on their own.\n\nThe band allegedly secured a decent offer from a British label. Back in 2012, I asked him if he ever mourned the road not taken.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when I felt that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now I am more confident. I always knew there was a ceiling that I had as a musician, and I feel that was reached pretty quickly. But with acting I feel like I have more to prove. Also, the music industry has changed. It\u2019s so hard to make money.\u201d\n\nMurphy will, no doubt, regret that, less than a year before the release of Oppenheimer, Corcadorca, the great independent theatre company that gave him his break, closed its doors for good. The legend goes he saw the company performing an adaptation of A Clockwork Orange and knew instantly that is where he wanted to be. His first lead role came opposite Eileen Walsh in Enda Walsh\u2019s Disco Pigs. Following a pair of off-beam teenagers as they ramble through \u201cPork City\u201d, the 1996 production was a sensation and eventually became a film directed by Kirsten Sheridan.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows Disco Pigs changed everything for me,\u201d he told Peter Crawley for this newspaper on the play\u2019s 20th anniversary. \u201cIt was the first thing I ever did, and it formed me totally. It\u2019s hard not to be nostalgic about these things. But it really was a brilliant time for me. It was the confidence of youth \u2013 or the ignorance of youth. Maybe a combination of both. Trying to get to that level again was a struggle.\u201d\n\nThere has been amusing discussion about Murphy\u2019s physical suitability for the role of Oppenheimer. Surely he is too young to play the gaunt, furrowed scientist at the point of his great triumph. In fact, the actor, at 47, is a full seven years older than Oppenheimer at the time of the Trinity test. The slim, sapphire-eyed youth who emerged from Disco Pigs and went on to flee zombies in 28 Days Later seems oddly unchanged by the passing decades. Mind you, Tom Cruise, 15 years his senior, can boast the same.\n\nIn 2002, when 28 Days Later opened, the nation was still mildly surprised to find an Irish actor at the heart of a major motion picture. Colin Farrell, born in the same year as Murphy, was up there in Minority Report, but who could have guessed, after early inconveniences, the Dubliner would play the game so skilfully and prosper into his forties. Saoirse Ronan was five years away from her Oscar nomination for Atonement. Michael Fassbender was taking small roles in Band of Brothers and NCS: Manhunt. Paul Mescal was seven years old. The current Irish bossing of Hollywood was a long way off.\n\nCIllian Murphy as J Robert Oppenheimer\n\nWhether consciously or not, Murphy found himself keeping the career on a steady simmer over the succeeding 20 years. He had stage success. Reviewing his 2002 turn in Neil LaBute\u2019s The Shape of Things at the Gate for this paper, Fintan O\u2019Toole remarked: \u201cMurphy measures out his metamorphosis with an impressive subtlety and intelligence.\u201d Nolan caught the appeal early on and cast him as The Scarecrow in Batman Begins from 2005. He returned to the role for The Dark Knight. Neil Jordan allowed Murphy his biggest challenge yet when he cast him as a transgender Northerner in an adaptation of Pat McCabe\u2019s Breakfast on Pluto in 2005 (a decision that might cause some furrowing of brows today). The role was typical of an actor steering away from the tempting perils of mainstream blockbusters to seek thornier challenges.\n\nThe apparent stability of his home life reinforced that sense of a safe ship being piloted steadily forward. The word \u201capparent\u201d is there to press home his continuing resistance to prying or probing. You couldn\u2019t quite call him an enigma. He does not \u2013 so far as we are aware \u2013 spend his summers among any sinister cults. He has no expensively vulgar movie-star hobbies. In 2004, he married Yvonne McGuinness, an artist whom he met in his budding rock star days, and began the raising of two sons in London before moving them all back to Dublin in 2015.\n\n\u201cWell, I suppose to be closer to family,\u201d he told me in 2021. \u201cThe kids are of a certain age. I think if you live in a world capital \u2013 like New York or London or wherever \u2013 it\u2019s excellent and exciting and stimulating in your 20s and 30s. Then there\u2019s a point where the things that were excellent and stimulating are now a bit sort of tedious and draining. You want something quieter and that\u2019s what we did.\u201d\n\nSuch is the nature of Oppenheimer \u2013 a huge biopic from a prestige director \u2013 there would be talk of an Oscar nomination if Murphy were merely adequate in the role. As it transpires, he owns the film\n\nYet for all the assertions of normality, there remains a mystery \u2013 if not quite that enigma \u2013 about what Cillian Murphy does on screen. There always seems to be something held strategically back. There is a tension within him that hints at impending explosion. That unease helped Ken Loach\u2019s The Wind that Shakes the Barley, in which he played a rebel in the War of Independence, to the Palme d\u2019Or at the 2006 Cannes film festival.\n\nThere is a campaigning side to his personality. Last year, Ionbh\u00e1: The Empathy Book for Ireland, a collection of essays and poems he edited to support the \u201cActivating Social Empathy\u201d education programme, was published by Mercier Press. \u201cThe book was something that we had been talking about for ages, just to try and get this idea of empathy into the common vernacular/vocabulary,\u201d he said following the book\u2019s release. He supported the 2007 Rock the Vote campaign. He is a patron of the Unesco Child and Family Research Centre at the University of Galway. Murphy may not enjoy putting himself before interrogators, but he does allow whispers of the inner man to emerge.\n\nAnd yet. Looking back through his interviews, again and again you get the sense of a man who wants the wider world to know him only through his work. More Paul Schofield than Oliver Reed. More Scott Walker than Sean Ryder.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no baggage,\u201d he told me over a decade ago. \u201cThey haven\u2019t seen you being funny on a talkshow. They just get the character. I could never be funny on a talkshow. ... I am not that sort of person. I know what I am good at, and being funny on a talkshow is not what I am at.\u201d\n\nNobody knows how long the strike will last. Fran Drescher, the admirable president of actors\u2019 union SAG-AFTRA, sounded determined in her rousing speeches last week. Brian Cox is among those who feels the dispute, largely concerning residuals on streaming services and the threat of artificial intelligence, could drag on until the end of the year. There is, thus, a decent chance that Murphy could avoid that one turn in luckier actors\u2019 lives when there is near-irresistible pressure to be \u201cfunny on a talkshow\u201d.\n\nSuch is the nature of Oppenheimer \u2013 a huge biopic from a prestige director \u2013 there would be talk of an Oscar nomination if Murphy were merely adequate in the role. As it transpires, he owns the film, finding a scratchy intensity that communicates the momentousness of the subject\u2019s commission. He gets to deliver Oppenheimer\u2019s famous line twice and twice masters every vowel and consonant. \u201cNow I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,\u201d the scientist said, quoting the Bhagavad-gita. Murphy gets to coil up tensely when the authorities come for him during the McCarthyite witch-hunts. He has moments of qualified elation.\n\nIt would be astonishing if his name were not there when the nominations are announced on January 24th. Most contenders have yet to screen. Maybe Joaquin Phoenix could be there for Ridley Scott\u2019s Napoleon. Adam Driver might make some noise in Michael Mann\u2019s Ferrari. Away from biopics, Paul Giamatti looks possible in Alexander Payne\u2019s The Holdovers. But Murphy is currently the one holding all the cards.\n\nIn any normal year, the horrors of \u201cawards season\u201d would loom. Remember how, last time, the gallant Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell, ultimately both nominated for The Banshees of Inisherin, launched a double-act at the Venice Film Festival in September that played every talkshow for the succeeding six months.\n\nMurphy will be expected to do silly video things, more serious print profiles and cheery stints on food shows. He will be expected to accept largely made-up Turny Awards \u2013 given to celebs who turn-up \u2013 at events in desert retreats and mountaintop ski resorts. Even the most gregarious find their will to live sapped. Obviously, as a sound Cork man, he will want the strike settled quickly and wish his colleagues back to work. But he could be forgiven for savouring a few months\u2019 peace.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no trick to it,\u201d he once told me, pondering the privacy he maintains. \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem if you live a reasonably normal life and don\u2019t go to events that are not obligatory.\u201d\n\nGood luck with that.\n\nOppenheimer is in cinemas\n\nTen milestones in Cillian Murphy\u2019s career\n\nIt has largely been plain and steady sailing for Murphy. So there are few massive jumps up the ladder. Just a confident drift through the business called show.\n\nDisco Pigs (1996)\n\nIt all began with this performance opposite Eileen Walsh in Corcadorca\u2019s ground-breaking play about two kids adrift in a nightmarish version of contemporary Cork. \u201cYou are always kind of reaching towards having that experience again,\u201d Murphy said. Also a 2001 film.\n\nOn The Edge (2001)\n\nRarely mentioned when people talk of Murphy or of director John Carney, this decent drama concerns a suicidal young man\u2019s experiences in a Dublin psychiatric hospital. Carney and Murphy also worked together on the first (apparently lost) version of the director\u2019s sci-fi comedy Zonad.\n\n28 Days Later (2002)\n\nHere\u2019s where the international film career really kicks off. Murphy plays a young man who wakes from a coma to discover the world infected by a virus that sends humankind deranged. This writer\u2019s contender for Danny Boyle\u2019s best film.\n\nBatman Begins (2005)\n\nMurphy has largely stayed away from franchise hell, but he makes an exception for his regular collaborator Christopher Nolan. The relationship began with his turn as the deranged Scarecrow in the director\u2019s first visit to Gotham. \u201cI wanted to avoid the Worzel Gummidge look,\u201d Murphy wisely remarked.\n\nBreakfast On Pluto (2005)\n\nSlightly tricky casting now. Murphy demonstrates his range by playing a witty transgender foundling in Neil Jordan\u2019s characteristically colourful take on a characteristically antic novel by Pat McCabe.\n\nThe Wind that Shakes the Barley, directed by Ken Loach and starring Cillian Murphy (left).\n\nThe Wind That Shakes The Barley (2006)\n\nThe first Irish film to win the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes. The first of Ken Loach\u2019s two triumphs at the event. Murphy is strong as an IRA volunteer in a movie that is as much about later betrayals of the revolution as it is about British tyranny.\n\nHippie Hippie Shake (2010?)\n\nA mischievous inclusion. Beeban Kidron\u2019s examination of the Oz obscenity trial in early 1970s London \u2013 featuring Murphy as Oz editor Richard Neville \u2013 deserves note here as one of the most mysteriously unreleased films ever completed. The reasons for its non-emergence remain undisclosed.\n\nPeaky Blinders (2013-2022)\n\nFor a large portion of the world, Cillian Murphy remains \u201cthe bloke out of Peaky Blinders\u201d. Set in Birmingham during the early part of the last century, the sprawling crime drama developed into a popular epic and made Murphy\u2019s Tommy Selby an equivocal anti-hero.\n\nA Quiet Place Part II (2021)\n\nMurphy was one of the stars entrusted with responsibility for opening cinemas again after the pandemic when he appeared as a reclusive survivor in this fine sequel to the 2018 horror. \u201cPeople kept sending me degraded pictures of myself on the side of empty buses,\u201d he said, noting how publicity for the film\u2019s first release date hung around after the virus hit.\n\nOppenheimer (2023)\n\nWho knew that a Christopher Nolan film about the birth of the atomic bomb would get so tied up with a study of Barbie? Murphy is surely in the race for an academy award as his portrayal of the eccentric J Robert Oppenheimer arrives simultaneously with Greta Gerwig\u2019s dolly flick. It\u2019s Barbenheimer time."

    "text": "We\u2019re glad to be living in a time when trailblazers like Cillian Murphy dominate the entertainment scene! Whether it\u2019s his riveting act in Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer or his stoic and daring persona in Peaky Blinders \u2013 Murphy\u2019s big Hollywood outings are par excellence. Truly dedicated towards his craft, Murphy is hailed for going all in for his projects, deeply immersing himself into the character he\u2019s playing. This all-encompassing approach not only involves intense mental preparation but undergoing a drastic physical change and Murphy has an exceptional ability to morph his physique. Having to constantly meet his characters\u2019 needs, Cillian Murphy has to change up his workout routine and diet plans every now and then. Fitness is never easy, folks!\n\nIf you\u2019ve been following the actor, you know that he usually opts to stay lean and slim. However, he took things a notch higher and started bulking up to transform into Peaky Blinders\u2019 Thomas Shelby. From indulging in strength training to upping his protein intake, the actor spruced things up to prepare for the role. On the other hand, his quest to look like physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer took him on a polar opposite journey, where he didn\u2019t think much about food and was borderline emaciated. Dwindling between extreme physicalities is no easy feat, but Murphy still aced it all.\n\nIf you\u2019re curious to know Cillian Murphy\u2019s workout routine as he prepped for both of the iconic characters, keep reading.\n\nCillian Murphy\u2019s workout plan to maintain a toned physique\n\nIn a conversation with The Radio Times in 2022, Murphy spoke about his workout routine for Peaky Blinders. \u201cI\u2019m not a very physically imposing person. So, I have to eat a lot of protein and lift a lot of weights and do all that stuff. So that takes a while, which I hate,\u201d he mentioned.\n\nWhat workouts did he exactly undertake? According to Jacked Gorilla, Murphy did a semi-basic routine that included core exercises, callisthenics as well as weight training. The actor worked out five days a week and had two days of complete rest. To fancify his training, the actor would also go for hikes. Let\u2019s break down his workout routine for you.\n\nMonday: Chest and Triceps\n\nChest and triceps are two of the most important muscle groups in your upper body, which when worked together, are very effective for building muscle mass. Doing compound movements that hit both these muscle groups together can optimise your results and make your workout sessions more time efficient. Working the chest and triceps together helps build functional upper body strength and improves posture as well as cardiovascular health. The intense workout also has mood-boosting effects that lead to reduced stress levels.\n\nHere\u2019s what Cillian Murphy\u2019s Monday workout looked like:\n\nBench Press (3 sets, 12 reps)\n\nPush Ups (4 sets, 25 reps)\n\nLying Tricep Extension with Dumbbells (3 sets, 10 reps)\n\nDips (4 sets, 10 reps)\n\nIncline Dumbbell Press (3 sets 12 reps)\n\nCore:\n\nSit Ups (3 sets, 20 reps)\n\nLying Leg Raises (3 sets, 20 reps)\n\nTuesday: Legs and calves\n\nMany of us HATE leg day and maybe Cillian Murphy does too! But sadly, there\u2019s no escaping this very important workout if you want to build those gorgeous calves. While you might dread the soreness in your legs post-exercise, let\u2019s familiarise you with some solid benefits of working this muscle that might imbue you with some motivation.\n\nStaying consistent with your leg workouts will enhance the body\u2019s strength, speed, and stability. Strong leg muscles give your body the much-needed balance which isn\u2019t possible with upper body workouts.\n\nSince your legs have bigger muscles, you can place more load on them. More load translates to more strength and more calories being used up. This leads to improved metabolism, which fosters the fat-burning process. Furthermore, leg exercises like squats and deadlifts strengthen your hips, make your body more athletic and less prone to injuries.\n\nFunctional exercises like lunges and squats are also great for your joints, promoting knee stability. According to the American Council on Exercise (via Medicine Net) leg workouts are the best way to prevent ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) tear (a common type of knee ligament tear). It\u2019s time to let the calf raises begin!\n\nCheck out Cillian Murphy\u2019s Tuesday workout:\n\nLeg Press (3 sets, 12 reps)\n\nCalf Raises on Leg Press (4 sets, 25 reps)\n\nGlute Ham Raise (3 sets, 10 reps)\n\nWeighted Lunges (4 sets, 10 reps)\n\nSquat Variation (3 sets, 12 reps)\n\nCore:\n\nCable Crunches (3 sets, 20 reps)\n\nHanging Leg Raises (3 sets, 20 reps)\n\nWednesday: Rest\n\nOn Wednesday, the actor took his well-deserved rest and so can you!\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Cillian Murphy (@cillianmurphyoffical)\n\nThursday: Shoulders and traps\n\nMany people train the traps and shoulders together as the upper portion of the traps is heavily involved in most shoulder exercises. Therefore, training the traps after the shoulders makes your workout efficient, as the former muscle is already warmed up and ready to go. For those unversed, trap workouts target the trapezius muscle \u2013 the broad, flat back muscle that looks like a trapezoid.\n\nBuilding both these muscles not only gives you those dreamy broad shoulders but makes all your upper body movements easier. Strong shoulders and trapezius muscles offer support in weight-bearing activities, reduce the pains and stiffness in arms as well as help recuperate from any upper body injury faster. Especially for people who\u2019re always in front of a screen and leading a sedentary lifestyle, shoulder and trap exercises will help avoid chronic pain in the back, neck, or shoulders.\n\nThis is the blueprint of Cillian Murphy\u2019s Thursday workout:\n\nSeated Military Press (3 sets, 12 reps)\n\nCable Front Raises (4 sets, 25 reps)\n\nHang Cleans (3 sets, 10 reps)\n\nBarbell Shrugs (4 sets, 10 reps)\n\nBent Over Shoulder DB Flys (3 sets, 12 reps)\n\nCore:\n\nSit Ups with Twist (3 sets, 20 reps)\n\nHanging Knee Raises with Twist (3 sets, 20 reps)\n\nFriday: Back and biceps\n\nBack and bicep workouts are often paired together because training the back involves a lot of bicep movement, which warms up this muscle without additional work. Working both the pulling muscles simultaneously allows for maximum recovery between sessions, giving you maximised results with minimum motion.\n\nWhen you combine the two, you actually get your biceps to work more because of their involvement in back exercises. Since biceps are considered a hard muscle group to build because they\u2019re very small, this workout is the best way to foster their growth. Moreover, as there aren\u2019t many variations in bicep exercises, combining it with back diversifies your session, making it more interesting.\n\nLet\u2019s look at Cillian Murphy\u2019s Friday workout checklist:\n\nHex Bar Deadlift (3 sets, 12 reps)\n\nWide Push Ups (4 sets, 25 reps)\n\nCable Rows (3 sets, 10 reps)\n\nChin Ups (4 sets, 10 reps)\n\nWide Lat Pulldowns (3 sets, 12 reps)\n\nCore:\n\nBicycle Crunches (3 sets, 20 reps)\n\nRussian Twists (3 sets, 20 reps)\n\nSaturday: Hiking\n\nGetting an adrenaline boost in the great outdoors is the perfect way to improve your mental as well as physical health. Hiking is a great whole-body workout that targets everything from your head to toe. From lowering the risk of heart disease, reducing anxiety and depression to building bone density and improving balance \u2013 hiking is one of the best ways to exercise, no matter what type of trail you\u2019re on! So, it\u2019s time to tighten your hiking boots, grab a water bottle, sunscreen, and venture outdoors!\n\nSunday: Rest\n\nCongratulations, you\u2019ve successfully completed Cillian Murphy\u2019s workout routine. It\u2019s time for some rest.\n\nCillian Murphy was on a calorie-deficit diet for \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019\n\nFor Oppenheimer, Cillian Murphy built an extremely slim frame to look like the eponymous creator of the atomic bomb. He was on an extreme calorie- deficit diet and lost weight so drastically that even his co-stars were in shock. In a conversation with Extra, Oppenheimer actor Emily Blunt revealed that Murphy \u201ccould only eat, like, an almond every day,\u201d adding that he was very emaciated.\n\nCillian, who\u2019s known for going to extremes to get into the skin of the character, also spoke about how he physically morphed into the character. Talking to The New York Times, he said,\u201d I love acting with my body, and Oppenheimer had a very distinct physicality and silhouette, which I wanted to get right.\u201d\n\nOwing to the scientist\u2019s thin physicality, the actor said he had to lose quite a bit of weight. Did you know that Oppenheimer passed away in 1967 owing to his unhealthy lifestyle?\n\nWhile Cillian might\u2019ve dared to tread on the scientist\u2019s dietary habits, you better not!\n\nHero image: Courtesy peakyblindersofficial/ Instagram; Feature image: Courtesy oppenheimermovie/ Instagram)"

    "text": "Cillian Murphy\n\nCillian Murphy\n\nLong before he was best-known as one of Ireland\u2019s greatest acting exports, Cillian Murphy had another brush with fame.\n\nThe Oppenheimer actor is a household name thanks to his star turns in shows such as BBC drama Peaky Blinders and films including Inception and 28 Days Later \u2013 but acting isn\u2019t his only talent.\n\nBefore finding fame on the small screen, a teenage Cillian formed part of the jazz-inspired band the Sons of Mr Green Genes.\n\nThe group, who took their name from a Frank Zappa song, even once appeared on Irish channel RT\u00c9, where Cillian did the best he could to explain their unique sound.\n\nIn a video which has reemerged on social media following the release of Oppenheimer, Cillian describes their experimental approach as \u201cnot [under] the constraint of any formula\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt came from the whole spirit of jazz, which is the freedom to express yourself on your instrument, which has been lost,\u201d he lamented.\n\nCillian then explained how \u201cit can be argued through the \u201980s and through the early \u201990s [bands were] playing to a pop formula.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the freedom to go a bit further,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously It has its roots in jazz and \u201970s music but it\u2019s moving on and becoming popular now.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great because people of our age are beginning to appreciate musicianship as opposed to a catchy tune.\u201d\n\nCillian Murphy's band never quite took off\n\nCillian Murphy's band never quite took off\n\nUnfortunately, the Sons of Mr Green Genes never quite hit the big time, despite once being offered a record deal.\n\nCillian later told 6Music\u2019s Steve Lamacq: \u201cWe were obsessed with Zappa when we were kids.\n\n\u201cDo you remember like the sort of early-mid-90s, when acid jazz was a big thing? That was a big influence on us. I think being in Cork in Ireland, we were probably a bit late to the party with that sound.\u201d\n\nWhile his music career fizzled out, Cillian soon discovered a love \u2013 and talent \u2013 for acting, making his stage debut in Edna Walsh\u2019s Disco Pigs play in 1996.\n\nHis latest movie, Christopher Nolan\u2019s biopic Oppenheimer, arrived in cinemas last month and has already broken records.\n\nREAD MORE:"

You're not the only one \u2014 it sounds like even the actor's costars in \"Oppenheimer\" weren't immune to his striking gaze.\n\nAnd Matt Damon told People Magazine in a group interview alongside Murphy and Emily Blunt that it could be distracting while on set.\n\n\"It's a real problem when you're doing scene work with Cillian,\" Damon said. \"Sometimes you find yourself just swimming in his eyes.\"\n\n\"It's like that 'Ocean Eyes' song by Billie Eilish.

Universal Pictures, PhotoQuest/Getty Images\n\n\"I've been staring at the cover of the book 'American Prometheus' for so many months, and there's this photograph, black and white, a light blue-eyed stare, very intense, of this guy,\" Nolan told The Hollywood Reporter. \"And I thought, 'Well, I know who could do that.'\"\n\n\"Oppenheimer\" is Murphy's sixth film with Nolan, but it's the first in which he takes the lead role.\n\nThe director told Entertainment Weekly in May that he was initially drawn to Murphy because of his \"crazy eyes.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I remember I was up in San Francisco writing 'Batman Begins,' and there was something in the San Francisco Chronicle about '28 Days Later.' I saw a picture of you with your shaved head and your crazy eyes \u2014 no offense,\" Nolan said.\n\n\"I remember being struck by your presence, literally from that one photograph, and then started to look into who you were and what you'd done, and got very excited about the idea of meeting you and having you screen test for Batman,\" the filmmaker told Murphy.\n\nThe Irish actor got the role of the villain Scarecrow in Nolan's \"The Dark Knight Trilogy,\" forming an 18-plus-year partnership. Murphy went on to play a wealthy businessman's heir in \"Inception\" and appeared as a soldier in \"Dunkirk.\"\n\nRead the original article on Insider"

    "text": "Cillian Murphy's biggest Best Actor Oscar competition\n\nThere could be not one but TWO fellow Irish actors competing against Cillian Murphy on Oscars night.\n\nWith Oppenheimer in cinemas now, and proving to be a massive box office success already, millions of movie fans around the world are witnessing the incredible performance by Cillian Murphy in the titular role.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the movie's release, Murphy was launched directly into the conversation around the Best Actor Oscar, with many believing he is pretty much a sure thing for a nomination, if not taking the gold trophy home on the night next March.\n\nWhile we're still a good way off from the big night - and with half of Hollywood currently on strike, there is no saying if the movies or the awards night will go ahead as planned - but from what we see at the moment, these are Murphy's biggest competition for that Academy Award.\n\nKingsley Ben-Adir - Bob Marley: One Love\n\nBen-Adir has already had a bonkers busy 2023, having appeared in Barbie and Marvel's Secret Invasion, but his role in this biopic of the famed musician is sure to send him into another level of fame. The Oscars love to give biopics some love - just look at Bohemian Rhapsody - so if Ben-Adir pulls this off, it could represent a major threat to Cillian's chances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGael Garcia Bernal - Cassandro\n\nBest known for his roles in Y Tu Mama Tambien, Werewolf By Night and Mozart in the Jungle, Bernal is already getting some incredible reviews for his performance in this biopic of gay wrestler Sa\u00fal Armend\u00e1riz in the 1980s. At the time of writing, the movie has a perfect 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes, with every single review aiming the majority of its praise towards Bernal's fearless turn.\n\nBradley Cooper - Maestro\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCooper already has nine - NINE! - Oscar nominations for his acting, writing, producing and directing, but while A Star Is Born landed those around him with awards, he unfortunately missed out. In Maestro, Cooper is once again writing and directing, plus he's starring as famed conductor and composer Leonard Bernstein, with the movie focusing on his relationship with his wife Felicia Montealegre, played by fellow Oscar nominations magnet Carey Mulligan.\n\nColman Domingo - Rustin\n\nNot quite as famous as some of the other potential nominees on this list, Domingo has been quietly stealing scenes in supporting roles in movies and shows like Lincoln, Euphoria and Selma for years. In his movie Rustin, which is being produced by the Obamas, Domingo is playing Bayard Rustin, the gay civil rights activist who helped Martin Luther King Jr. and others organise the 1963 March on Washington.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio - Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sixth time that DiCaprio and Scorsese have worked together, but to date, the only time DiCaprio has won an acting Oscar, it wasn't for any of his team-ups with Scorsese. Maybe this real life serial killer drama will change that. Early reviews are already claiming that this could be the best performance of DiCaprio's career to date, so if we were to guess, this will be Cillian Murphy's biggest competition on the big night.\n\nAlden Ehrenreich - Fair Play\n\nCillian Murphy's Oppenheimer co-star could end up sharing that nominations screen with him thanks to this intense erotic thriller. While this is normally the kind of genre that doesn't get too much attention, the early screenings have viewers pointing out Ehrenreich's pitch perfect performance in a movie that is filled with sex, money and corporate backstabbing. Sounds fun!\n\nMichael Fassbender - The Killer\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid Fincher's last five films - Mank, Gone Girl, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, The Social Network, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button - all landed their lead performers with an Oscar nomination. No reason to think that this dark psychological thriller set in the world of professional assassinations won't do the same for Fassbender.\n\nPaul Giamatti - The Holdovers\n\nThis is one of those actors that you would assume has a trophy case full of Oscars already, but nope. To date, Giamatti has only been nominated once, and it wasn't even for a good movie: Cinderella Man. By re-teaming with his Sideways director on this emotional comedy drama, Giamatti looks like he'll be delivering a performance that is practically guaranteed awards attention.\n\nBarry Keoghan - Saltburn\n\nYep, just one year after his Best Supporting Actor turn, our Barry could jump into the Best Actor race in this dark comedy thriller from the writer/director of the brilliant Promising Young Woman. In the new movie, Murphy plays a college student who becomes a bit obsessed with his classmate (Euphoria's Jacob Elordi), who happens to be from a very rich and aristocratic family.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix - Napoleon\n\nOne Oscar win already (for Joker), and three more nominations to date, it is clear that the Academy loves Phoenix. Here he is re-teaming with his Gladiator director for this epic historical drama, telling the rise to power of Napoleon Bonaparte, told through the lens of his relationship with Empress Jos\u00e9phine (Mission Impossible's Vanessa Kirby).\n\n\ufeff\n\nRelated articles:"

    "text": "Chris Hemsworth is undoubtedly one of this generation\u2019s finest action stars, and his portrayals in movies such as \u2018Thor\u2019 and \u2018Extraction\u2019 are a testament to his success. However, one movie that made him go to extreme lengths is none other than Ron Howard\u2019s \u2018In The Heart Of The Sea,\u2019 which saw him playing the role of Owen Chase.\n\nBefore that movie, Hemsworth never had a drastic physical transformation. But Howard\u2019s film was about a group of people stranded in the middle of the sea and fighting for survival. So, it doesn\u2019t come as a shock that the actor had to shed the pounds and restrict his diet. However, the diet was so meager that he and his co-stars, Cillian Murphy and Ben Whishaw, could barely have one egg a day.\n\nWhile speaking in an interview with Men\u2019s Health. Chris Hemsworth opened up about various aspects of the movie and didn\u2019t shy away from sharing the methods he employed to shed the pounds. He said, \u201cWe couldn\u2019t go away for a month and get skinny, we had to do it while we were shooting. At one point, a day\u2019s rations were a boiled egg, a couple of crackers, and a celery stick.\u201d\n\nChris Hemsworth also joked that 90% of their conversations on the set were about food. He added, \u201cI reckon about 90% of our conversations were about our favourite foods and what we would eat when we finished the film.\u201d\n\nThis drastic dietary restriction was necessary for Hemsworth to portray his character authentically, Owen Chase, who finds himself stranded at sea in the movie inspired by Moby Dick. Set in 1820, the movie follows the harrowing journey of Chase and his crew as they struggle against a sperm whale that captures their ship, leading to the deaths of many crew members. To accurately portray the physical toll of their ordeal, Hemsworth had to lose an astounding amount of weight. He previously revealed that he lost a staggering 15kg, equivalent to 33 lbs.\n\nIn a photograph shared on social media at the time, the Extraction actor showcased his usually muscular frame, looking notably bony, with long and shaggy facial hair. Alongside the surprising image, he humorously remarked, \u201cJust tried a new diet/training program called \u2018Lost At Sea.\u2019 Wouldn\u2019t recommend it.\u201d\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Chris Hemsworth (@chrishemsworth)\n\nThe Thor actor\u2019s dedication to his craft is evident in his transformation for this role. His commitment to embodying the physical aspect of his character is a testament to his versatility as an actor. Fans were taken aback by his slimmed-down appearance but made one thing clear he was willing to push the boundaries to deliver an authentic performance.\n\nFor more such news, stay tuned to Koimoi.\n\nMust Read: Margot Robbie Gets Trolled For Her Alleged Buccal Fat Removal, Lip Filler & Nose Job, Netizens Call It The \u201cPrime Example Of What Success Can Do For Your Looks\u201d\n\nFollow Us: Facebook | Instagram | Twitter | Youtube | Google News"

Murphy, who played American theoretical physicist J Robert Oppenheimer in the Christopher Nolan-directed movie, said Nolan's films don't have extra footage.\"There's no deleted scenes in Chris Nolan movies that's why there are no DVD extras,\" Murphy told Collider.He said \"Oppenheimer\" is no exception.\"The script is the movie. He knows exactly what's going to end up. He's not fiddling around with it trying to change the story. That is the movie,\" the actor said.In 2012, Nolan had also spoken about the lack of extra footage in his movies.\"I tend to try and weed things out on paper because it's crazy expensive to shoot things that aren't going to be in the film. It also takes up a lot of time and energy. Pretty much with all my films, there are very few deleted scenes, which always disappoints the DVD crowd,\" he had told MTV.\"Oppenheimer\" has made USD 552.9 million worldwide since its release three weeks ago, according to US media reports."

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nI think Oppenheimer is the biggest film I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d Christopher Nolan says without a hint of irony. It\u2019s a striking claim from someone who has directed some of the most gargantuan blockbusters of the past 15 years \u2013 but it\u2019s not inaccurate. At the heart of the biographical drama, which stars Cillian Murphy as the man who masterminded the birth of the atomic bomb, lies a truth of planetary scale. When the weapon was first tested \u2013 an event now known by its codename, Trinity \u2013 there was a chance that it might wipe out all of human existence. A prospect such as that would probably deter most people from proceeding, but not Oppenheimer; he pushed the button anyway.\n\n\u201cThe film I wanted to make couldn\u2019t have been done smaller,\u201d Nolan says of the $100m (\u00a377.7m) film one day after its world premiere in Paris. \u201cIt\u2019s not about money, it\u2019s not about budget \u2013 the magnitude of the story is what attracted me to it. The fact that Oppenheimer and his fellow scientists couldn\u2019t completely eliminate the possibility that they might set fire to the atmosphere and destroy the entire world, but still triggered the test \u2013 the idea of someone taking that risk on behalf of all of us and all our descendants. There\u2019s nothing bigger than that.\u201d\n\nThe film hinged, though, on finding the right individual to bring Oppenheimer to life. Murphy, 47, had worked with the filmmaker five times before \u2013 on the Dark Knight trilogy (2005-12), Inception (2010), and Dunkirk (2017) \u2013 but in supporting roles; always Nolan\u2019s bridesmaid, never the bride. This time round, he was wanted for the top job and, one chilly day in October 2021, the Irish actor received a call from Nolan informing him so. It was an instant yes.\n\n\u201cIn typical Chris fashion, he didn\u2019t tell me he was writing a script,\u201d a visibly tired Murphy tells me on the final day of the film\u2019s press tour; in just 24 hours, he will leave the UK premiere alongside his co-stars in solidarity with the actors\u2019 strike in Hollywood. \u201cThere was no build-up or warning; he just called me out of the blue and said, \u2018Would you like to play him?\u2019 I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t desperately want to play a lead for him. I think any actor in the world would want to work with Chris, whatever size the part. It was a dream.\u201d\n\nCillian Murphy chooses the Christopher Nolan film he would double bill with Oppenheimer\n\nNolan has long been one of the world\u2019s premier directors. After breaking onto the indie film scene with Following (1998) and Memento (2000), the London-born Nolan delivered the one-two punch of Batman Begins (2005) and The Prestige (2006), showing that he could steer projects of any size to both critical and commercial success. By the time The Dark Knight became the highest-grossing film of 2008, he had been handed the keys to Hollywood.\n\nOppenheimer is Nolan\u2019s 12th release \u2013 and it could be his least commercial one yet: a chewy, three-hour-long pressure-cooker of a film that\u2019s partly shot in black and white, and told in, you guessed it, non-linear form. It\u2019s well known that the writer-director opts to shun CGI in favour of practical effects: he had a rotating corridor created for mind-bending thriller Inception, brought in real battleships while filming the intense Second World War drama Dunkirk, and crashed a real 747 plane in the complex, divisive Tenet (2020). For Oppenheimer, he went one further \u2013 he recreated an atomic blast.\n\nIt was just one of the challenges Nolan set himself, to be able to create the film in the way he desired. That vision doesn\u2019t depict the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs that caused such suffering and destruction \u2013 an estimated 129,000 to 226,000 people were killed by the two detonations, which left a lasting trauma that still affects Japan (and, one could say, the entire world). To this day, Western filmmakers have only partially engaged with the true horrors of the atomic bombings. This is Nolan\u2019s interpretation of Oppenheimer\u2019s story.\n\nCillian Murphy and Christopher Nolan on the \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 set (Universal)\n\nFor Murphy, it\u2019s a big moment in his movie career. Earlier this month, he listened on as his Oppenheimer co-star Robert Downey Jr told him that his life would change now that he had been cast as the lead in \u201cthis huge film\u201d. The suggestion, though, that this is Murphy\u2019s breakout role was confusing to some. After all, the actor burst onto the scene more than two decades ago with his appearance in Danny Boyle\u2019s post-apocalyptic horror 28 Days Later (2002). Since then, he\u2019s gained worldwide recognition as the face of Steven Knight\u2019s period gangster show Peaky Blinders, released on the BBC in the UK and on Netflix practically everywhere else. What did Murphy make of Downey Jr\u2019s suggestion?\n\n\u201cHonestly, and I know every actor says this ad nauseam, but I don\u2019t think about it,\u201d he explains. \u201cPeaky Blinders is a phenomenon \u2013 it\u2019s all over the world and people adore it \u2013 but you can never think about that ancillary aspect of the work, because then you wouldn\u2019t do it properly.\u201d\n\nAccess unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trial Sign up\n\nAccess unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trial Sign up\n\nNolan\u2019s \u201cencyclopaedic\u201d knowledge of Oppenheimer protected Murphy from becoming too aware of any pressures his director was facing. Instead, he searched for a way to \u201cconnect with and find the truth\u201d of Oppenheimer \u201cin every moment\u201d of the film. In preparation, the actor watched David Lean\u2019s 1962 epic (and noted Nolan favourite) Lawrence of Arabia \u201cin terms of the scale and the life-story aspect\u201d. Also on the homework list was Milo\u0161 Forman\u2019s Amadeus (1984), \u201cbecause of Salieri and Mozart, that kind of competitive relationship\u201d, which was echoed in Oppenheimer\u2019s dealings with the slippery philanthropist Lewis Strauss (Downey Jr), an increasingly obstructive figure in Oppenheimer\u2019s life in the years following his creation of the bomb.\n\nI don\u2019t make films so I can look at myself. I really don\u2019t. Having said that, I did want to watch this movie with an audience, as that\u2019s how it\u2019s designed Cillian Murphy\n\nThe remainder of Murphy\u2019s supporting cast, a who\u2019s who of Hollywood, all deliver. There\u2019s Matt Damon on surly form as Manhattan Project director Leslie Groves, Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer\u2019s admirably patient wife Kitty, and Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock, the psychiatrist who had an extramarital affair with Oppenheimer. The multitude of physicist roles (there are a lot) are played by actors including Josh Hartnett, Benny Safdie, David Krumholtz and Kenneth Branagh \u2013 and for good measure, there\u2019s even Tom Conti as Albert Einstein, and Gary Oldman playing yet another world leader after his portrayal of Churchill in Darkest Hour: the American president Harry S Truman.\n\nIt was the assembling of this huge ensemble around Murphy that helped to convey the grandiosity Nolan was after. \u201cScale in cinema is a peculiar thing,\u201d he says. \u201cDoes it come from actions and effects? Or does it come from the most exciting actors of the day coming together to tell a story that\u2019s about the moment the world changes for ever?\u201d\n\nIndeed, for such an expensive film, Oppenheimer is surprisingly dialogue-heavy. Reviews have compared the scenes that focus on the hearings exploring Oppenheimer\u2019s involvement in the Manhattan Project with similar ones in Oliver Stone\u2019s JFK (1991) and Nixon (1995) \u2013 and there\u2019s more than a little Alan J Pakula and Sidney Lumet in the film\u2019s political intrigue. It\u2019s also filled to the brim with unsettling close-ups; in some scenes, it feels as if you\u2019d be able to touch Murphy\u2019s chiselled cheekbones should you reach out and try.\n\nHowever, he bristles at the reminder that his face will be blasted on cinema screens around the world \u2013 in Imax, no less \u2013 all summer long. \u201cI love watching Christopher Nolan\u2019s films when I\u2019m not in them,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to freak out about the size of your ears or whatever. I don\u2019t make films so I can look at myself. I really don\u2019t. Having said that, I did want to watch this movie with an audience, as that\u2019s how it\u2019s designed.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s how every Nolan film is designed. But with great power comes greater need for box office success. This could be seen as a corollary of making such large films, and I ask Nolan if he feels that this becomes reductive when it comes to measuring the true success of a release. \u201cI don\u2019t have an honest answer to that question,\u201d he says, before tackling it rather honestly.\n\nCillian Murphy in \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 (Melinda Sue Gordon)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of factors. My impulse is to tell a story, but I\u2019m not a filmmaker who works in a vacuum. I\u2019m not a filmmaker who purely makes a film for themselves. I make a film that I want to experience with an audience, and I make them at budget levels where you really have to try and find the widest crowd. I enjoy that form of communication. I think the Hollywood blockbuster, at its best, can reach people in a way that few other forms, including other forms of movies, really can, all around the world. Beyond that, box office numbers tend to be a little bit of an abstraction.\u201d\n\nThe project marked a significant departure for the writer-director: it\u2019s his first film centred on a real-life figure. Despite having American Prometheus as a resource, he found that he still had to grapple with the extent of Oppenheimer\u2019s brainpower. This is why the middle section of the film \u2013 focused on the construction of a top-secret lab in the New Mexico desert where Oppenheimer and his team could design, and test, the bomb \u2013 came as a relief to Nolan.\n\n\u201cOppenheimer had a whole other level of intellect than anyone we know, but it was useful to see him named as the director, literally, of the Los Alamos lab, and realise that what he had to do, in those three years, was bring together this disparate group of talents. He wasn\u2019t the smartest person there, but he was the guy bringing everyone together to get the most out of their talents. That\u2019s absolutely what I have to do as a director.\u201d\n\nChristopher Nolan behind the scenes of \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 (Melinda Sue Gordon)\n\nDespite making blockbusters that require him to spin hundreds of plates for an extended amount of time, Nolan is showing no signs of burnout. He is a director who consistently releases new films every three years, often commencing work on the next one months after completing the last. Will this regularity continue going forward? It seems a break is not on the horizon just yet. \u201cI find it hard to imagine not wanting to make films,\u201d he says, a childlike enthusiasm momentarily cutting through the seriousness. \u201cI will do this for as long as somebody would support me in doing it.\u201d\n\nWhenever that project comes to fruition, you can bet Murphy will \u201calways say yes\u201d should Nolan give him the call \u2013 even if it means having to endure seeing his face projected on giant screens. \u201cNo project is risk-free, but if you\u2019re working with one of the greatest living filmmakers, I think you\u2019ve got a good shot at knowing it\u2019s going to be good.\u201d\n\nBut the wait might be a little longer once Oppenheimer is released. Nolan acknowledges that following a project of this scale will take some doing. \u201cIt gets a bit more challenging to find subject matters that are different enough and also build on what you\u2019ve learnt as a filmmaker, so you slow down to a degree. But I love filmmaking, and in terms of budget, I would do it at whatever level I was able to. It\u2019s something I\u2019ll always do.\u201d\n\n\u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 is in cinemas now"

    "text": "After much anticipation, Christopher Nolan's first biographical project, Oppenheimer, was released in theatres on 21 July 2023. As expected, the film received excellent reviews, just like most of his previous projects. Known for creating thought-provoking cinematic marvels, Nolan has once again hit the ball out of the park with Oppenheimer. Despite tough competition from Greta Gerwig's fantasy drama Barbie, the movie has exceeded expectations by minting $80.5 million on the opening weekend alone, according to Variety.\n\nMade on a budget of $180 million (Rs 1476+ Crore), Oppenheimer stars a pool of talented actors like Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh, and Rami Malek among others. While these stars went all out to promote the biographical drama, Nolan, joined the bandwagon too and answered some intriguing questions which varied from his personal life to the filmmaking process, the source of ideas for his movies to the personalities who influenced his work, and more. Scroll down to learn more about the interesting revelations made by the ace filmmaker in recent interviews.\n\nFrom working with Cillian Murphy to his thoughts on directing a Star Wars movie, 7 interesting revelations made by Christopher Nolan in recent interviews\n\n1. On his equation with Cillian Murphy\n\nOppenheimer marks Christopher Nolan's sixth collaboration with Irish actor Cillian Murphy. The actor-director duo have teamed up in the past to deliver critically acclaimed films like Batman Begins (2005), The Dark Knight (2008), Inception (2010), The Dark Knight Rises (2012), and Dunkirk (2017). Calling Murphy an 'old friend', Nolan, revealed some exciting details about the former that'll leave you surprised. Talking about their first meeting, Nolan, in interaction with Wired, said, \u201cMet him first when he screen tested for Batman, and I think we both kind of knew he probably wasn't right for the role (of Batman), but his test was so exciting that the studio was okay for me to cast him as the villain\u201d.\n\n\"Cillian is one of the greatest actors of his generation or any other, and we've done six films together. And this is the first time I got to use him as the leading man\", he further added."

Everybody does it. I pronounce it Mess-cull.\u2019\n\nHe then went on to say that the mispronounciation had given him a business idea, but he\u2019s not sure if he\u2019ll lean into it or not.\n\nHe joked: \u2018I wonder if I launched a tequila line, I would call it Mescal\u2019s Mezcal. I\u2019m on the fence. Yeah, I\u2019m on the fence on that one.\u2019\n\nBarry Keoghan, Paul Mescal and Kerry Condon at the 2023 Oscars. Pic: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images\n\nBarry Keoghan has also experienced people mispronouncing his name, both in Ireland and abroad, and he clarified to Geek Ireland during Dublin Comic Con: Spring Edition 2022 what way he says it.\n\nHe explained: \u2018Keo-Gan. You pronounce the G. Or at least I do. Maybe I\u2019ve just been pronouncing it wrong all these years but yeah, the g sound is in there,\u2019 he confirmed.\n\n\u2018But I find that if you have a difficult to pronounce name, you\u2019re more likely to go far \u2013 especially in the US,\u2019 Barry added.\n\n\u2018Like Saoirse Ronan and all the talk of how to pronounce her name; so maybe it\u2019s a benefit having a peculiar name.\u2019"

Pero creo que tambi\u00e9n ten\u00eda la humildad necesaria para sobrevivir interpretando un papel como \u00e9ste\u201d, declar\u00f3 Downey Jr. a People.\n\nTe puede interesar: \u201cDuna: parte 2\u201d revela nuevos p\u00f3sters con Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet y Zendaya en el centro de la acci\u00f3n\n\nEl actor continu\u00f3 asegurando que Cillian se comprometi\u00f3 tanto con el papel que se aisl\u00f3 del resto del elenco para aprender holand\u00e9s. Curiosamente, esto fue para una escena de menos de un minuto de duraci\u00f3n en la que, precisamente, Oppenheimer brinda una conferencia en holand\u00e9s asegurando que lo aprendi\u00f3 en tan s\u00f3lo unas semanas.\n\n\u201cNos dec\u00edamos: \u2018Oye, tenemos un fin de semana de tres d\u00edas. Quiz\u00e1 vayamos a Santa Fe a comprar antig\u00fcedades. \u00bfQu\u00e9 vas a hacer?\u2019 \u2018Oh, tengo que aprender 30.000 palabras en holand\u00e9s. P\u00e1salo bien\u2019. Pero as\u00ed son las cosas\u201d.\n\nPara su papel como Oppenheimer, Cillian Murphy tuvo que aprender 30 mil palabras en holand\u00e9s (\u00a9 Universal Studios. All Rights Reserved)\n\nSin embargo, los idiomas son s\u00f3lo la punta del iceberg. Hace unos d\u00edas, Florence Pugh, quien da vida a la amante de Oppenheimer, Jean Tatlock, asegur\u00f3 que Cillian se someti\u00f3 a una dieta estricta en la que s\u00f3lo com\u00eda una almendra al d\u00eda. El mismo actor confirm\u00f3 que llev\u00f3 su cuerpo a l\u00edmites no muy saludables como un reto personal, algo que no le recomienda a otros actores.\n\nTe puede interesar: Muri\u00f3 Benjamin Zephaniah: \u201cPeaky Blinders\u201d y el legado art\u00edstico del activista brit\u00e1nico\n\n\u201cEs como si estuvieras en un maldito tren que va a toda velocidad. Es bang, bang, bang, bang. Duermes unas horas, te levantas y lo vuelves a hacer. Ten\u00eda una energ\u00eda de locos; super\u00e9 un umbral en el que no me preocupaba por la comida ni por nada... Pero era bueno porque el personaje era as\u00ed. Nunca com\u00eda (...) Te vuelves un poco competitivo contigo mismo, lo que no es sano. No lo aconsejo\u201d.\n\nCillian Murphy tambi\u00e9n asegur\u00f3 que llev\u00f3 su cuerpo hasta limites poco sanos\n\nMas recientemente, Florence Pugh asegur\u00f3 que Cillian era un actor con el que estaba \u201cdesesperada por trabajar\u201d.\n\n\u201cChris ten\u00eda en Cillian a uno de los protagonistas m\u00e1s incre\u00edbles. Es un actor al que he estado observando durante bastante tiempo y con el que he estado desesperada por trabajar. Habr\u00eda que estar loco para decir que no. Ha sido realmente una de las mejores experiencias que he tenido\u201d, afirm\u00f3.\n\nFlorence Pugh reconoci\u00f3 que deseaba trabajar con Cillian Murphy\n\n\u201cTrabajar con \u00e9l fue enormemente impresionante\u201d, contin\u00faa la actriz de 27 a\u00f1os. \u201cCada d\u00eda se presenta sabiendo todas las formas, entonaciones e inflexiones posibles para dar vida al personaje. Eso me impresion\u00f3 much\u00edsimo. Por algo es uno de los grandes\u201d.\n\nTomando en cuenta todo el sacrificio que Cillian Murphy hizo para darle vida a un Robert Oppenheimer completamente trastornado, todo parece indicar que la Academia ya tiene un favorito para la pr\u00f3xima edici\u00f3n de los premios Oscar.\n\nSeguir leyendo:"

    "text": "As \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d mania continues, there has been a major shift in the Oscar predictions for Best Director. According to the predictions of the Expert journalists we\u2019ve surveyed from major media outlets, Christopher Nolan (\u201cOppenheimer\u201c) now has an ever-so-slight edge against Martin Scorsese (\u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201c) for Best Director.\n\nAs of this writing 10 of those elite journos are betting on Nolan to prevail for his work on the biographical drama about the father of the atomic bomb. Compare that to nine who say Scorsese is out front. Thus far they are the only two directors with Experts predicting them to win the Oscar.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s early yet. We might see the pendulum swing back to Scorsese when \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d releases in October. Or another director could swoop in and usurp the front-runner position from both of them. But right now Nolan is in a particularly strong position.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t won an Oscar yet, which gives him the same king of overdue narrative that Scorsese had when he finally won Best Director for \u201cThe Departed\u201d (2006) \u2014 though Scorsese waited longer for his first trophy than Nolan has had to. And \u201cOppenheimer\u201d has that rare trifecta of important subject matter (the moral quandaries surrounding the atomic bomb during World War II), critical adoration (88 on MetaCritic, 94% freshness on Rotten Tomatoes), and box office success ($400 million globally after 10 days of release).\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d is a relatively early release, though, which is often a disadvantage since the Oscars typically prefer the fall films that are freshest in mind, but that didn\u2019t hurt \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once,\u201d which just swept the Oscars despite opening way back in March of 2022.\n\nWe\u2019ll have more Experts weighing in on the Oscar race as the season progresses, so no filmmaker\u2019s position is ever totally fixed, especially when the race is this close this early.

    "text": "Barbie, directed by Greta Gerwig, remained a runaway number one at the US box office in its fourth week, bringing in $33.7 million, according to studio estimates Sunday. The Margot Robbie-led and produced film from Warner Bros, still in 4,137 theaters, refused to drop off as most box-office toppers have this year, surpassing $500 million in North America overall a week after it crossed the $1 billion mark globally \u2014 a record for a female director. (Also Read | Justin Trudeau watches Oppenheimer with daughter after catching a Barbie show with son) Margot Robbie in Barbie (left) and Cillian Murphy in a still from Oppenheimer.\n\nThe second half of the Barbenheimer duo, Oppenheimer, returned to the number two spot in its own fourth week after a week at number three overall. The Christopher Nolan-directed film from Universal Pictures brought in $18.8 million from 3,761 locations for an overall domestic total of $264.3 million.\n\nStay tuned with breaking news on HT Channel on Facebook. Join Now\n\nThe top pair had thin competition. The week's only major wide release, Universal's The Last Voyage of the Demeter, finished fifth with a $6.5 million opening weekend.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, in its second week, earned $15.6 million domestically for third place, and the Jason Statham shark sequel, Meg 2: The Trench, brought in $12.7 million, dropping from second to fifth in its second week in theatres.\n\nBarbie is poised to become 2023\u2019s top film. Its $526.3 million domestic total and $1.18 billion global bankroll currently sits second behind The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which earned $574.2 million in North America, and $1.358 billion globally in the spring. It's also the second-highest-grossing film in the history of Warner Bros, behind only 2011\u2019s Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.\n\nThe sustained performance of the Mattel movie continues to flip the script on what had been a weak year in theatres, with major sequels underperforming including Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny and Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part I, which remained in the top 10 this week with $4.7 million.\n\n\"Barbie is as hot a commodity as it was in its first week. It's just ensconced at the No. 1 spot, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going anywhere soon,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cAnd Oppenheimer right there with it. They\u2019re just drafting off each other in this box office NASCAR race.\u201d\n\nThe midsummer Barbenheimer put the industry-wide summer total ahead of 2022. It was lagging behind just a month ago. \u201cIf you think of what Barbie and Oppenheimer together \u2014 just those two movies \u2014 have contributed in these weekends at the box office, it\u2019s really a staggering number,\" Paul said.\n\nAll movies combined this summer have earned $3.63 billion in North America. With significant releases remaining in August, including DC Comics' Blue Beetle, the video game adaptation Gran Turismo, and the Denzel Washington sequel The Equalizer 3, the box office has a chance of reaching the $4 billion that was considered a domestic benchmark for a strong summer before the pandemic.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at US and Canadian theatres, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.\n\n1. Barbie, $33.7 million.\n\n2. Oppenheimer, $18.8 million.\n\n3. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, $15.6 million.\n\n4.

    "text": "Since Oppenheimer's release, people have gone gaga over the big and loud spectacle that Christopher Nolan created. Many who aren't well-versed in science or physics for that matter found the movie entertaining and touching. Even though people have enjoyed the movie to the fullest, there are some amazing scenes in the film that many may have missed. Read on\n\nOppenheimer actually did try to poison his professor once\n\nThe film's opening scene introduces us to a young Oppenheimer buzzing with ideas as he embarks on his physics studies across Europe. While at Cambridge and grappling with severe depression, he becomes increasingly frustrated with his highly critical instructor, Patrick Blackett. Stricken by a surge of anger, the future father of the atomic bomb injects a deadly dose of potassium cyanide into an apple and puts it on the professor's desk. There was no need to worry as he immediately realizes his mistake and rushes back to the classroom to remove the poisoned apple, only to encounter his idol, Niels Bohr holding it.\n\nWater plays an important role in the film\n\nWater assumes a nuanced yet significant role in the film. The movie's introduction presents Oppenheimer amidst rainfall, his gaze fixed upon the puddles forming and splashing at his feet. This initial scene is swiftly disrupted by one of his catastrophic visions, portraying the world consumed by towering flames. Another moment involves Einstein and Oppenheimer standing by a pond at Princeton, potentially seeking respite from the havoc his invention brought on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nALSO READ: Cillian Murphy reveals THIS is the reason he didn't pursue music career\n\nWhy are some scenes in color and others in black & white?\n\nSimilar to Christopher Nolan's second movie Memento, Oppenheimer uses a combination of color and black-and-white scenes. His fans will recognize that the color difference serves the same purpose as in the earlier film i.e. to distinguish between two distinct past and present. The black-and-white sequences are situated post the Manhattan Project.\n\nThe metaphor behind the black hole research\n\nEarly in the film, before being recruited for the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer's focus is on studying black holes and neutron stars. In the scene where he's talking about Black holes with Jean Tatlock, on being asked about his study, he explains he's exploring \"how stars die,\" noting, \"the bigger the star, the more dramatic its demise.\" This line may have served to be a metaphor for Oppenheimer's life.\n\nGeneral Leslie Groves's promotions thorough out the movie\n\nDuring the Manhattan Project, Groves' promotions has been conveyed through his uniform changes. At his first meeting with Oppenheimer, he's a colonel, but he informs the scientist of his promotion to general for project contributions. The film subtly depicts his progression from brigadier, to major general through uniform. He retired as an honorary lieutenant general, as seen during the security hearings scene.\n\nALSO READ: Cillian Murphy recalls receiving Christopher Nolan\u2019s call for Oppenheimer: \u2018It was kind of euphoric\u2019"

    "text": "\u201c20 anos atr\u00e1s, quando comecei a trabalhar com Cillian [Murphy], j\u00e1 ficou aparente para mim que ele era um dos grandes atores\u2026 da sua gera\u00e7\u00e3o ou de qualquer outra\u201d. As palavras s\u00e3o de Christopher Nolan, que fez cinco filmes com o astro irland\u00eas de Peaky Blinders - come\u00e7ando com Batman Begins, em 2005 - antes de escal\u00e1-lo como protagonista em Oppenheimer.\n\n\u201cQuando este filme come\u00e7ou a tomar forma, eu liguei para ele imediatamente\u201d, comenta ainda o cineasta, em entrevista ao Omelete. \u201cDisse: 'Esse \u00e9 o nosso projeto. Voc\u00ea estar\u00e1 no centro do palco, e ter\u00e1 que carregar o p\u00fablico junto com voc\u00ea pelos altos e baixos dessa hist\u00f3ria'. Por sorte, ele estava pronto para o desafio.\u201d\n\nNas palavras do pr\u00f3prio Murphy, assumir o centro do palco em um filme do seu parceiro de longa data foi a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de um sonho. \u201cEu passei muito mais tempo no set dessa vez!\u201d, brinca. \u201cEu e Chris trabalhamos muito juntos, inclusive por seis meses antes do come\u00e7o das filmagens. A nossa colabora\u00e7\u00e3o foi muito mais estreita dessa vez do que nos outros filmes que fizemos juntos, o que foi uma \u00f3tima experi\u00eancia.\u201d\n\nO ator comenta ainda que a chave para entender seu Oppenheimer est\u00e1 em duas coisas: a voz e o figurino - especialmente por que o f\u00edsico que criou a bomba at\u00f4mica era conhecido como uma esp\u00e9cie de \u201crockstar\u201d da comunidade cient\u00edfica.\n\n\u201cN\u00f3s trabalhamos muito na fisicalidade do personagem\u201d, relata Murphy. \u201cEle era um homem charmoso, carism\u00e1tico - as mulheres o adoravam. Acho que, no fundo, ele sabia muito bem desse apelo que ele tinha, e criou uma imagem que se aproveitava disso... se voc\u00ea pensar na forma como ele se apresentava, com o chap\u00e9u e o cachimbo, foi tudo pensado nesse sentido.\"\n\nOppenheimer, enfim, pode marcar o \u00e1pice da parceria de diretor e astro, mas com certeza n\u00e3o marca o fim dela. \u201cEm todo esse tempo que eu conhe\u00e7o Cillian, ele cresceu muito como artista, fez trabalhos que o desafiaram e aperfei\u00e7oaram suas habilidades. Ele \u00e9 um ator espetacular com o qual trabalhar, al\u00e9m de um grande amigo meu. \u00c9 sempre um prazer estar com ele\u201d, define Nolan.\n\n\u201cEu confesso que n\u00e3o fico premeditando quais pap\u00e9is quero fazer no futuro, ou algo do tipo. A minha carreira \u00e9 meio aleat\u00f3ria nesse sentido\u201d, admite Murphy. \u201cA minha estrela-guia \u00e9 a vontade de trabalhar com as melhores pessoas poss\u00edveis... at\u00e9 por isso Oppenheimer foi t\u00e3o interessante para mim. N\u00e3o s\u00f3 Chris \u00e9 um dos melhores diretores de cinema vivos, na minha opini\u00e3o, como esse elenco \u00e9 fenomenal. Esse \u00e9 o tipo de trabalho que vale a pena para mim.\u201d\n\nOppenheimer j\u00e1 est\u00e1 em cartaz nos cinemas brasileiros."

    "text": "In an interview with Variety last month, director Steven Soderbergh suggested that the increased presence of technology has made it more difficult to create tension in movies.\n\n\"Cellphones are the worst thing that's ever happened to movies. ... It's so hard to manufacture drama when everybody can get a hold of everybody all the time,\" Soderbergh said.\n\nHowever, Christopher McQuarrie, director of the most recent \"Mission: Impossible\" film faces this problem head-on. McQuarrie takes the increased use of technology and makes it the villain in \"Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One,\" which releases Wednesday, June 12.\n\nThe seventh \"Mission: Impossible\" film pits Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt against an artificial intelligence machine known as The Entity. The machine's wide-reaching presence makes it difficult for Hunt and his team to use their usual advanced forms of technology as they race to defeat The Entity before any country can take control of it.\n\n'Dead Reckoning' highlights Cruise's star power\n\nReturning to Hunt's team are Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). Hunt also teams up with newcomer Hayley Atwell, who is known only by the name Grace in the film.\n\nAmid this cast, Cruise is the tentpole that holds up this film. Although the mission is still exciting, Cruise is the sole factor that should drive you to see \"Dead Reckoning.\"\n\nCruise has become famous for doing his own stunts, and he does not let up in this film, which has some spectacular sequences. The entire last segment of the movie, set on a train, had my jaw dropping lower and lower with each scene.\n\nAnd Cruise shines particularly well with McQuarrie, who directed Cruise in the previous two \"Mission: Impossible\" movies and worked on the screenplay for 2022's $1.5 billion hit \"Top Gun: Maverick.\" The pair has been collaborating since McQuarrie wrote \"Valkyrie\" in 2008, and it's a duo I hope will never end.\n\nCruise is the man Steven Spielberg said saved Hollywood, and it's obvious why in \"Dead Reckoning.\" Cruise, personal life aside, was born to be a star.\n\nAI scare runs strong in Cruise's new mission\n\n\"Dead Reckoning\" feels extremely timely, releasing at a time when AI services like ChatGPT and image generators are making people wary of the future of technology. The film takes this fear and capitalizes on it by making The Entity the central antagonist.\n\nMcQuarrie, who also wrote the film, runs wild with his ideas about AI, trying to ensure no one in the audience will be on board with the concept by the end of the film. Throughout the film, The Entity \u2013 who has a striking resemblance to Hal 9000 from \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (1968) \u2013 plays tricks on the team, causing them to question what's real.\n\nThis isn't the first time Cruise has had to go up against AI either. In 2021, one person impersonated Cruise with deepfake videos. And this year, another posted an AI-generated picture of Cruise with two lookalike \"stunt doubles.\"\n\n\"Dead Reckoning\" is a treat for anyone who's seen the previous \"Mission: Impossible\" films. Many of the series' iconic parts return here, from the intricate and realistic tearaway masks to the frequent use of slanted Dutch angle shots.\n\nAnd if the \"Part One\" in the film's title is making you hesitate to watch this film in fear of an unfulfilling cliffhanger, don't worry. The film has a solid conclusion that won't leave you feeling robbed."

    "text": "I don\u2019t know if anyone has ever clocked whether Tom Cruise is faster than a speeding bullet. The guy has legs, and guts. His sprints into the near-void have defined and sustained his stardom, becoming his singular superpower. He racks up more miles in \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One,\u201d the seventh entry in a 27-year-old franchise that repeatedly affirms a movie truism. That is, there are few sights more cinematic than a human being outracing danger and even death onscreen \u2014 it\u2019s the ultimate wish fulfillment!\n\nMuch remains the same in this latest adventure, including the series\u2019 reliable entertainment quotient and Cruise\u2019s stamina. Once again, he plays Ethan Hunt, the leader of a hush-hush American spy agency, the Impossible Mission Force. Alongside a rotating roster of beautiful kick-ass women (most recently Rebecca Ferguson and Vanessa Kirby) and loyal handymen (Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames), Ethan has been sprinting, flying, diving and speed-racing across the globe while battling enemy agents, rogue operatives, garden-variety terrorists and armies of minions. Along the way, he has regularly delivered a number of stomach-churning wows, like jumping out a window and climbing the world\u2019s tallest building.\n\nThis time, the villain is the very au courant artificial intelligence, here called the Entity. The whole thing is complicated, as these stories tend to be, with stakes as catastrophic as recent news headlines have trumpeted. Or, as an open letter signed by 350 A.I. authorities put it last month: \u201cMitigating the risk of extinction from A.I. should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks, such as pandemics and nuclear war.\u201d In the face of such calamity, who you gonna call? Analog Man, that\u2019s who, a.k.a. Mr. Hunt, who receives his usual mysterious directives that, this time, have been recorded on a cassette tape, an amusing touch for a movie about the threat poised to the material world by a godlike digital power.\n\nThat\u2019s all fine and good, even if the most memorable villain proves to be a Harley Quinn-esque agent of chaos, Paris (Pom Klementieff), who races after Ethan in a Hummer and seems ready to spin off into her own franchise. She tries flattening him during a seamlessly choreographed chase sequence in Rome \u2014 the stunt coordinator, Wade Eastwood, is also a racecar driver \u2014 that mixes excellent wheel skills with scares, laughs, thoughtful geometry and precision timing. At one point, Ethan ends up behind the wheel while handcuffed to a new love interest, Grace (Hayley Atwell, another welcome addition), driving and drifting, flirting and burning rubber in what is effectively the action-movie equivalent of a sex scene."

    "text": "At the end of the apocalypse, after the sun has fried every flower and tree, as the last skyscraper turns to dust, when each extant cockroach has gone belly-up with x\u2019es for eyes, there will be one man standing tall, or somewhat tall: Tom Cruise is forever, and if that idea may have seemed mortifying 40-odd years ago, when he was mugging his way through thinly disguised navy recruitment ads or grinning and grinding in his skivvies to Bob Seger\u2019s \u201cOld Time Rock & Roll,\u201d it\u2019s more palatable now. Cruise has never been a great or subtle actor, but he has grown into a perfectly watchable one, and that has come to mean more at a time when the movies are shrinking, literally and metaphorically. He\u2019s the star attraction of the seventh Mission: Impossible film, Dead Reckoning Part One, and he carries the film ably on his back, along with his always-at-the-ready parachute. Cruise, still in love with what big mainstream movies used to be, has become a chivalric dreamer, striving to ensure their survival by sheer will. Maybe he can pull it off and maybe he can\u2019t. But at least there\u2019s some pleasure to be had in watching him try.\n\nIf you\u2019re fond of MacGuffins, you\u2019ll love Dead Reckoning Part One, whose central thingie is a two-piece key that can be used to control an instance of artificial intelligence gone rogue, a manmade smarty-pants that has beehived into an all-seeing, all-knowing, all-powerful entity known, cleverly, as the Entity. Basically, it\u2019s all just an excuse for Cruise\u2014returning as Impossible Mission Force veteran Ethan Hunt\u2014to do stuff like ride motorcycles off cliffs and drive teeny-tiny cars down Rome\u2019s Spanish Steps. Cruise\u2019s devotion to practical action and his insistence on doing most of his own stunts, many of them quite dangerous, are already the stuff of legend, or at least a bunch of press releases, and it\u2019s not giving too much away to say that the plot of Dead Reckoning Part One\u2014directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who has been pulling the franchise\u2019s various strings and levers since 2015\u2019s Rogue Nation\u2014is virtually unfollowable after about the first third. The story exists only as flimsy interstitial tissue between the Tom-centric stunts, but maybe that\u2019s enough. Ostensibly greater movies have given us less.\n\nCruise, doing the stunts himself Courtesy of Paramount Pictures\n\nAll you need to know going in, really, is that every woman for whom Cruise\u2019s Ethan Hunt expresses even the tiniest bit of affection is doomed. But not right away, which means that Dead Reckoning brings back Rebecca Ferguson\u2019s silky-steely Ilsa Faust, of the most engaging characters from the franchise\u2019s last two entries, Fallout (2018) and Rogue Nation (2015). She, apparently, has one-half of the much-desired-by-many-parties key, which makes her a target of, well, everybody: We first see in her in the corner of the world where she\u2019s been hiding out, the Arabian Desert near Yemen. Ethan shows up on horseback, a dazzling sight wrapped in scarves and goggles designed to shield him from the swirly, sandy wind. There\u2019s an encounter, and an event. Shortly thereafter, the action shifts to IMF headquarters (\u201cthe other IMF,\u201d as one character quips wryly), where zillions of workers in suits are rushing to make hard copies of digital information\u2014on typewriters. You could make a whole movie about that and plenty of people would be happy, but admittedly, it would be rather low on action.\n\nCruise as Ethan Hunt, flying through the air on a motorcycle Courtesy of Paramount Pictures\n\nAs it is, the action in Dead Reckoning zips from the desert to the office to Rome to Venice to the Austrian Alps\u2014the locations alone are transportive, even if the plot is a mess. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames return as Ethan\u2019s sidekicks Benji and Luther, and the three of them make almost as many solemn pronouncements about loyalty and family and friendship as Vin Diesel does in the Fast and Furious movies. Ethan stands by his team; he\u2019s willing, he reminds us more than once, to die for them, and that includes any newbie who might enter the fold. In this case, that would be Hayley Atwell\u2019s Grace, a pickpocket extraordinaire and sleight-of-hand expert who, at any given point in the movie, may or may not have the all-important half-key. The point is to keep it out of the hands of Ethan\u2019s adversaries, which include Vanessa Kirby\u2019s Alanna, AKA the White Widow, and an acrobatic assassin, Paris, played by Pom Klementieff. Ethan\u2019s biggest enemy, though, is evil silver fox Gabriel (Esai Morales), who seeks the key to unleash chaos upon the world. Or something.\n\nAnd the stunts! Isn\u2019t that really what it\u2019s all about? They include, but are not limited to, a gorgeously staged duel between Faust and Gabriel, set on a slender Venetian bridge: Faust wears a silky topcoat whose tails whirl about her as her sword slashes through the air, intensifying the already intense aura of Venetian mystery and drama. There is that business with the almost-miniature vintage Fiat 500 and the Spanish Steps, though rest assured, no Spanish Steps were harmed in the making of this film. The movie\u2019s last third or so takes place in and around\u2014but also, of course, atop\u2014the Orient Express as it steams through the Alps. That section, already detailed in promotional videos for the film, also features Cruise speedflying\u2014not to be confused with skydiving\u2014over jagged mountain terrain. It\u2019s beautiful, and it does look pretty dangerous.\n\nEsai Morales and Tom Cruise fighting atop a moving train in 'Dead Reckoning Part One' Courtesy of Paramount Pictures\n\nCruise has invested a great deal of emotional energy in making sure we know it\u2019s really him doing these stunts, and you can\u2019t blame him. In a green-screen movie world, where the idea of excitement, if not the thing itself, can be filled in long after filming is done, it\u2019s rare to be able to watch a human being move like this. Cruise is muscular, feisty, nimble\u2014but he does have bones, like everyone else, and those bones are now 61 years old. He\u2019s the last survivor of his generation of action stars. Nicolas Cage and Bruce Willis have moved on, by necessity or choice, but Cruise still wants to do some version of what he has always done, whether it\u2019s flying, running, or wrestling down random baddies on top of a moving train. Ethan Hunt is a grave presence\u2014a recurring flashback in Dead Reckoning features snippets of a murder that looms large in his psyche, apparently influencing his every move. But Cruise doesn\u2019t have a naturally grave persona; he has to work at it, and so he does.\n\nAt a certain point in Dead Reckoning, Ethan is required to smile at one of the women in his orbit. She has just said something nice to him, or about him, and he must respond appropriately. So he stiffens his jaw ever so slightly, and his eyes crinkle like those of a painted Santa. This expression of veiled gratitude, of being a sturdy guy who knows it\u2019s better not to show much emotion, takes some effort, and you can see Cruise working to deliver. But even this not-quite-a-smile takes muscle and nerve. Think of it as a microstunt, less dangerous, certainly, than riding a motorcycle off a cliff, but a bit of risky business in its own right.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com."

    "text": "Tom Cruise made an impassioned speech about cinemagoing from Rome\u2019s Spanish Steps at the world premiere of \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a community that we are all part of \u2014 different cultures and ways of life, we all join together to enjoy cinema,\u201d said Cruise, dressed in a crisp blue suit and wearing aviator shades. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I grew up with, that made me and inspired me to dream and want to travel the world.\n\n\u201cMy goal since I was little was to make movies and travel. And not just be a tourist, but work in that world and understand their culture. Through my movies, I\u2019ve been able to have that because everyone here has allowed me to entertain them. It\u2019s a privilege that I have never taken for granted. It\u2019s my passion to entertain you, and I will always fight for big theaters and that kind of experience for everyone.\u201d\n\nCruise also paid tribute to his \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d director Christopher McQuarrie, calling the helmer his \u201ccreative brother.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s had a hand in every single film I\u2019ve made over the past 16 years,\u201d Cruise declared. \u201cUncredited, he wrote \u2018Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol.\u201d He\u2019s had a hand in editing and writing every single I\u2019ve ever done. He is my creative brother and an exceptional human being.\u201d\n\nTom Cruise (left) paid tribute to director Christopher McQuarrie (right) from the Spanish Steps red carpet in Rome.\n\nCruise, who reprises his role as Ethan Hunt in Paramount\u2019s latest tentpole, added: \u201cI want to thank Rome and the city. And also we got to film in Venice, which was extraordinary, during some very difficult times in this country. I dreamed to be coming here and [sharing] it with all of you.\u201d\n\nThe seventh installment of the \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d franchise was partly filmed in the Italian capital, where the cobblestoned streets provided the perfect pavement for drifting cars burning rubber in numerous hair-raising chases that are likely to go down in action film history. The Spanish Steps, by the Piazza di Spagna, is the setting of a wild car chase involving a massive Hummer chasing a tiny vintage yellow Fiat 500 driven by Cruise and Hayley Atwell, who are handcuffed.\n\nOn those very steps, Cruise \u2014 who spent the weekend in Rome ahead of the premiere \u2014 wooed crowds screaming \u201cTom! Tom!\u201d on the sunny Monday afternoon.\n\nCruise came to Italy with director McQuarrie and an ensemble cast of returning talents including Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson and Vanessa Kirby on the red carpet. Franchise newcomers Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis were also among those who made the trek to the Eternal City for the launch.\n\nAtwell, who plays thief and agent of chaos Grace, told Variety during a weekend junket that she trained for months on a race track with stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood for her Rome chase. Only after her hardcore training did she arrive in Rome to work alongside Cruise, who was determined to keep the stunts as real as possible.\n\nHayley Atwell (right) joined Cruise for the world premiere of \u201cMission: Impossible 7.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was handcuffed to Tom Cruise, who is in the passenger seat,\u201d Atwell recalled. \u201cBoth Wade and Tom said: \u2018We want you to go in front of this monument, do some 360 doughnuts, drift in, drift out, dodge cars and keep going.'\u201d\n\nDuring this feat, Atwell was told that \u201cTom\u2019s going to be suggesting lines to you [while] he\u2019s going to be acting as Ethan. But he also might give you moments of direction, too. Like: \u2018turn left\u2019 or \u2018slow down,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nSo Atwell\u2019s challenge, as she was drifting, was to work out: \u201cIs Tom as a producer telling me as Hayley to slow down because something is unsafe? Or is he as Ethan telling Grace to slow down?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was an amazing day,\u201d Atwell noted. After it was over, McQuarrie took her out to lunch and said: \u2018Tom put his life in your hands today. That was no small thing,\u2019\u201d she added.\n\nBy contrast, Pom Klementieff \u2013 who plays the psychopathic villain Paris \u2013 didn\u2019t train at all for scenes in which she drives the Hummer in pursuit of the yellow Fiat as it comes darting down the ancient staircase filled with screaming people who are jumping and running.\n\nFor Klementieff, the hard part was \u201cnot having too much fun doing it,\u201d she said during the junket. \u201cI was trying not to laugh the whole time, because for me it was so funny to be chasing a Fiat [500] \u2026 in this crazy Hummer.\u201d\n\n\u201c I had to tone it down a bit. I had to remember that I\u2019m a villain,\u201d she laughed. But Klementieff also noted \u201cthat some of that [irony] is in the movie, of course!\u201d\n\nThe entire \u201cMission: Impossible 7\u201d cast gathered in Rome for the movie\u2019s long-awaited world premiere.\n\nParamount\u2019s July 12 U.S. release of \u201cMission: Impossible 7\u201d \u2013 which also shot in England, Abu Dhabi and Norway \u2013 was pushed back several times from its original planned 2021 launch date due to pandemic-related setbacks.\n\nIn February 2021, the movie was forced to halt production in Italy, days before its planned shoot in Venice, as the country contended with one of the highest COVID death rates in Europe.\n\n\u201cIt was an absolute miracle this movie was made in the height of COVID,\u201d said Vanessa Kirby, who in the film reprises her role as the powerful arms dealer White Widow.\n\n\u201cIn every city we were in across the world, it was the middle of COVID,\u201d she added. \u201cSo it was amazing that they got the system [COVID production protocol] in place \u2014 and Tom drove it.\u201d"

    "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nTom Cruise \u2013 he\u2019s just like us.\n\nSpeaking in London ahead of the release of \u201cMission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One,\u201d Cruise shared that, yes, he feels fear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t get scared,\u201d the actor said. \u201cIt\u2019s that I don\u2019t mind being scared.\u201d\n\nAnd there ends our delusion.\n\nCruise, who famously does his own stunts, has put his body on the line time and again for the multibillion-dollar franchise. As superspy Ethan Hunt he\u2019s dangled from the world\u2019s tallest building, clung on to the outside of a plane during take-off, and performed a military-level high altitude, low opening (HALO) skydive no less than 100 times.\n\nIn the latest movie Cruise can be seen riding a motorcycle off a cliff before BASE jumping on to \u2026 actually, let\u2019s keep this spoiler-free. The stunt was filmed in Norway back in 2020 on the first day of the film\u2019s arduous, Covid-stricken production. It was one thing for Cruise to perform the stunt, quite another to watch, powerless to intervene, said writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, Cruise\u2019s long-term creative partner affectionately known as \u201cMcQ.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was just staring at the crosshairs on the screen, and I was waiting to see blue \u2013 blue was the color of his parachute,\u201d he recalled. \u201cOnce I saw blue, I was just making sure it was a square, because if it wasn\u2019t a square, it meant there was a malfunction. There was no coming back from it.\u201d\n\nCruise put his director through the experience six times to capture the stunt from all the necessary angles, which looks even more spectacular in the finished movie than the marketing material suggests.\n\nWith all that heart-in-mouth action, is McQuarrie still able to have fun? \u201cIt\u2019s more fun to finish a \u2018Mission Impossible\u2019 movie, for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge relief when it\u2019s all behind you and everybody\u2019s safe.\u201d\n\nTom Cruise and Rebecca Ferguson in \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One.\" Paramount Pictures\n\n\u201cDead Reckoning\u201d sees \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d lean into 21st century anxieties in the form of its villain. Dubbed The Entity, this faceless, stateless antagonist is an artificial intelligence capable of infiltrating pretty much any digital network to chaotic ends. (Yes, Tom Cruise hates streaming so much he\u2019s now squaring up to an algorithm.)\n\nThe star was reluctant to say much about the AI baddie, but when CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson caught up with the cast and crew in Abu Dhabi \u2013 the next stop on the film\u2019s globetrotting promotional tour \u2013 McQuarrie was more candid.\n\n\u201cWe were talking about it probably in early 2018, as something that even a few years prior would have been an intellectual or an abstract idea,\u201d he explained. \u201cI felt that people were starting to become aware of the way information and information technology was affecting their lives.\u201d\n\nAs for AI\u2019s impact on the movie industry itself, McQuarrie was diplomatic. \u201cLike any of the technologies that have been used in previous \u2018Mission Impossible\u2019 movies, it\u2019s less about the technology and more about who\u2019s using (it),\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re presenting here is just what happens when the technology potentially falls into the wrong hands.\u201d\n\nGetting the gang back together: Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson and Tom Cruise in the seventh film in the \"Mission Impossible\" franchise. Paramount Pictures\n\nFor resident gadget man Benji Dunn, The Entity is \u201chis worst nightmare,\u201d shared actor Simon Pegg. A series veteran who\u2019s known Cruise for 17 years, Pegg saw the actor-producer forced to go through more off-screen action than either would have liked when the film became the first major production impacted by Covid, while on location in Venice, Italy in February 2020.\n\n\u201cWe kind of wrote the rulebook on how to make a film in a pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cThe time that that took was challenging, because often we\u2019d have to stop, and there\u2019d be pauses in shooting, but we wanted to be as safe as possible.\n\n\u201cTom is never reckless with the stunts; with everything he\u2019s always very careful. But that was a challenge. It took much longer than it would normally do. But I think it\u2019s all up there on the screen.\u201d\n\nPegg did point to one upside, however: because of lockdowns, the cast, which included newcomers Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff, bonded quickly.\n\nFor Klementieff, a childhood fan of \u201cMission Impossible,\u201d it was \u201ca dream come true\u201d to sign on as Paris, who puts Hunt through his paces, including a thrilling hand-to-hand fight scene down a dark alley.\n\nDelivering a similarly athletic performance, Atwell described it as \u201can all-encompassing experience that asked everything of me physically,\u201d adding, \u201cI think I\u2019ll probably never have the experience again.\u201d\n\nEsai Morales and Tom Cruise in \"Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One.\" Christian Black/Paramount Pictures\n\nNever say never, because as the movie title suggests, Part Two is coming. \u201cIt was McQ\u2019s idea,\u201d said Cruise. \u201cWhen we were there (on shoot) I was like, \u2018remember, this is your idea.\u2019 There\u2019s so much story \u2026 it won\u2019t be confined by one film.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is on track,\u201d McQuarrie divulged of the sequel, slated for release in June 2024. \u201cWe\u2019ve shot in Africa, we\u2019ve shot in the Arctic, we\u2019re back here in London. Everything is standing by for us to go back to work after we\u2019re done promoting this movie.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done some amazing, amazing things \u2013 and the biggest is yet to come.\u201d\n\nCruise, arguably working in a category of one when it comes to Hollywood action heroes, is only competing with himself these days. \u201cI strive for excellence,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s always another story to tell, there\u2019s always another mountain to climb. And I always feel like I can do it better.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the kind of person that will beat myself up,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I\u2019m constantly working to become competent and strive to understand my craft and the world, and just keep pushing myself.\u201d\n\nAs for what happens after Part Two, the cast and crew are keeping mum. \u201cI have been misquoted many times \u2013 I don\u2019t know what happens next,\u201d said McQuarrie.\n\nPegg is a little surer about Cruise, Ethan Hunt and the franchise\u2019s fate. \u201cI don\u2019t see this story stopping,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he\u2019ll be jumping off things when he\u2019s 100.\u201d\n\n\u201cMission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d is released in cinemas worldwide starting July 12."

    "text": "Tom Cruise launches Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning at UK premiere\n\nBy Steven McIntosh Entertainment reporter\n\nHow Tom Cruise scares his Mission Impossible crew\n\nTom Cruise launched the seventh instalment of the Mission: Impossible franchise at the film's London premiere on Thursday.\n\nThe actor described Dead Reckoning - Part One as the \"biggest moment\" of the film series to date.\n\nHis co-stars Simon Pegg, Hayley Atwell, Rebecca Ferguson and Vanessa Kirby joined him on the red carpet.\n\nCritics' reviews of the film will be published on 5 July, before the film's release on the 14th.\n\nCruise said the two-part film marked the \"culmination of all my skills\" and promised even those unfamiliar with the series would have an \"epic adventure\".\n\nMission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One sees him reprise his role of Ethan Hunt, as the Impossible Mission Force (IMF) set out to track down a terrifying new weapon that threatens humanity.\n\nReuters\n\nTom Cruise reprises his role as Ethan Hunt in the hugely successful franchise\n\nThe film was shot partly in the UK and features the usual death-defying stunts, including one in which Cruise jumps off a cliff on a motorcycle.\n\nSpeaking at the film's London premiere, he said that even as a child he had always wanted to make movies, and had devoted himself to taking on new challenges and learning new skills.\n\n\"Since I was a little kid, that's what I did,\" the 60-year-old told the PA news agency.\n\n\"When I was three or four years old I was jumping off my roof and climbing trees - I wanted to make movies, I wanted adventure, I wanted to travel the world.\n\n\"So that's what I do, I train - I really enjoy taking on different skills, to work to become competent in everything that I do.\"\n\nHe continued: \"It was actually years of training... because I fly jets, I fly helicopters, I fly aeroplanes. I'm a skydiver, I'm a parachuter, race cars, motorcycles.\n\n\"[This film] was a culmination of all my skills.... There's a lot going on there's a lot happening... [but] the most important part is getting the shot and getting the story across.\"\n\nPA Media\n\nVanessa Kirby, who also stars in the film, walked the red carpet in London ahead of its premiere\n\nThe process of shooting the film was hampered by Covid-19 lockdowns, with an audio recording of Cruise shouting at production staff for apparently flaunting guidelines leaked in December 2020.\n\n\"In 2020 there was a lot going on that was a huge challenge just trying to figure out how to make a film in those circumstances,\" he told PA.\n\n\"We kind of wrote the rulebook on how to do it and it was an extraordinary experience just sort of getting through - it made the shoot a little longer, but I think it's made the film better.\"\n\nEvery Mission: Impossible film in the franchise to date has made at least $180m at the worldwide box office.\n\nThe most successful so far is 2018's sixth instalment, Mission: Impossible - Fallout, which took $791m worldwide, although the early films were released at the turn of the millennium and their box office takings are not adjusted for inflation.\n\nCruise's other film credits include Oblivion, Vanilla Sky, Collateral, Jerry Maguire, Top Gun and its sequel Top Gun: Maverick.\n\nMore pictures from the premiere:\n\nReuters\n\nCruise spoke to the press at the film's premiere in Leicester Square\n\nReuters\n\nIndira Varma plays the head of an intelligence agency in the movie\n\nReuters\n\nActress Hayley Atwell's hand was kissed by her co-star Rebecca Ferguson as they walked the red carpet\n\nPA Media\n\nThe latest Mission: Impossible film is directed by Christopher McQuarrie\n\nPA Media\n\nActor Mark Gatiss plays another agency boss who, like Varma's character, is a member of the intelligence chiefs community\n\nReuters\n\nFranchise regular Simon Pegg posed for selfies with fans\n\nPA Media\n\nHayley Atwell starred in the Avengers and Doctor Strange films prior to the latest Mission: Impossible\n\nPA Media\n\nThe premiere was also attended by actress Amanda Abbington (centre), who walked the red carpet with her daughter and son\n\nPA Media\n\nOther special guests included model Sian Osborne and boxer David Haye\n\nPA Media\n\nThe film is released in UK cinemas on 10 July"

    "text": "Tom Cruise turns 61 on Monday, marking more than four decades since he broke on to the Hollywood scene and started his ascension to the mega-famous movie star we know today.\n\nBorn on July 3, 1962, in Syracuse, New York, Cruise got his start in bit movie parts before a breakout year in 1983, in which he starred in All the Right Moves, The Outsiders, and his breakthrough hit, Risky Business.\n\nBut it was in the 1990s when Cruise began to hit his stride as box office magic. From 1992-96, he made history when he starred in five consecutive movies that grossed $100 million or more in the United States: A Few Good Men, The Firm, Interview With the Vampire, Mission: Impossible and Jerry Maguire.\n\nHis starring role as Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible has also been a blockbuster boon. So far, the franchise's six films have grossed over $3 billion worldwide, with the seventh -- Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One -- coming to theaters July 12.\n\n\"It's unbelievable,\" Cruise told ET while premiering Dead Reckoning in Rome last month. \"I do pinch myself every day.... It's something that I've never taken for granted ... I just feel very privileged.\"\n\nAnd then, of course, there's Top Gun. The iconic original flyboy flick was the highest-grossing domestic film in 1986, and when Cruise returned to the role of Capt. Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell last year for Top Gun: Maverick, it was a triumph in more ways than one. The film became Cruise's first to earn over a billion dollars worldwide and was a major success for movie theaters just starting to dig their way out of COVID shutdown difficulties.\n\n\"I make movies for audiences,\" the actor told ET. \"I work so hard and I think about them the whole time and when you see how excited they are and how much they appreciate it - it's just beautiful.\"\n\nIn total, the man often referred to as \"the last true movie star\" has made himself a $10 billion career so far -- and he doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon.\n\nHowever, despite the money, and despite the moniker, for Cruise it's all about the craft.\n\n\"It's not about being a movie star,\" he insisted. \"It's about being an actor and concentrating on that and finding roles that are going to be a challenge for me... Movie stardom can come and go, but your craft within, you can work forever if you keep working hard at that.\"\n\nRELATED CONTENT:"

    "text": "Hayley Atwell is a veteran of the West End, the British television industry, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But it wasn\u2019t until she was cast in this summer\u2019s Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One that the 41-year-old British actor was tasked with her greatest challenge yet: keeping up with Tom Cruise. Before she embarked on a global press tour to promote the summer\u2019s most anticipated blockbuster, Atwell got on a call with her friend, the actor James D\u2019Arcy, to talk about preparing for the physically demanding role, why making the movie was the ultimate film school, and the secret behind Tom Cruise\u2019s maniacal running.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHAYLEY ATWELL: You look so sophisticated with your wall of books, your culture and your intelligence behind you.\n\nJAMES D\u2019ARCY: They\u2019re not actually books, it\u2019s all made out of wood.\n\nATWELL: It\u2019s a front.\n\nD\u2019ARCY: It\u2019s just a front, like the rest of my life. So this afternoon, I\u2019m playing the role of a hard-boiled journalist. I won\u2019t be taking no for an answer and there\u2019ll be no skimping round the edges with your answers.\n\nATWELL: I\u2019m ready. My phone\u2019s off.\n\nD\u2019ARCY: You go the extra mile. Speaking of which, how many miles have you gone today in preparation for the stunts that you do in Mission: Impossible?\n\nATWELL: Good question. Currently, I\u2019m running about 30K a week. I did a 5K run this morning and then some Pilates mobility strength training.\n\nD\u2019ARCY: I saw that on Instagram. It looks ridiculous.\n\nATWELL: Some people thought it looked like a medieval torture contraption.\n\nJAMES D\u2019ARCY: It does.\n\nATWELL: But yes, I\u2019ve done my 5K today, I\u2019ve done my Pilates with Sam Eastwood, and what I\u2019ve loved about working with her is that all the training I did had to do with creating physical behaviors that could then be incorporated in any kind of fight sequence or drifting-in-a-car sequence. It wasn\u2019t that we were chasing a particular aesthetic for Grace, my character\u2014it was getting to me to a point where I could be dynamic enough and safe enough to try a ton of different things and see what looked most effective and exciting for the audience.\n\nD\u2019ARCY: Did you say to Sam and all the other stunt people when you started, \u201cLook, obviously I don\u2019t want to get injured, I want to do as many stunts as I possibly can myself, but mainly what I want to do is run faster than Tom\u201d?\n\nATWELL: Well, bearing in mind I\u2019m in high heels and I\u2019m also handcuffed to him, just being able to not fall flat on my face was the initial goal.\n\nD\u2019ARCY: Does he run as fast in real life as it looks like he runs when you watch the movies?\n\nATWELL: Yes, but what I\u2019ve noticed on set is it\u2019s not his speed that\u2019s the most impressive. He\u2019s studied the form, he\u2019s studied how to run. So when he\u2019s running, it feels like it\u2019s with every cell in his body, as if he\u2019s running towards the thing he wants to save and also running away from a bear. There\u2019s not a lazy foot or a turned in knee at any point, and it creates this form that\u2019s really beautiful to watch because it\u2019s anatomically correct. It\u2019s kind of amazing because you think some people might be faster than him, but he runs with such an urgency where you feel it.\n\nD\u2019ARCY: Is that what he said to you? \u201cJust so you know, when I\u2019m running, I\u2019m always imagining a bear.\u201d\n\nATWELL: I imagine he\u2019s probably running away from journalists.\n\nD\u2019ARCY: Journalists like me, hard-boiled.\n\nATWELL: At one point I was running in the park and Sam said, \u201cWell, they\u2019ve now decided that they\u2019ll have you running beside him,\u201d and I went, \u201cWhat? On roller skates? How the hell am I going to do that?\u201d But then when they said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be in high heels and you\u2019re handcuffed,\u201d I was like, \u201cOkay. Well, I don\u2019t have to catch up with him then. I just have to try and match his energy.\u201d And he\u2019s very safe, so he\u2019s always making sure that I\u2019m not going to fall flat on my face behind him. There\u2019s a train sequence, and it begins with the train carriage vertical and we are standing on one end of it. It takes six seconds for this real-sized train carriage to go to horizontal to vertical, so on \u201caction,\u201d we would have to run up a very steep incline just in time to hold onto a bar, where we\u2019d be suspended with a ravine below us. And we did it about six times, and I was puffing and panting, and they said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to go again.\u201d And so we went back down and Tom looked at me, and I could see in his eyes that obviously what he was looking back at was someone who\u2019s probably in a bit of a frazzled state. And he was like, \u201cYou okay?\u201d And I just remember going, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t even know what I don\u2019t know.\u201d And he said, \u201cI think you may have adrenal fatigue,\u201d and I was like, \u201cOkay.\u201d And then he went, \u201cDo you want some chocolate?\u201d\n\nD\u2019ARCY: He produced some from his back pocket.\n\nATWELL: Within about 30 seconds, a beautiful box of raw dark chocolate arrived on set and I wolfed it down, and then we went again and I was faster, sharper, with a smile on my face.\n\nD\u2019ARCY: In Master and Commander, I had to climb to the top of the ship, and of course because you\u2019re on a ship, it\u2019s a pendulum. At the top, it feels very windy. And the other person up there with me was Russell Crowe, who was exemplary, like Tom, in terms of making sure that I was safe and okay. We were harnessed up, and he looked at me and went, \u201cJames, can you see my harness?\u201d I sort of looked down and went, \u201cWell, yeah, but they\u2019ll paint that out.\u201d And he went, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not good, mate. Take it off me,\u201d because he couldn\u2019t take his own harness off. And I was like, \u201cWhat?\u201d He said, \u201cTake the harness off me.\u201d So I\u2019m taking his harness off at the top of this ship and I\u2019m, by the way, harnessed in twice. He refused to climb it with a harness, so then he clipped in when he got there, was unable to take it off himself, and insisted that I took his harness off. And as I was doing it, I was thinking, if Russell falls off and dies, am I an accomplice in his death? Anyway, he didn\u2019t.\n\nATWELL: It\u2019s like when I had my harness put on, you\u2019ve got to pull your pants down in the middle of a set. You\u2019ve obviously got your long johns on underneath, but it sort of feels a bit like your mum\u2019s changing your nappy while you\u2019re standing there. It\u2019s a very humbling experience.\n\nD\u2019ARCY: It is a weird thing, isn\u2019t it? Because there\u2019s some part of you that thinks glamor, glamor, glamor. And yes, there is a bit of glamor, but so often you are standing there in your pants next to Tom Cruise having your harness adjusted thinking, \u201cI just want the earth to open up and eat me.\u201d\n\nATWELL: I think being on a film set, you have to leave your ego at the door because the things you end up doing are things that probably only your family has seen you do, and you have to create this trust where you can be dripped on by someone else\u2019s sweat, from the person that you\u2019ve only met a few weeks before, and it gets you\u2019re in the trenches with them quite quickly.\n\nD\u2019ARCY: Or you walk onto the set to do the kissing scene and your kissing partner shows up, and they go, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, I\u2019ve got a terrible cold,\u201d this is pre-COVID, and you\u2019re like, \u201cOkay,\u201d because there\u2019s no way around it.\n\nATWELL: That was the other extra challenge, COVID. The protocols were so strict.\n\nD\u2019ARCY: You basically couldn\u2019t see anybody or go anywhere. You were ferried to the set and back from the set, and then you were in a hotel room.\n\nATWELL: Yeah. At one point Tom was doing his own hair and makeup in Venice, so he would be like, \u201cIs it okay? Do I need powder?\u201d\n\nD\u2019ARCY: That\u2019s amazing. That film was such a big deal for the industry when you were shooting it because it was possibly the most visible film being shot over COVID, and obviously employed hundreds of people around the globe. I remember just from talking to you, but also I think it was in the press that McQ and Tom were absolutely determined that you guys were going to show the industry that it was possible to keep shooting through these difficult times.\n\nATWELL: Yeah, absolutely. It wasn\u2019t just our film, but Tom would be on the phone to studios, other productions, sharing how they problem-solved and worked around it to keep an ongoing working environment so that, like you said, hundreds of people can retain their jobs and it can have a feeling of momentum within very strict safety regulations. And because we\u2019d never seen anything like this before, you had to make up what those things were. There wasn\u2019t the textbook of when there is a pandemic, this is how you do a film of this size. And even things like when we worked in Norway, we all lived on a boat so that we weren\u2019t in town disrupting anyone\u2019s lockdown life. It was like we were this traveling circus in our own isolated bubble, and we knew also that all eyes were on us because of Tom\u2019s brand and the size of this franchise.\n\nD\u2019ARCY: I\u2019m going to switch gears a because I know you as a goof. When we worked together on Agent Carter, I always felt like you were quietly thinking about ways to, in the nicest possible way, trip me up, whether that be scaring me at lunchtime or on Halloween. So what I want to know is how long did you have to hide in Tom\u2019s trailer on Halloween in order to scare him, and how did you get in there?\n\nATWELL: I couldn\u2019t penetrate the compound, so I just picked on Simon Pegg instead.\n\nD\u2019ARCY: It was literally Mission: Impossible.\n\nATWELL: It was. But with pranks, it\u2019s important to state I don\u2019t like cruelty or anything that is mean. You have to test the waters to see if this is something someone will actually enjoy, and once that permission is granted, then it\u2019s fair game.\n\nD\u2019ARCY: Did you prank Tom? And when he gave you his famous Christmas cake, which I know he did because you gave me a slice of it, did you give him a bit of the Hayley Atwell famous Christmas cake?\n\nATWELL: What\u2019s that?\n\nD\u2019ARCY: It doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nATWELL: Well, he doesn\u2019t eat sugar.\n\nD\u2019ARCY: On a big film like Mission, how much room is there for playfulness, creativity, and permission to fail?\n\nATWELL: Great question. In the screen test, both McQ and Tom said, \u201cLook, we haven\u2019t got a script and we don\u2019t have a character written, so we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re looking for until we find it, but we want to find the actress we want to work with, and then we will together in real time throughout the course of filming write that character based on what you give us.\u201d Some people might find that terrifying, like, \u201cDoes that mean I\u2019m auditioning all the time?\u201d But because they\u2019re such gentlemen and you feel that they\u2019re on your side, you can\u2019t fail because there is that safety net of knowing they\u2019re only going to use the things at work. Tom would never say something was good or bad, it would just be different choices, offering up different things. And because they\u2019re so transparent with their process, Tom might do something and be like, \u201cI didn\u2019t like that, it didn\u2019t work,\u201d or he\u2019d watch playback and go, \u201cI thought it was going to read in one way, but what I\u2019m not feeling is this beat that we\u2019re missing. Let me try something completely different.\u201d And because he didn\u2019t bring his ego to the set and neither did McQ, they\u2019re working it out as they go along, very much trying to have an objective beginner\u2019s eyes on it all the time.\n\nD\u2019ARCY: That\u2019s what I wanted to ask you next. You said that Tom would watch playback and then say, \u201cThat\u2019s not quite reading the way I thought it would. Let me try something else.\u201d But of course, he\u2019s Tom Cruise. Did they afford you the same freedom?\n\nATWELL: Uniquely, it was the latter. And because that was happening quite early on, it meant that I built up more and more confidence to try and look at my own work objectively. There was one scene, it was a bit of a monologue and the camera was right in front of me, and my character is quite tired and vulnerable. I did it a number of times, and McQ and Tom were there, and we looked back on playback, and for me it wasn\u2019t working. Maybe 10 years ago I would\u2019ve been like, \u201cI\u2019m not good enough. It\u2019s me.\u201d But this time it was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to make this work, let\u2019s look at it technically.\u201d And McQ just went, \u201cI think the camera\u2019s in the wrong place because we have a camera that\u2019s right in front of you. It\u2019s a kind of confrontation with the audience because the audience is looking directly at you.\u201d But if the camera was moved slightly above and to my side, two things are happening. With the camera moving high, it creates a sense of pressure over the character who in the frame is looking smaller, so that instantly makes her appear more vulnerable without me having to do anything. Secondly, with it slightly more to the side, the audience is with me and they\u2019re starting to see the rest of the room the way that my character is seeing the room. So their visual is relating to my character\u2019s perspective rather than me trying to be interrogated by the audience and make them feel a particular thing for her. It was a revelation to me.\n\nD\u2019ARCY: What a film school for you. So often as actors, you arrive on set and the camera is where it is and you do the scene, but nobody says to you, \u201cThis is the reason we\u2019re putting the camera here.\u201d\n\nATWELL: I\u2019ve been used to working more with directors who will come in and we\u2019ll talk about the psychology or the inner-world of the character. That can be really useful, but also that feels more like that\u2019s my internal job, to bring a rich inner world and naturalism and an understanding of what my character wants in that moment, what the obstacle is, and playing with those. And you\u2019re right, they like the communication of explaining what\u2019s being picked up on the lens.\n\nD\u2019ARCY: It\u2019s 50 percent of filmmaking. Of course you have to find the emotion and you have to be authentic, but the camera can do so much for you.\n\nATWELL: Understanding the camera, understanding what the lenses do, understanding what the composition of the frame is doing and what that\u2019s communicating. And for me, that\u2019s the work as a film actor to know. It\u2019s developing a relationship with the DP so that I know what the camera\u2019s picking up. There\u2019s shots where I\u2019m running across a moving train and I can feel the camera that\u2019s on a crane that\u2019s trying to move at the same speed as the train, so I\u2019m sensing when it\u2019s turning to get me in profile and therefore, how long I have to keep in frame for that shot before I go out of it. And that is everything. It\u2019s knowing that the camera is your friend, and there\u2019s no point having this incredible, deeply moving, beautiful performance if the camera\u2019s way over there and you can\u2019t see any of it.\n\nD\u2019ARCY: It\u2019s a dance, isn\u2019t it?\n\nATWELL: It\u2019s a dance, exactly."

    "text": "Nine Network journalist Peter Overton has come out in defence of Tom Cruise, hailing both his skills as an actors and his role in reviving cinema.\n\nThe endorsement of the Hollywood icon comes after rumours that Cruise and his team banned Overton from attending the \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d premiere in Sydney last week and from interviewing Cruise on the red carpet.\n\nThe feud reportedly stems from a 2005 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview between the two, in which tensions flare over Overton\u2019s line of questioning about Cruise\u2019s split from Nicole Kidman and how the two will continue to communicate and care for their children.\n\nDuring the interview, which occasionally resurfaces in the tabloids and social media, Cruise told Overton he was \u201cstepping over the line\u201d and implored him to \u201ctake responsibility\u201d for his line of questioning. He also told Overton to \u201cput your manners back in\u201d.\n\nOverton was absent from the film\u2019s premiere this year, which was attended by many other news anchors, entertainment reporters and media identities. His absense has given rise to a rumour that he was \u2018banned\u2019 from attending due to his conduct in 2005.\n\nOverton has now spoken about the rumours and conceded that he was not invited.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have a clue,\u201d he told Nova Sydney\u2019s breakfast radio program \u201cFitzy and Wippa with Kate Ritchie\u201d when asked if he was banned from the event. \u201cNo, we didn\u2019t get an invite, but I also had another thing to do \u2013 the 6 o\u2019clock news,\u201d he said, in reference to his role as anchor of Nine\u2019s nightly news bulletin.\n\nOverton conceded that he hadn\u2019t spoken to Cruise in the 18 years since the interview, but said he continued to admire his work and what he had achieved for cinema from a distance.\n\n\u201cEvery now and then [the interview] pops up, but you know, I\u2019ve always said, I like Tom. I think it\u2019s amazing what he\u2019s done with \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201c. I\u2019ve seen that a couple of times. \u201cMission Impossible\u201d, I can\u2019t wait to see.\n\n\u201cAnd the bottom line is, he\u2019s a great actor, what he\u2019s done for Hollywood in a really tough period with COVID and so on, is he has put the big-screen movies back in the cinema in a huge way, and we\u2019re all going to see them.\u201d\n\nOverton told the trio he would definitely be attending the \u201cMission Impossible\u201d film and thought Cruise was fantastic to still be doing his own stunts and creating the kind of cinema he is today.\n\nThe film\u2019s writer and director Christopher McQuarrie has been similarly impassioned about Cruise\u2019s role in saving big cinema.\n\n\u201cThe person I want to compliment is the person who will always dodge the compliments. It\u2019s this man, Mr. Tom Cruise. When this whole process started four years ago, we were entering a period where it looked like this event was headed for extinction. It was a very real possibility that this medium that we loved so much was on its way out. One person said, \u2018No, we\u2019re gonna keep it going\u2019. And that\u2019s this man right here,\u201d McQuarrie said.\n\nWhen approached by Variety Australia, Nine denied its star presenter was banned from the premiere. Paramount Pictures, the distributor of the film, did not respond to a request for comment."

The first part of Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning is all set to hit the theatres on 12th July 2023 while the second part is scheduled for release on 28th June 2024. The actor has starred in six Mission: Impossible movies and rumors regarding his exit are surfacing on social media.\n\nThere are speculations that Cruise might wrap up his Ethan Hunt days after the second part of Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning. Director Christopher McQuarrie has confirmed that these two movies are not the end of the franchise as he has planned out the next installments.\n\nThe Mission: Impossible franchise may continue without Tom Cruise\n\nActor Tom Cruise first played the role of Ethan Hunt back in the first Mission: Impossible, which was released in 1996. For the next two decades, Cruise made sure that he puts his heart and soul into portraying the character and he starred in 5 more Mission: Impossible movies.\n\nHowever, the actor will turn 61 in July. Performing all those death-defying stunts in the franchise will surely take a toll on his health. Since the announcement of the two parts of Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning, there are rumors that Cruise is planning to exit the franchise.\n\nFandomwire Video\n\nAlso read: Why Tom Cruise\u2019s Mission Impossible Co-Star Demanded Insane $2,560,000 a Minute Paycheck in 2011 Movie\n\nChristopher McQuarrie talked about the future of the franchise\n\nIt has been revealed by several sources that director Christopher McQuarrie has planned out the future of Mission: Impossible movies and so far, he hasn\u2019t directly acknowledged rumors regarding Cruise\u2019s exit.\n\nAs per reports, the two parts of Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning are not the end of the franchise and he confirmed that they \u201calready have ideas for what\u2019s next.\u201d Mission: Impossible \u2013\n\nDead Reckoning Part Two will release on June 28, 2024, while the first part will release in the theatres next month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso read: Tom Cruise for Green Lantern \u2013 Mission Impossible Star Reportedly Eyed for DCU Project After His Failed Iron Man Film\n\nChristopher McQuarrie once talked about rumors regarding Tom Cruise\u2019s exit\n\nBack in August 2022, the audience needed some information regarding Cruise\u2019s exit, so McQuarrie acknowledged those rumors.

Paramount Pictures/Skydance\n\nAtwell, 41, seconded Pegg\u2019s claims of Cruise\u2019s dedication to making movies that audiences will love.\n\n\"It\u2019s very rare,\" she told The Times of the Risky Business star\u2019s attention to detail on set, recalling when he gave a runner-slash-aspiring-cinematographer a laminated cinematography guide.\n\nThe actress, who plays Grace in the action film, added that \u2014 similar to his treatment of everyone on a film set \u2014 Cruise values viewers and their experience with a movie above all else.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to make movies now to punish an audience,\u201d Atwell told the publication. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want films with the message that if you do not understand this, you\u2019re not smart.\u201d\n\nTom Cruise, Hayley Atwell and Christopher McQuarrie share the love at the premiere of Mission: Impossible\u2014Dead Reckoning Part One in Seoul. Han Myung-Gu/Getty Images for Paramount pictures\n\nThe Marvel star continued, \u201cI can tell when I watch some movies that the director has made it for themselves. I don\u2019t feel involved or I think, \u2018Am I stupid?\u2019 Tom\u2019s not a snob.\u201d\n\nAn example of this, Atwell said, was during a script read for a Mission: Impossible film \u2014 not Dead Reckoning Part One \u2014 when Cruise told the crew that he \u201cdidn\u2019t get\u201d a line, which translated to \u201cthe audience will not get it\u201d \u2014 and thus it was cut.\n\nNever miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nMcQuarrie, 54, the director of several Mission: Impossible movies and a longtime friend of Cruise, echoed Pegg and Atwell\u2019s statements about Cruise\u2019s desire to make movies that are fun for audiences.\n\n\u201cThere is an outsized importance placed on Oscars [and] films that not many people are going to see,\u201d he told The Times, noting that it is a phenomenon that he says is a \u201cwedge has been driven into the [film] industry.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAre you an artist or an entertainer?\u201d McQuarrie posed, before adding that Cruise \u2014 who introduced himself to McQuarrie as a maker of \u201cmass entertainment\u201d in 2006 \u2014 does not see these titles as \u201cmutually exclusive.\u201d\n\nThe cast of Mission: Impossible\u2014Dead Reckoning Part One in Rome. TIZIANA FABI/AFP via Getty\n\nPegg also raved to the publication about Tom\u2019s intense love of movies \u2014 the intersection of art and entertainment \u2014 and what it means for the future of film.\n\n\u201cPeople can argue that cinema is frivolous, but it\u2019s not,\u201d he told The Times. \u201cCinema brings people together at a time we\u2019re pulling apart, and that just added to Tom\u2019s determination to put people in a room together.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThe power of cinema is, for him, precious and it\u2019s vital we sustain it.\u201d\n\nThe Shaun of the Dead actor also opened up about his personal relationship with Cruise, telling the outlet that he was able to \u201chack my way through all the bizarre mythology\u201d surrounding the Top Gun star.\n\n\u201cOn one side he\u2019s Tom Cruise \u2014 this enigmatic film star everyone wants to know about \u2014 and on the other he\u2019s just a guy,\u201d Pegg said. \u201cI like being normal with him.\u201d"

    "text": "Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One director Christopher McQuarrie has teased that, while Tom Cruise's motorcycle jump stunt is the most dangerous stunt in the film, there is one coming in Part Two that just may be the most \"terrifying\" one yet.\n\nIGN's Stella Chung had the chance to speak to McQuarrie at Dead Reckoning's press junket in Rome about Cruise's stunts and she asked which one has scared him the most.\n\n\"It's coming,\" McQuarrie said. \"You haven't seen it yet. I mean, everything we do... In terms of this movie, definitely the motorcycle jump. But we have continued and we've pushed ourselves even further in Part Two, and you'll see. It's terrifying.\"\n\nFor those unfamiliar and not worried about stunt spoilers, the motorcycle jump, which you can watch the making of below, sees Cruise actually riding a motorcycle off an extremely tall cliff in Norway before jumping off it and deploying a parachute. Oh, and Cruise did say back in 2021 that this was the most dangerous thing he's ever done.\n\nLoading Play\n\nWhile McQuarrie wasn't ready to reveal any more about this \"terrifying\" stunt, he did talk with us a bit further at the film's red carpet premiere about stunts in general, if they scare him anymore, and how one gets the green light.\n\n\"Oh, they all do,\" McQuarrie said of these stunts. \"They're all terrible ideas. We have a motto on this movie now: 'This is a terrible idea - when do we start?' It never starts with awesome. It starts with, 'That's very ill-advised.' That's how you know you're on to something.\"\n\nCan't wait to see those terrible ideas in IMAX. #MissionImpossible pic.twitter.com/Wcw9U1p6CV \u2014 IGN (@IGN) June 24, 2023\n\nSpeaking of ill-advised, Cruise himself understands the risks these stunts bring with them and even said he wanted to perform the motorcycle jump stunt on day one just in case it killed him.\n\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One will be released in theaters on July 12, 2023, and Part Two will follow on June 28, 2024. For more, check out why Dead Reckoning was split into two parts and our breakdown of the 20 minutes of intense footage from Part One we saw at CinemaCon 2023.\n\nAdam Bankhurst is a news writer for IGN.

    "text": "Success at the summer box office this year has so far been mostly Mission: Impossible.\n\nSo much for the $2.3 billion \u201cAvatar: The Way of Water\u201d raked in last Christmas \u2014 movie theaters are back to being an armory of high-profile bombs.\n\nThis weekend, wobbly Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cThe Flash\u201d dropped a staggering 73% in its second week to a worldwide total of just $210 million. A more-than-50% decline for an expensive DC Comics superhero film spells trouble.\n\nConsider that fellow Justice League member \u201cAquaman\u201d made $229 million by his second weekend in the US and Canada alone.\n\nPixar\u2019s uninspired \u201cElemental,\u201d released June 16 and so far having grossed $121 million, will wind up as one of the Disney-owned animation studio\u2019s biggest failures ever.\n\nIn contrast, five years ago this month, \u201cThe Incredibles 2\u201d grossed $1.2 billion.\n\nDisney\u2019s live-action \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d has made a $500 million trickle, which is less than half of 2017\u2019s remake of \u201cThe Lion King.\u201d\n\n4 Tom Cruise and co-stars Haley Atwell (left) and Pom Klementieff attend the premiere of \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d in Abu Dhabi. AFP via Getty Images\n\nAnd \u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,\u201d starring 80-year-old Harrison Ford, is projected to open this weekend to just $60 million domestically \u2014 $40 million less than 2008\u2019s \u201cKingdom of the Crystal Skull.\u201d\n\nThe movie industry is trapped in an existential \u201cTemple of Doom.\u201d Disney execs staring at these numbers probably look like the guy in \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark\u201d when his face melts off.\n\nThe only bright spot so far this summer has been Sony\u2019s animated \u201cSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\u201d with $560 million worldwide.\n\n4 Disney execs are surely feeling the heat from the poor box office projections for the upcoming \u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.\u201d (\u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark\u201d pictured above.) Movieclips/YouTube\n\nOnly one man can save struggling movie theater chains. Again.\n\nAs if summoned by a desperate prayer, Tom Cruise will parachute in on July 12 with Paramount\u2019s \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One.\u201d\n\nThe film is expected to open domestically to about $90 million over five days \u2014 setting a possible record for the seven-film franchise \u2014 and heaps more internationally.\n\nIf I were Cruise, I\u2019d be jumping up and down on Oprah\u2019s couch. Because I would know full well that I am the only reliably bankable movie star left.\n\n4 Cruise\u2019s \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d earned a whopping $1.49 billion at the worldwide box office. \u00a9Paramount/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nIt\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that in May 2022 as theaters were hobbling along, Cruise and his (sometimes irate) efforts to finish and release \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d rescued cinemas around the world that had been sitting empty.\n\n\u201cMaverick\u201d was a sequel to a 36-year-old movie that millennials and Gen Z-ers who regularly flock to Marvel films couldn\u2019t care less about. Older fans of the heartthrob-filled original had no clue if it would be any good.\n\nBut the action movie opened the Cannes Film Festival, received euphoric reviews and ultimately grossed $1.49 billion worldwide.\n\nHarking back to the monolithic cultural moment of \u201cStar Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens,\u201d seemingly everybody saw \u201cMaverick.\u201d\n\n4 Cruise has become well-known for doing his own stunts in the \u201cMission Impossible\u201d films. YouTube\n\nYou see, what 60-year-old Cruise has managed in this phase of his career, quite brilliantly, is to become synonymous with Entertainment.\n\nNot prestige, not awards, not sexiness nor hilarity \u2014 a Cruise movie simply means a fantastic time had by all.\n\nFive years ago, I gave \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Fallout\u201d four stars and called the franchise \u201cthe best ongoing action series out there.\u201d\n\nIts consistent sky-high quality is, in large part, because of Cruise\u2019s well-known insistence on doing his own stunts. His overachieving attitude makes his thrill-ride movies more tactile and real than anything else in the genre.\n\nMarvel films, especially the woeful \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,\u201d feel increasingly like a 2.5-hour green screen exercise that audiences struggle to connect with.\n\nIn \u201cDial of Destiny,\u201d a very obviously CGI Ford runs on top of a moving train. The sequence is alarmingly fake and hard to believe.\n\nThat Cruise regularly puts himself in harm\u2019s way for the sake of a scene has become well-known to average moviegoers.\n\nPlus he does it with nuclear charm and unrelenting intensity, and we feel going in that he has worked extraordinarily hard for our money.\n\nI suspect that in three weeks Cruise and Paramount will make a ton of it."

    "text": "Tom Cruise made statements and, among other things, mentioned Greece at the premiere of his new film \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part 1\u201d, which opened in London.\n\nThe actor was talking to a reporter who told him he was from Greece. Then, Cruise took the opportunity to express his admiration for Greece.\n\n\u201cThank you for being here. I love Greece. Great food, great people,\u201d he told the reporter before telling him what makes this movie stand out compared to its predecessors.\n\n\u201cThis is bigger, this is luxurious. It\u2019s a massive, epic adventure. It\u2019s a part 1 and a part 2 because the story and scale of the film is so big. I make my movies for the theatres, for the big screen, and this is just off the charts,\u201d Cruise said.\n\nHis co-stars Simon Pegg, Hayley Atwell, Rebecca Ferguson and Vanessa Kirby joined him on the red carpet.\n\nCritics\u2019 reviews of the film will be published on 5 July, before the film\u2019s release on the 14th.\n\nCruise said the two-part film marked the \u201cculmination of all my skills\u201d and promised even those unfamiliar with the series would have an \u201cepic adventure\u201d.\n\nMission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One sees him reprise his role of Ethan Hunt, as the Impossible Mission Force (IMF) set out to track down a terrifying new weapon that threatens humanity.\n\nThe film was shot partly in the UK and features the usual death-defying stunts, including one in which Cruise jumps off a cliff on a motorcycle.\n\nSpeaking at the film\u2019s London premiere, he said that even as a child he had always wanted to make movies, and had devoted himself to taking on new challenges and learning new skills.\n\n\u201cSince I was a little kid, that\u2019s what I did,\u201d the 60-year-old told the PA news agency.\n\n\u201cWhen I was three or four years old I was jumping off my roof and climbing trees \u2013 I wanted to make movies, I wanted adventure, I wanted to travel the world.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what I do, I train \u2013 I really enjoy taking on different skills, to work to become competent in everything that I do.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cIt was actually years of training\u2026 because I fly jets, I fly helicopters, I fly aeroplanes. I\u2019m a skydiver, I\u2019m a parachuter, race cars, motorcycles.\n\n\u201c[This film] was a culmination of all my skills\u2026. There\u2019s a lot going on there\u2019s a lot happening\u2026 [but] the most important part is getting the shot and getting the story across.\u201d\n\nThe process of shooting the film was hampered by Covid-19 lockdowns, with an audio recording of Cruise shouting at production staff for apparently flaunting guidelines leaked in December 2020.\n\n\u201cIn 2020 there was a lot going on that was a huge challenge just trying to figure out how to make a film in those circumstances,\u201d he told PA.\n\n\u201cWe kind of wrote the rulebook on how to do it and it was an extraordinary experience just sort of getting through \u2013 it made the shoot a little longer, but I think it\u2019s made the film better.\u201d\n\nEvery Mission: Impossible film in the franchise to date has made at least $100m at the worldwide box office.\n\nThe most successful so far is the sixth instalment, Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout, which took $220m, although the early films were released at the turn of the millennium and their box office takings are not adjusted for inflation.\n\nCruise\u2019s other film credits include Oblivion, Vanilla Sky, Collateral, Jerry Maguire, Top Gun and its sequel Top Gun: Maverick.\n\nREAD MORE: Christian Bale vacations in Mykonos with his family \u2013 See phots and videos."

Nice to meet you too. Thank you for being here,\u201d Cruise politely replied before adding, \u201cI love Greece. Great food, great people.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the movie itself, Cruise explained \u201cThis is the biggest and most luxurious. It\u2019s a huge, epic adventure that\u2019s split into two parts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe scope of the film is very wide. I make my films for the big screen only. This film is unprecedented,\u201d the actor added.\n\nMission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One\n\nAccording to the synopsis of the latest movie, \u201cEthan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team embark on their most dangerous mission yet: To track down a terrifying new weapon that threatens all of humanity before it falls into the wrong hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith control of the future and the fate of the world at stake, and dark forces from Ethan\u2019s past closing in, a deadly race around the globe begins,\u201d the film\u2019s description continues. \u201cConfronted by a mysterious, all-powerful enemy, Ethan is forced to consider that nothing can matter more than his mission \u2013 not even the lives of those he cares about most.\u201d\n\nThe trailer gives a taste of all the action set pieces and daring stunts fans of the Mission: Impossible series have come to expect. Late last year, Cruise shared a behind-the-scenes clip of one of the stunts for the movie where he rode off of the top of a cliff on a motorbike before performing a base jump.\n\nSo excited to share what we\u2019ve been working on. #MissionImpossible pic.twitter.com/rIyiLzQdMG \u2014 Tom Cruise (@TomCruise) December 19, 2022\n\n\u201cThis is far and away the most dangerous thing we\u2019ve ever attempted,\u201d the 60-year-old actor said at the time.\n\nThe stunt coordinator for the film, Wade Eastwood, explained that Cruise had to study and train to perfect his skills. He spent \u201ca year of base training, advanced sky-dive training, a lot of canopy skills, a lot of tracking.\u201d\n\nTom\u2019s coach Miles Daisher described the star as an \u201camazing individual\u201d and praised him for his dedication in doing his own stunts. \u201cYou tell him something, and he just locks it in,\u201d he said, talking about \u201chis sense of spatial awareness\u201d and adding that \u201che is the most aware person [he has] ever met.\u201d"

    "text": "Tom Cruise is stepping behind the lens for a new mission \u2014 capturing images of his beautiful co-stars!\n\nThe Hollywood legend delighted fans at the premiere of his new movie, Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, in Seoul, South Korea on Thursday when he briefly commandeered a photographer\u2019s camera to take a snap of his co-stars in the movie \u2014 Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff and Vanessa Kirby.\n\n\u201cThis guy loves to give his leading ladies the spotlight \ud83c\udf1f\u201d Atwell captioned a video of the moment she shared on Instagram Friday.\n\nIn the clip, a dapper-looking Cruise is handed a camera as he stands among a group of photographers at the event. Text over the screen reads \u201cThe Moment Vs The Photo,\u201d as the actor familiarizes himself with the camera\u2019s settings.\n\nThe 60-year-old actor and producer then crouches down to capture the three women posing in their gowns on a stage above the event's red carpet.\n\nDetermined to get the right angle, Cruise leans down to his right to ensure he's nailed the perfect shot. An image of the photograph then appears in the clip.\n\n\u201cHow does it look,\u201d a voice asks Cruise as he walks away.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d the actor replies with a smile.\n\nTom Cruise in South Korea. Shutterstock\n\nIt's been a week of championing fellow stars for Cruise, who took a break from his action-packed schedule promoting his latest Mission Impossible movie \u2014 which is released in theaters next month \u2014 to tweet about some summer movies he's looking forward to watching himself.\n\n\u201cThis summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters,\u201d the actor wrote on Wednesday, alongside photos of himself and his Dead Reckoning director Christopher McQuarrie in front of each of the films' respective posters.\n\nNever miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up to date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nAmong the films he praised were Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the long-awaited sequel starring Harrison Ford as the legendary adventurer (out Friday), the atomic-bomb biographical thriller Oppenheimer starring Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer and Barbie with Margot Robbie. The latter two films will be released on the same day: July 21.\n\n\"Congratulations, Harrison Ford, on 40 years of Indy and one of the most iconic characters in history,\" added Cruise. \"I love a double feature, and it doesn't get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Oppenheimer and Barbie.\u201d\n\nPom Klementieff, Hayley Atwell and Vanessa Kirby in South Korea. Alamy\n\nCruise also recently praised how people of different cultures \"join together to enjoy cinema\" at the Dead Reckoning in Rome.\n\n\"It\u2019s something that I grew up with, that made me and inspired me to dream and want to travel the world,\" Cruise said, reported Variety. \u201cMy goal since I was little was to make movies and travel. And not just be a tourist, but work in that world and understand their culture.\"\n\n\"Through my movies, I\u2019ve been able to have that because everyone here has allowed me to entertain them. It\u2019s a privilege that I have never taken for granted,\" he continued in his speech, highlighting the importance of seeing movies in theaters. \"It\u2019s my passion to entertain you, and I will always fight for big theaters and that kind of experience for everyone.\u201d\n\n"

    "text": "Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise argued all the time during the making of Mission Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning \u2014 about how to keep you, the viewer, entertained for every second of the film.\n\n\u201cI get asked all the time, \u2018Do you and Tom ever argue?\u2019 Yes, we argue every single day on your behalf. It\u2019s not about my vision or Tom\u2019s vision. It\u2019s about your experience,\u201d McQuarrie told MovieMaker.\n\nMcQuarrie has directed two previous films in the series, Mission: Impossible \u2013 Rogue Nation and Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout, and his stunning track record with Cruise goes back to 2008\u2019s Valkyrie, which McQuarrie co-wrote. He first directed Cruise in 2012\u2019s Jack Reacher.\n\nJoining the fast-moving Mission: Impossible franchise nearly a decade ago meant trying to keep up a goal of making every movie outdo the last. Loud, gorgeous, and heartfelt, their films are like the grandest of operas with the finest musicians performing. Sometimes they get close to the stratosphere \u2014 as in the HALO jump for Fallout.\n\nBut for an especially thrilling scene in Dead Reckoning, they imposed a limitation (and some mild spoilers follow): putting Cruise behind the wheel of a tiny Fiat for a race through Rome.\n\n\u201cYou lose all sense of time because you\u2019re going so fast. It\u2019s so dangerous,\u201d McQuarrie told MovieMaker. \u201cFilming car chases is very chaotic. We were in Rome for a little over two weeks, with only three or four hours to film at some locations.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s our Q&A with McQuarrie about how research begets more research, how a little Zed camera can create a depth of perception, and the perils of chasing a stone downhill.\n\nSonya Alexander: How do you prepare the visual language for a film like Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One?\n\nChristopher McQuarrie: We were very determined to make a very different film from the previous Mission Impossibles. We want to keep the notion alive that these films evolve visually, from the first film all the way through to the present. A lot of that was looking back on it. Looking at what had worked. Looking at what we could improve upon.\n\nI worked with cinematographer Frasar Taggart, our gaffer Martin Smith who does all of our lighting, and Jonathan \u201cChunky\u201d Richmond, my first assistant camera operator\u2026 We were a little bit of a brain trust in constantly finding ways to keep the camera moving and keep the scenes alive. And always creating a little sense of instability in the story because of the chaos in the narrative.\n\nChristopher McQuarrie on Shooting the Fiat Chase\n\nSonya Alexander: Do you have any particular cameras you like to use for action sequences, like the Fiat chase?\n\nChristopher McQuarrie: It\u2019s less about the cameras and more about the lenses. In this particular sequence, for the chase in Rome, we used what was called a Zed cam. It is a very small, very flexible, very versatile camera. And larger cameras simply wouldn\u2019t have worked because the Fiat itself is simply so small.\n\nTom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie on the set of Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning \u2013 Part One from Paramount Pictures and Skydance.\n\nWe tried putting a full-sized camera on it and it was bigger than the car itself. I don\u2019t know if you remember The Flintstones, when they put the food tray on the car\u2026 that\u2019s literally what it looked like when you put cameras on it. You couldn\u2019t see through the windshield.\n\nAnd that\u2019s how we make these movies. The action dictates the kind of camera that we\u2019re working with. We explore every medium. What it comes right down to is what camera can get the job done and in many cases what camera can survive.\n\nSonya Alexander: What was the biggest challenge of doing the submarine scene?\n\nChristopher McQuarrie: The biggest challenge of the submarine scene was that a lot of what you are seeing is inside a space with no windows. There\u2019s no way to see outside. There\u2019s no way to create a three-dimensional geography. You don\u2019t really know where the submarine is in three- dimension space. All of our action sequences are about geography.\n\nIt was about creating the instruments inside the submarine to get a sense of how the submariners felt the world around them and understood 3D space. And all of that blocking is meant to put you in a submarine the way the crew would be there and creating that sense of spatial awareness.\n\nThe other thing is it\u2019s just a very cramped environment, built on a gimbal. The set could roll twenty degrees in all directions. It was very challenging. It was a very tight space. A lot of those actors weren\u2019t terribly experienced. In fact, one of the actors, it was his first time on camera. They were extraordinary. Over the course of shooting that scene, they really became the crew.\n\nWhose idea was this again? pic.twitter.com/PuRM82rzsp \u2014 Tom Cruise (@TomCruise) July 7, 2023\n\nA \u2018Little Spoiler\u2019 About Mission Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part 2\n\nSonya Alexander: When you do the research for these films, do you come across info that inspires future storylines?\n\nChristopher McQuarrie: Yes, absolutely. The submarine was a really good example of one. The research we were doing for that particular sequence inspired what\u2019s going to happen with the rest of the story, particularly as it relates to submarines. There\u2019s a little spoiler for you.\n\nSonya Alexander: What is the greatest strength of this film compared to the others?\n\nChristopher McQuarrie: I think that every film that Tom and I do takes all of the knowledge that we\u2019ve acquired from the previous films, and we apply it to that film. So, you\u2019re watching a film that\u2019s benefitting from all the previous Mission Impossibles, Edge of Tomorrow, Top Gun: Maverick.\n\nEverything we\u2019ve learned, we\u2019ve applied it here and we never stop. We never believe that we know everything. We\u2019re constantly confronting each other, confronting the narrative, and we\u2019re always trying to learn. We never get too comfortable to think that we\u2019ve got it all figured out. When you think you know what you\u2019re doing, that\u2019s when you get surprised.\n\nAlso Read: Who Is the Enemy in Top Gun: Maverick?\n\nChristopher McQuarrie on Arguing With Tom Cruise\n\nSonya Alexander: You\u2019ve collaborated with Tom a lot. What do you enjoy most about your collaborations?\n\nChristopher McQuarrie: There\u2019s no ego. There is no particular set of rules other than you\u2019ve got to entertain the audience. We need to engage the audience every single instant of the movie. In a strange way, the audience is there with us in every story meeting, in every test screening, in the editing room, on the set.\n\nYou\u2019re making the movie with us because we\u2019re constantly thinking about what your experience is going to be. And it makes it a very democratic process. It\u2019s not really about who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s all about what\u2019s right for the audience. That allows us to eliminate conflict.\n\nIf he has an idea that I don\u2019t understand or I have an idea that he doesn\u2019t understand, we just proceed and take it on its natural course and it either works or it doesn\u2019t. But ultimately, it\u2019s about whether or not you\u2019re having a good time in the movie. I get asked all the time, \u201cDo you and Tom ever argue?\u201d Yes, we argue every single day on your behalf. It\u2019s not about my vision or Tom\u2019s vision. It\u2019s about your experience.\n\nSonya Alexander: Since you\u2019re the writer and director, what pressures do you feel to actualize the visuals and story from the page?\n\nChristopher McQuarrie: The way I like to describe it \u2014 writing is pushing a boulder up a mountain, directing is running down the mountain with the boulder after you. Everybody is waiting for you when you\u2019re the screenwriter. They\u2019re all waiting for those pages. It\u2019s the blueprint for how the movie is made.\n\nIt\u2019s a very lonely and solitary place to be. And when you\u2019re directing, the clock starts. The firehose is on, and you have to drink from it. You\u2019re responsible not only for the enormous budget of the film, but you\u2019re also responsible for the safety of all of the people around you. It\u2019s a lot to balance on the head of a pin.\n\nMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One arrives in theaters, including IMAX, on Wednesday.\n\nMain image: Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie on the set of Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One from Paramount Pictures and Skydance."

    "text": "In the dynamic tapestry of the 21st century, a transformative synergy between social media and the film industry has emerged as a game changer in the entertainment world. The digital epoch has unrolled a platform for blossoming talents, tethering them to a global stage. Amidst the newcomers, Greg 'Tarzan' Davis shines brightly, having catapulted from viral social media fame to the glamorous realms of Hollywood, sharing the spotlight with industry legend Tom Cruise in two blockbuster hits.\n\nUnleashing high-energy, comedic content, Davis shook up social media and swiftly seized the digital world's attention with his Instagram series Living With Jane.\n\nHollywood, recognizing the organic and extensive appeal of Davis, turned its gaze toward him. Producers and casting directors were captivated by his charismatic persona and athletic capabilities, earmarking him for action-packed roles. Before long, he shared the marquee with the legendary Tom Cruise in two films.\n\n\u201cI got to see what Hollywood was like on a smaller scale of interacting with people entertained by your work,\u201d Davis shared about his ascend from social media to Hollywood. \u201c\u200b\u200bIt has helped me understand how people react to you when they enjoy something you've done.\u201d\n\nDavis' big breakthrough arrived in 2021 when he starred in eleven episodes of Grey\u2019s Anatomy as Dr. Jordan Wright. Yet, it was his big screen debut in Tom Cruise\u2019s 2022 blockbuster, Top Gun: Maverick, where audiences witnessed a new dimension of Davis, portraying the audacious pilot Lt. Javy 'Coyote' Machado.\n\nFew up-and-coming actors can claim they\u2019ve starred in not just one but two Cruise movies. Davis now has those bragging rights. On July 12, Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, already receiving a certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, is set to debut worldwide. This allows Davis to showcase his acting and stunt capabilities in what could potentially be this summer's blockbuster hit.\n\n\u201cI think ever since I started working with Tom, my life has gotten a little bit crazier. I'm a pilot. Now I ride motorcycles, skydive down, bungee jump, and I do a lot of exciting things. And Tom is very infectious regarding doing this stuff,\u201d Davis shared about his second stint with Cruise.\n\nIn this latest Mission: Impossible chapter, Davis brings to life Degas, one of the agents who pursues Ethan Hunt. Having worked twice with Cruise, Davis now regards him as a mentor and a friend. With Cruise's decades of experience, he's shared valuable guidance with Davis.\n\n\u201cThe biggest advice that he's ever given me is that whatever happens to you is because of you, whether good or bad; take control of your life because your decisions will shape the future. If something bad happens, you can correct it. And if something good happens, you can continue to produce the results that created something positive,\u201d Davis revealed."

    "text": "Until the 1980\u2019s, Hollywood had a strange relationship with the Vietnam War. While the war was actually being fought, movies, typically, did not depict the war unless they were something like John Wayne\u2019s The Green Berets. If the war was dealt with, usually it was done metaphorically, or by using another war as a stand-in, such as what happened with 1970\u2019s MASH. This started to change after the war finally ended, with the late seventies seeing the release of three major films \u2013 The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now and Coming Home, Despite their popularity, during the first half of the eighties, when the war was dealt with on-screen it was typically as wish fulfillment, where action stars such as Chuck Norris and Sylvester Stallone single-handedly refought the war, and won, to the delight of audiences.\n\nThat all changed when Oliver Stone made Platoon. For the first time, a Vietnam War movie was made by someone who actually served. Stone was a U.S Army veteran who was twice wounded, and received a Bronze Star, a Purple Heart and many other decorations. For the first time, Platoon presented a realistic depiction of the war through the eyes of the grunts, and it led to a whole slew of Vietnam movies, including Full Metal Jacket, Hamburger Hill, Casualties of War, The Hanoi Hilton, and many others. Stone himself would return to the war in 1989\u2019s Born on the Fourth of July, which would prove to be a defining film for it\u2019s star \u2013 Tom Cruise.\n\nFlashback to 1988. Rain Man was a massive hit at the box office, ranking as the top grossing film of the year and winning a whole slew of Oscars. While Dustin Hoffman took home a Best Actor trophy, his co-star, Tom Cruise, wasn\u2019t even nominated, and many thought he\u2019d been overshadowed by Hoffman, who had the showier role.\n\nYet, by the time the Oscars rolled around Cruise was already in the middle of shooting a movie that would earn him his first Oscar nomination, Born on the Fourth of July. For Oliver Stone, it was a passion project. He\u2019d long wanted to bring the true story of Ron Kovic to the big screen. Kovic was a U.S, Marine Corp Sergeant who was shot an paralyzed during the war. A paraplegic, upon his return home he became an outspoken anti-war activist, and his story resonated for Stone, who had actually been hired to adapt Kovic memoir in the seventies as a potential starring vehicle for Al Pacino. The project fell apart, and Kovic subsequently acted as a consultant for Coming Home, for which Jon Voight won an Oscar playing a paraplegic veteran heavily inspired by Kovic.\n\nIn the wake of Platoon, Stone was suddenly one of the most important directors in Hollywood, with his reputation only boosted by the success of Wall Street, which won its star Michael Douglas an Oscar. He decided that he wanted to return to the war by examining the anti-war movement, and indeed it would form the second part of his loose Vietnam trilogy, which would be concluded by Heaven & Earth, which would examine the conflict from the Vietnamese side.\n\nWorking with a heftier budget, Stone and his DP Robert Richardson would be shooting anamorphically for the first time, and they needed a real movie star to carry the movie. Stone could have had his pick of anyone, but his first and only choice was Tom Cruise. While this may seem like a no-brainer now, it was an unusual pairing at the time. Lets not forget that Top Gun had come out the same year as Platoon, and the two films could not have been more different in their treatment of the armed services. Stone even called Top Gun \u201cfascist\u201d, but he still wanted Cruise to play the part, mainly due to his Golden Boy reputation. Stone\u2019s theory was that it would be fascinating to see what Cruise would be like were his presumably bright future stolen away from him in an instant, as happened with Kovic.\n\nIndeed, the fact that Cruise is so young and promising in the first act makes the movie all the more bittersweet. The first act of the movie plays out like your quintessential Tom Cruise movie, with him the Golden Boy pride of his family, who they proudly send off to war. He comes back, initially, a shell of his former self, but gradually is reawakened and in his own way, is victorious in the end, albeit his victory is bittersweet.\n\nIn Cruise, Stone found a willing participant. In fact, Cruise was so gung-ho in his portrait that, for awhile, him and Stone considered using a nerve agent to simulate paralysis, only for the insurance companies to forbid them. As Laurence Olivier told Dustin Hoffman when he stayed up for days on end to play sleep deprived in Marathon Man, \u201ctry acting.\u201d\n\nCruise would spend a full year preparing for the role, and his physical transformation is a sight to behold, as outside of Tropic Thunder, Tom Cruise typically looks like \u2013 well, Tom Cruise. Here, with his moustache and receding hairline, Cruise disappears into the role, and indeed Kovic, who it should be noted is still alive and well, was so touched by his dedication that he gave Cruise his Bronze Star.\n\nStone would fill the rest of the cast with an interesting mix of actors, some of whom he\u2019d worked with before. Perhaps the two most important supporting roles would be played by two carry-overs from Platoon, Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger. Each would play a variation on the roles they played in that film, once again playing the hero\u2019s quasi-spiritual fathers. Dafoe would play a major supporting role as a fellow quadriplegic Kovic meets in Mexico, while Berenger would play a much smaller, but just as important part, as the Recruiting Officer for the Marine Corps, whose spiel leaves the impressionable Kovic desperate to enlist. It\u2019s essentially a cameo, but it\u2019s an important one. Other Platoon vets, including John C. McGinley and Mark Moses would show up in other roles, while actors Stone would work with again and again in the future, such as Frank Whalley and Tom Sizemore. One of the most important supporting roles would go to a young Kyra Sedgwick, who plays the girl Kovic left behind, who eventually becomes an anti-war activist and helps inspire his new take on the war.\n\nOverall, Born on the Fourth of July is a rich addition to the filmographies of both Cruise and Stone. For Cruise, it was a showcase role, and if anyone still doubted him in 1989, this movie would end any speculation that he was just a movie star, rather than a legitimately talented actor. Cruise is outstanding, and indeed it\u2019s the type of role I think Cruise could still play nowadays, although for the time being his focus seems to be more on pushing the craft of the action film further and further. Still, if he decided to return to more character-based stuff, I think Cruise could shock people.\n\nFor Stone, it\u2019s one of his best films as all the elements seem to come together perfectly here. At about 2.5 hours, it\u2019s a disciplined, but still epic story, and it\u2019s not quite as aggressive as his later work would be, with him never quite the same after Natural Born Killers. The editing was provocative for the era, but now it seems almost restrained, and Stone also benefits form having a great score by John Williams, which compliments the soundtrack selections perfectly. Stone actually only spends a brief amount of time in Vietnam here, as he\u2019d previously covered that territory about as well as he could in Platoon, but Cruise still had to undergo in the infamously difficult Dale Dye training method, which would become a standard for Hollywood war movies for years to come. Arguably the most harrowing part of the film would be set at a VA hospital, where Kovic, in disbelief, tries to overcome his injury, only to be faced with squalid, over-packed hospitals that make similar sequences in movies like Forrest Gump look cartoonish in comparison. Stone also goes to great pains to depict the anti-war movement in a realistic way, even hiring Kovic and perhaps the most famous anti-war protestor of them all, Abbie Hoffman to advise, with the film climaxing with Kovic protesting the Republican National Convention. If the movie has any failing, it\u2019s that Kovic\u2019s anti-war activities get relatively little screen time, with Stone more interesting in Kovic\u2019s physical and spiritual journey. One could almost argue that with Kovic still alive and well, the two could re-team on a second Kovic project, with him still an active anti-war demonstrator.\n\nIn the end, Born on the Fourth of July was a smash hit. While it didn\u2019t come close to making the kind of money Rain Man or even Platoon did, it still made over $70 million in 1989 dollars, and was the 10th highest grossing movie of the year. Inevitably, Cruise lost the Oscar to Daniel Day Lewis for My Left Foot, but Stone won an Oscar for Best Director. All these years later, it remains somewhat unheralded as the movies of Cruise\u2019s everyone remembers are his huge blockbusters, but to me, this contains his best ever performance and should be watched again and again."

    "text": "UPDATE SATURDAY AM: In the wake of the older-skewing, very expensive Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny stumbling at the box office with an $83.8M Friday-Tuesday domestic start, sources have called upon me to evaluate a similarly priced, older dude franchise sequel at around $300M. That\u2019s this weekend\u2019s Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, which, analyzed by the same measuring stick \u2014 particularly given the pic\u2019s U.S./Canada 5-day of $78M \u2014 is well-below the $90M tracking Paramount was hoping for. Three-day here is $54.2M.\n\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge and Harrison Ford in \u2018Indiana Jones and The Dial Of Destiny\u2019 Everett Collection\n\nBut here is the root of the root, and the bud of the bud, and that is Dead Reckoning and Dial of Destiny are not the same. Already, in its running global take of $122.2M through yesterday, Dead Reckoning is on the verge of overtaking the $130M global start of Indy.\n\nIn fact, Dead Reckoning is bound to have the upper hand in the long-run, particularly on a global basis.\n\nYes, I just said that.\n\nDead Reckoning\u2018s demos are very similar to Dial of Destiny: 55+ was both their largest quad (Mission at 22%, Indy at 25%), Men over 25 are dominant in the turnout (respectively 46%, 43%), the prime moviegoing demo of 18-34 is just over a third for both (37%, 36%), and so on.\n\nHang on for one great weekend with Hayley Atwell and Tom Cruise in \u2018Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u2019 Paramount/Everett Collection\n\nHowever, the reviews and audiences exits on Dead Reckoning bury Dial of Destiny. In updated Friday night PostTrak exits, Dead Reckoning gets 5 stars and 90% from audiences (Indy only received 4 stars and 79%), with men/women at 62% / 38% grading it 90% / 89% (Indy\u2018s grades for both were 74% and 85%). Deal with it, Disney: The ball was dropped quality wise on Dial of Destiny, and the sequel is suffering with critics and fans. We expect more from Lucasfilm, especially on a legacy finale.\n\nGrosses went down between Indiana Jones movies, while grosses went up on Mission movies: Dead Reckoning could see a 5-day franchise record still, besting Mission: Imposible II\u2019s $78.8M. The Cruise feature is still in its prime; keep reading.\n\nSaid one rival studio executive source this AM, \u201cWith these reviews and PostTrak numbers, I would expect this one to leg out through summer \u2014 these are strong numbers.\u201d\n\nIf anything, the Tom Cruise sequel has all the mojo to not only outstrip Indy domestically, but the potential to make significantly more overseas \u2014 even if China doesn\u2019t pull in a $100M+ gross like it did on Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout, Mission: Impossible \u2013 Rogue Nation, and Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol.\n\nCruise\u2019s previous three Mission movies generated over 70% of their global box office abroad. Indy is not going to do that. As we told you yesterday, the global outlook for Dead Reckoning is still around $240M; As of last weekend, Indy\u2018s global was slightly more domestic than foreign, 51% to 49%.\n\nBut wait a second, wait a second \u2014 wasn\u2019t Dead Reckoning suppose to open to $90M over five days? This is surely an upset, no? The reality of the situation here stateside is that there isn\u2019t any Top Gun: Maverick halo effect. That long-awaited sequel brought out non-moviegoers, people who haven\u2019t been to the movies in years. Dead Reckoning is bringing its finite, older-skewing fanbase. As a Mission movie, Dead Reckoning\u2018s start here isn\u2019t below its franchise expectations.\n\nHold on again \u2013 doesn\u2019t Dead Reckoning stand to lose as much money as Dial of Destiny? Both cost about the same. What\u2019s clear is that the industry is still releasing over-budgeted movies that were challenged by Covid stops; Dead Reckoning being one of the first movies to shut down because of the pandemic in Italy back in early 2020. The box office to profit measure for some of these tentpoles is still a hurdle, and will continue to be for a while. These movies weren\u2019t made under normal circumstances, and Disney and Paramount both invested heavily in prime IP under the notion that they would deliver, and it\u2019s better to perfect and avoid scaling back costs. Who doesn\u2019t want to invest more on a trusted franchise sequel, especially a global star who delivered one of the highest-grossing movies of last year in Top Gun: Maverick?\n\nHowever, as we said above \u2014 the word of mouth on Dead Reckoning will empower it, even with Barbie next weekend potentially posting Little Mermaid numbers ($95M+ 3-day) and adult-leaning Oppenheimer in the mix, and that buzz will carry the Cruise film through all ancillaries.\n\nLet\u2019s step back again and assess \u2014 Dead Reckoning is posting a lower 3-day and 5-day next to Dial of Destiny. Why is that? The notion is that with Dead Reckoning having all the goods in great reviews and audience exits, there was no reason for it to debut on a Wednesday stateside. The movie could have gone on Friday and saw a $78M 3-day, which would have been a record opening for the Cruise series. I was under the impression that the movie, at a long running time of 2 hours and 43 minutes, would benefit from a 5-day launch, given that there\u2019s fewer showtimes at cinemas, and it would propel word of mouth. However, another source splashed water in my face and reminded me that the exhibition infrastructure as it is has the capacity and the power to deliver enormous box office grosses: Hello, Avengers: Endgame was a three-hour movie and holds the opening domestic box office record opening with $357.1M.\n\nLike Indy, could Mission have expanded to a younger audience? Of course, and Cruise might want to consider hiring some popular YA stars for future sequels. Imagine the juiced gross on a Mission: Impossible if Harry Styles or Zendaya were part of the ensemble.\n\nCourtesy Everett Collection Everett Collection\n\nThe Cruise sequel is playing strongest in the East, West & Mountain. Meanwhile, red state fave Sound of Freedom is throwing off those percentages, as it\u2019s so strong in the middle of the country. Meanwhile, 53% of Sound of Freedom\u2018s $23.6M second weekend (up a massive 20%) is coming from the South, South Central, and Midwest (parts of the country that do very well with Cruise movies).\n\nPLFs and Imax screens are driving 42% of Dead Reckoning\u2018s business to date.\n\nIn 13 days, Sound of Freedom, with $82M, will have made more than Everything Everywhere All at Once\u2018s lifetime domestic of $77.1M. Of course, both movies appeal to polar opposites. But it\u2019s interesting to note their comparison, as both movies were unexpected outliers that were unforeseen in their success at the B.O.\n\nThis movie is stoking the Fox News Channel crowd to get out to the movies, and is appealing to them in its subject of child-trafficking, something which some right wingers believe is the fault of the left. The movie\u2019s success is a testament to its star, title, and release date: It headlines Jesus (Jim Caviezel from Passion of the Christ), and the distributor, Angels Studios, was adamant that the movie open on July 4. Why? The picture has the word \u201cFreedom\u201d in the title, and that says something to the red state crowd, especially on the Day of Independence.\n\nTotal weekend box office is an estimated $130.3M from all titles, off 2% from a year ago, when Thor: Love and Thunder led the box office in its second weekend, and +3% from pre-pandemic 2019, when Spider-Man: Far From Home held No. 1 in its second frame.\n\n1.)

Stateside, the 5-day is $76M after what is expected to be a $16M Friday and $52.2M 3-day at 4,327 theaters. Offshore opening will be $164M.\n\nAnything north of a $78.8M 5-day domestic is an opening record for the franchise stateside; currently, that benchmark is owned by the Wednesday-through-Sunday start of 2000\u2019s Mission: Impossible II. (Deadline\u2019s Nancy Tartaglione will have more details on foreign later this weekend.) China is eyeing a $27M-$30M weekend, not too shabby for a Hollywood film now. We\u2019ll take it. The last Mission: Impossible, 2018\u2019s Fallout, posted a $76.1M in the PRC (not accounting for inflation and currency swings); that was a much different time for Hollywood movies. Note Japan, a big Mission market, isn\u2019t in this opening suite.\n\nAngel Studios\u2019 Sound of Freedom continues to ring loudly at 3,265 theaters with a second Friday of $6M (+15%), a second weekend between $20M-$22.5M, and running cume that could reach $81M by EOD Sunday. This Jim Caviezel thriller is bound for a $100M-plus gross. Rivals are even betting substantially more.\n\nSony/Stage 6 Films/Blumhouse\u2019s Insidious: The Red Door is seeing a $4.35M Friday, -71%, with a second weekend of $13.5M, -59%, and running total by Sunday of $58.6M at 3,188 theaters.\n\nDisney/Lucasfilm\u2019s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, booked at 3,865 spots, is seeing a third Friday of $3.6M, -53%, and third weekend of $12.9M, -53%, and a running total by Sunday of $146.2M.\n\nDisney/Pixar\u2019s Elemental continues to hold in the top five with an estimated fifth weekend of $8.8M, a great -12% hold, and a running total of $125.3M. That will fire it past Lightyear\u2018s final domestic of $118.3M. Friday is estimated to be around $2.5M at 3,235 theaters.\n\nUPDATE, FRIDAY AM: Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One saw $8.3 million million on Thursday, repping a 47% decline from the Wednesday opening plus previews of $15.5M. The two-day total for the Paramount/Skydance feature is $23.8M from 4,049 theaters. Hopefully this film spikes today. I mean, it will spike today, it\u2019s just by how much given that A CinemaScore and 4 1/2 stars and 88% on Screen Engine/Comscore\u2019s PostTrak. Guys at 65% gave the movie its best grades at 90%. Women at 35% weren\u2019t that far behind at 86%.\n\nA $90M five-day total seems unlikely, with rivals spotting $50M over three days and $73M over five. We\u2019ll dissect what\u2019s up here on this near-$300M production as the numbers become clearer; the feature went through several Covid delays. Right now M:I\u2018s box office looks similar to that of Paramount\u2019s 2017 Transformers: The Last Knight, which was another long movie at 2 hours and 34 minutes that opened on Wednesday to $15.6M and Thursday to $8.1M for a two-day of $23.7M. However, that was largely a younger-guy-skewing feature versus the 74% over 25 here; and it was a B+ picture and not one of the fan-faves for the robots-in-disguise series. Last Knight\u2018s first Friday was $13.7M.\n\nLast night\u2019s 7 p.m. Dolby auditorium show for Dead Reckoning at the AMC Porter Ranch (30 minutes north of Los Angeles, and where Nicole Kidman shot the exhib\u2019s commercial) was nearly sold out. What that exemplifies for these big tentpoles is that we\u2019re under-screened when it comes to premium-format auditoriums. There\u2019s no reason why a big star like Tom Cruise should have to go around asking for more PLF screens on a movie for which he\u2019s already doing 360-degree press; exhibition has to build more of them if we\u2019re going to expand the marketplace. Mission is expected to have its grab of PLFs next weekend despite Universal\u2019s three-hour Christopher Nolan epic Oppenheimer muscling in.\n\nSpeaking of publicity, especially at a time when there aren\u2019t any late-night talk shows, Dead Reckoning had a ton of it. Cruise is becoming a rare movie star, together with Dwayne Johnson, who knows how to go all out in making a movie a fire-breathing event and having the world know about it. I mean, this movie was promoted at two different CinemaCons, 2021 and 2022; there was the Rome premiere where the pic was shot including a mind-blowing chase scene; as well as multiple global stops by Cruise. RelishMix says that the social media universe reach for Dead Reckoning is at an awesome 529.9M across TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube views, which is ahead of Top Gun: Maverick (401.5 SMU/$126.7M opening), John Wick 4 (452.3M SMU/$73.8M opening) and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (296.4M/$60.3m opening).\n\n\u2018Sound of Freedom\u2019 Everett\n\nMeanwhile, Angel Studios\u2019 Sound of Freedom continues to wow. The pic posted daily middays of $4M+, out-pegging Sony/Stage 6 Films/Blumhouse\u2019s Insidious: The Red Door every day. The latter pic took No. 1 last weekend with $33M. On Thursday, Sound of Freedom grossed an estimated $4.5M, +4% over Wednesday. Pic\u2019s last seven days grossed $36.5M for a running total of $58.5M. Angel Studios released a statement yesterday, squashing rumors that AMC has made it difficult for patrons to see the movie. That\u2019s fake news, with the circuit selling more than 1 million tickets so far for the Jim Caviezel thriller. The pic is getting 450 theaters added to the current count of 2,852 theaters.\n\nRed Door was third on Thursday with $2.5M, -1% from Wednesday and a first week of $45M at 3,188 locations.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny did $2.3M on Thursday at 4,600 theaters, even with Wednesday, for a second-week take of $38.6M and a running total of $133.3M.\n\n\u2018Elemental\u2019 Disney\n\nDisney has fifth place with Elemental and a fourth Thursday of $1.6M, +6% from Wednesday, with a $17M fourth week; its running total is $116.5M at 3,440 theaters. Get a load of this: Despite the Pixar movie opening lower than Lightyear, $29.6M to $50.5M, it\u2019s going to outstrip that Toy Story spinoff\u2019s final domestic total of $118.3M.\n\nUPDATED THURSDAY AM: Paramount reported $15.5M for the Wednesday opening day of Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, which includes previews. The studio isn\u2019t reporting a 3 and 5-day projection as those type of forecasts can be wonky and it ultimately boils down to Friday business.\n\nRivals, however, are betting at this point in time that Dead Reckoning isn\u2019t as big as the $90M tracking purported it to be. More like $47M for the 3-day and $70.5M per industry estimates right now. The worry here is if this is Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny all over again with a very expensive film near $300M production cost, long-running time and older dude skewing franchise falling short of expectations. There\u2019s a chance on a five-day basis, this could still be a franchise record start: Mission: Impossible II has the best five-day opening for the Cruise series at $78.8M.\n\nWith a running time of 2 hours and 43 minutes, it\u2019s clear that Dead Reckoning is appointment viewing for moviegoers like Avatar: The Way of Water and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. However, it\u2019s a fast 2 hours and 43 minutes given the awesome action set pieces in the movie.\n\nLast night on Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak, Dead Reckoning looked similar to Indy\u2018s Thursday night demos with 34% over 45, 74% over 25 and heavily male at 65%.\n\nHowever, here\u2019s the box office viagra that Ethan Hunt has over Indiana Jones, and hopefully this will bode well in spreading word of mouth, especially with the younger demos: Dead Reckoning has an A CinemaScore to Dial of Destiny\u2018s B+. That\u2019s the second A for a Mission movie after 2018\u2019s Fallout. The franchise counts three A- grades for Rogue Nation, Mission Impossible III and Ghost Protocol. Mission: Impossible did B+ while Mission: Impossible II got a B. It\u2019s also one of the best reviewed Missions of all-time at 96% certified fresh to Fallout\u2018s 97% certified fresh. In addition, Mission\u2018s edge over Indy is that Cruise and the franchise are more of a draw at the overseas boxoffice than the Lucasfilm IP (which isn\u2019t even known in certain big markets like China). Korea and Japan are expected to be big for Dead Reckoning. It\u2019s overseas in the end that could possibly bail this very pricey Mission movie out. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny opened to $130M WW, with a domestic 3-day of $60.3M. The Friday-Tuesday five day was $83.8M. Current global on the Lucasfilm franchise finale is north of $256M WW.\n\nOn social media, RelishMix spots, \u201cConvo tone on Dead Reckoning runs positive as fans acknowledge Tom Cruise\u2019s tireless tenacity as Hollywood\u2019s modern daredevil, proclaiming he\u2019s \u2018hauling modern cinema on his back.\u2019 Paired with filmmaker Christoper McQuarrie\u2019s daring direction and newcomer Hayley Atwell, some already herald it as potentially \u2018the best action movie of all time.\u2019 This series is being elevated above competitors, notably Fast X and The Fast and Furious franchise, with fans assertively favoring its consistently epic entries \u2014 \u2018This franchise is the movie embodiment of aged fine wine.\u2019 Even with a chorus of praise, a handful of viewers yearn for fresh elements, countering the franchise\u2019s predictable beats. Yet, the Mission: Impossible saga continues its powerful performance, captivating its loyal audience and igniting anticipation for this new chapter.\u201d\n\nUPDATED WEDNESDAY PM: Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u2018s opening day is looking like $16 million, which includes the $7M in previews.\n\nYes, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny and Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout both posted first days in the $22M-$23M range, but those were Fridays. This is about the long play of the movie, and Tom Cruise fare is back-loaded. The reason why this pic is going for the five-day record is due to its length, at 2 hours and 43 minutes. It\u2019s expected, especially with a current great Rotten Tomatoes audience score of 94%, to get to $90M, a franchise record opening, by Sunday. Again, it\u2019s still early. These numbers could go up.\n\nSound of Freedom is looking at second place with $3.9M and a running total of $53.4M. That daily gross is holding steady with Monday and Tuesday. Very impressive.\n\nUPDATE AFTER EXCLUSIVE: Paramount/Skydance\u2019s Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One came in at the high end of expectations with $7M in previews. Pic was booked at 3,300 locations and hikes its theater count up to 4,000-plus today including Imax and PLF.\n\nI\u2019m told that the fan PLF money from Monday shows isn\u2019t included in that $7M figure. The previous chapter, Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout posted Thursday previews of $6M, a record for the franchise. Next to other summer comps, Disney/Lucasfilm\u2019s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny posted $7.2M in previews.\n\nThe Rotten Tomatoes audience score out of the gate after previews is 94%.\n\nTom Cruise and filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie have been touring the film; the duo making stops in Toronto, Atlanta, Miami, and Washington DC, greeting fans at cinemas.\n\nTom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie make a surprise appearance Tuesday at \u2018Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u2019 screening at the AMC Sunset Place 24 in South Miami Getty/Paramount\n\nYessica Borroto Perryman in \u2018Sound of Freedom\u2019 Everett Collection\n\nIn early estimates this morning, Angel Studio\u2019 Jim Caviezel thriller Sound of Freedom won another weekday with $4M yesterday, beating Sony/Blumhouse/Stage 6 Films\u2019 Insidious: The Red Door which had $3.48M. Both pics had even holds from Monday percent-wise. Sound of Freedom raises its running total to $49.7M in its eight-day run. Wow. It\u2019s expected that the pic will post a -30% ease in weekend 2 with around $13M-$14M after a $19.6M reported 3-day last week. Red Door\u2018s five day run rises to $40M.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Paramount/Skydance\u2019s Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning \u2013 Part One is looking at $6M-$7M in previews so far, which is bound to be higher than the Thursday previews of the last Mission Impossible \u2013 Fallout back in 2018 which did $6M. This is according to sources. The figures we\u2019re seeing now could go higher or lower.\n\nDead Reckoning previews began at 2PM today, however, I hear there were PLF fan screenings on Monday and that handful of bucks is accounted for in the estimate.\n\nDead Reckoning is one of the longer films of the summer at 2 hours and 43 minutes with credits. Not as long as Oppenheimer\u2018s 3 hours (opening on July 21), but longer than Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2 hours and 34 minutes) and The Flash (2 hours and 24 minutes). However, the action is unlike anything any Mission Impossible or Fast and Furious movie has ever delivered before. Seriously, that Rome, Italy car chase will make you want to see the movie again. Paramount is going for a Mission:Impossible franchise five-day record here with a Wednesday start, which is smart given this sequel\u2019s length and the limited amount of showtimes exhibitors can program. Disney did not execute a Wednesday start with Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, another older dude skewing film, the studio opting for a Friday launch and seeing $60.3M over three days before July 4.\n\nThe best reviewed Mission: Impossible of all-time at 98% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, Dead Reckoning is projected to have a $90M five-day stateside, $250M+ worldwide.\n\nLast year, the decades long-awaited sequel Top Gun: Maverick posted the best box office results of Cruise\u2019s career with $19.3M in U.S. previews, $126.7M domestic opening, and $256.4M WW start. The pic finaled at $718.7M domestic (No. 1 pic for 2023 domestic), $1.49 billion WW (No 2 global for 2023 after Avatar: The Way of Water).\n\nMission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout opened to $61.2M domestic, and legged out to $220.1M domestic, and $791.6M WW. Even if Mission comes up short this weekend, remember, Cruise\u2019s movies are always backloaded at the B.O."

    "text": "Tom Cruise\u2018s latest blockbuster \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d is showing strength at the international box office, collecting an impressive $155 million from 70 markets.\n\nAlong with an estimated $80 million at the domestic box office, \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d has grossed $235 million globally through its first five days of release. That\u2019s a mighty worldwide tally, especially for the seventh installment in a 27-year-old action franchise. Imax screens contributed $25 million, including a new franchise-record of $14 million overseas.\n\nThe only trouble is the movie, which finds Cruise\u2019s durable hero Ethan Hunt defying death as he flies off a mountain on his motorcycle, scales a runaway train and maneuvers a tiny car through the bustling streets of Rome, was incredibly expensive to make. Due to COVID-related starts and stops and other pandemic-era safety measures, Paramount and Skydance spent $291 million before marketing costs. So even as Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cBarbie\u201d open on July 21, \u201cDead Reckoning Part One\u201d needs to continue resonating at the global box office to turn a profit in its theatrical run.\n\nThe good news is that \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d movies have a history of overcoming smaller opening weekends at the box office. In 2018, \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout,\u201d for example, collected $61 million domestically to start and ended up setting a series record with $791 million globally. Moreover, \u201cMission\u201d movies tend to earn roughly 70% of overall ticket sales at the international box office. That\u2019ll help offset any trouble at the domestic box office, where \u201cDead Reckoning\u201d is currently behind initial projections.\n\n\u201cMission: Impossible 7\u201d fell short of expectations in China with $25.4 million, which is 66% below \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout\u201d ($74 million). But elsewhere, the film established new franchise opening weekend records in 35 markets, including the United Kingdom ($13.8 million), India ($9 million), Australia ($8.3 million) and New Zealand ($1.5 million). Other top-earning territories were Korea ($14.3 million), France ($7.7 million) and Taiwan ($7.7 million).\n\nChristopher McQuarrie returned to direct the latest installment, which follows Ethan Hunt and his team at the Impossible Mission Force as they work to take down a mysterious, all-powerful artificial intelligence force known as the Entity. Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Esai Morales, Vanessa Kirby and Pom Klementieff round out the cast."

    "text": "Warning: This article contains mild spoilers for Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One.\n\nJulia Roberts could have played a very important part in Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One as one of the brunette women Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) just can't seem to keep alive, no matter how hard he tries.\n\nIn a new Empire Spoiler Special film podcast interview, director/co-writer Christopher McQuarrie revealed he considered casting Roberts and digitally de-aging her to play a role in the flashback scenes that show how Ethan and villain Gabriel (Esai Morales) are connected. In the past, Gabriel murdered Ethan's girlfriend Marie and framed him for her death. In the film, Marie is played by Mariela Garriga, but McQuarrie reveals that he originally wanted to cast a megastar from the time period of the first Mission: Impossible film.\n\nTom Cruise in 'Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One'; Julia Roberts. Paramount Pictures and Skydance; Theo Wargo/Getty Images\n\n\"If you hire Esai Morales and Tom Cruise and de-age them, and then hire some 23-year-old woman to be their confidant in Berlin in 1989, that's bulls---,\" McQuarrie said. \"We started looking at it and saying, 'Who's Marie going to be? Who from that era would Marie have been? It would be Tom in, say, 1989, it would be Tony Scott's Mission: Impossible \u2014 that's who would have been directing the movie before Brian De Palma in that era... I looked back at who was the ingenue, who was the breakout star in 1989? And right around then was Mystic Pizza, and I was like, 'Oh my God. Julia Roberts. A then-pre-Pretty Woman Julia Roberts as this young woman.'\"\n\nThe director goes on to explain that the only way he \"could have seen doing the sequence justice was to somehow convince Julia Roberts to come in and be this small role at the beginning of this story.\" He originally wanted the flashback scene to be longer as well, but ultimately decided it would be too distracting for audiences to see Roberts, Cruise, Morales, and Henry Czerny (who plays former IMF chief Eugene Kittridge) looking almost 30 years younger via digital de-aging visual effects.\n\n\"The best de-aging I've ever looked at, all I kept thinking is, 'Wow, this de-aging is really good.' I'm in no way, shape, or form connecting to the story,\" he said. \"As you're conceptually going through it, you're like, 'Now all anybody's going to be doing is thinking about the de-aging of Julia Roberts, and Esai, and Tom, and Henry Czerny.'\"\n\nThere was also a much simpler reason why McQuarrie decided against the idea: It cost too much money.\n\n\"I got the bill for de-aging those people before their salaries were even factored into it,\" he said. \"And if you put two of them in a shot together, or three of them in a shot together, it would have been as expensive as the [massive third act action scene set on the] train by the time we were done.\"\n\nMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One is in theaters now.\n\nWant more movie news?

    "text": "DD: Not just one Mission Impossible, but two, the latest Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One with Tom Cruise returning as agent Ethan Hunt in the 7th installment in the series, and Oppenheimer, with Cillian Murphy in Christopher Nolan\u2019s large-screen epic about the race to beat Germany to the atomic bomb in WWII. Our film critic, Harlan Jacobson, ties them together and jumps.\n\nHJ: The film universe is atwitter \u2013 you should pardon the expression--with Barbieheimer, the race between two mass market films, Barbie and Oppenheimer, that are both opening this weekend to chase big numbers at the box office like the old days, pre-everything. At least as interesting is the performance test between Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning and Oppenheimer. Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie and Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer are in their way similar and what the industry needs\u2014fresh auteurist visions where one is light satire with a feminist intent, and the other a dark mea culpa on the use and abuse of male power. But Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning represents the continued uninspired retooling of past franchises \u2013 Bond, Bat, Super and Spiderman, Marvels that are no longer marvels -- that are the default position of risk-averse corporate filmmaking. This is the cancer that was eating away at theatrical attendance 30 years before the pandemic landed theaters in the ICU.\n\nHarlan Jacobson Tom Cruise stars as \"Ethan Hunt\" in Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One\n\nWriter-director Christopher McQuarrie\u2019s Dead Reckoning with Tom Cruise hopping from planes to trains and at least one clown car, and Oppenheimer with the lesser-known Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man who birthed the atom bomb and regretted it even before the fallout rained down, however, are both about missions impossible\u2014to save the planet for good or ill. Oppenheimer, however, is the bet made by visionary filmmaking associated with the great American indie explosion of the early 70s in Marty Scorsese and especially Francis Ford Coppola that the way forward is by investigating the American character, in fiction or in history, to take the pulse of the culture in which we now live.\n\nDead Reckoning did well in its first week out. And given that everyone in the industry, specially during these strike months, is watching the vital signs of both theatres and distributors, that\u2019s a cheering sign if you care about the biz. But the health of the art \u2014 meaningful, fresh character narrative that has Tolstoy\u2019s aspirations to paint the broader moment and David Lean\u2019s imperative to make it big \u2013 lies with Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer, lensed by his cameraman on Tenet, Dunkirk and Interstellar, Hoyte Van Hoytema. It's spirit may lie with American indie filmmaking, but Oppenheimer was made using the elite and expensive cutting edge tech tools of film, crafted by people at the top of their art, with limitless resources backed by a studio, Universal, releasing it in standard film, digital IMAX, and in its best iteration that matches how it was shot on a 70-millimeter IMAX film camera \u2013 shown at a premium price of $26.99 at Loews 68th Street in NYC, one of 19 theaters in the US and 30 worldwide equipped to show it.\n\nNolan\u2019s 12th film \u2013 you may remember his Memento back in 2000 about what we need to remember -- has two principal concerns on its mind: 1) the moral no-man\u2019s land entered by Oppy, the scientist given a sports team nickname when he led the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos to build the atomic bombs dropped on Japan to end the war, and 2) the ensuing security driven fascism of the Communist witch hunt in Congress less than a decade later that destroyed Oppenheimer\u2019s reputation and his career. At three hours and distilled from the 2006 Pulitzer Prize winning 700 -page book, American Prometheus, The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by former Nation columnist Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film\u2019s arc follows Oppenheimer from his days as a university student who was a lab klutz but a good theoretical physics thinker, through his selection to bring the bomb to bear on the war effort, and the multiple layers of tragedy that ensue.\n\nThere are the overlapping politics of university life, military protocols, the war, the post war madness, and the personal dynamics, from marriage to professional egos, that must be threaded and orchestrated on a metronome keyed at first to the German head start on developing a bomb, led by Werner Heisenberg, he of the already famous Heisenberg principle that if you can see it, you\u2019ve altered its nature. Then the metronome of The Red Scare takes over, and we watch Murphy\u2019s 60-foot face trying to reconcile his heartsickness with the inexorable political buzzsaw of petit tyrants coming at him that Sean Connery\u2019s James Bond or Tom Cruise\u2019s Ethan Hunt routinely escape.\n\nThe film is peopled by front rank actors at the top of their power \u2013 Murphy as Oppy, Emily Blunt as his wife Kitty, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr. in a standout turn as Oppy\u2019s Brutus, Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh (as Niels Bohr), David Krumholtz, Bennie Safdie (Edward Teller), Josh Hartnett, Rami Malek, Casey Affleck, Florence Pugh and Gary Oldman as a chameleon Harry Truman. Nolan returns to the screen 80s British leading man Tom Conti as Albert Einstein and Josh Peck, lost since Nickelodeon\u2019s 2004 series, Drake & Josh, as the nervous wreck here who pushes the button at Los Alamos.\n\nNolan\u2019s film positions Oppenheimer to understand the necessity of the project, even as the swirl historically pondered how, especially where and whether to use it. Oppenheimer in Nolan is divided against himself. Even on a screen as large as a football field, there\u2019s a lot of one-on-one ruminations before and after the countdown to the Trinity test blast, which Nolan creates in a fireball, and the ultimate bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki delivered more demurely here over a radio report and newsreel aftermath. Oppenheimer is ultimately ruined as a Communist security risk by Senate investigations shown here that drop out to IMAX in black and white. But how we see him hinges on one line, when he responds to a colleague\u2019s private suggestion that the bomb is so terrible they really ought to keep the Soviets in the loop. The film stops for a beat. \u201cThat would be treason,\u201d Oppenheimer says here, and he\u2019s having none of that. Ergo, chalk up Oppy as another wronged patriot and a man so traumatized by doubt he\u2019s incapable of defending himself in the face of the fascist McCarthy period.\n\nEverything in America always does come down to how Walt Kelly summarized it in Pogo long ago: \u201cWe have met the enemy, and they is us.\u201d This Oppenheimer is brave, ambitious, magnificently accomplished in its filmmaking and on point.\n\nThis 7th in the series of Mission Impossibles, Dead Reckoning, begins in a super stealth Russian sub that yields a lot of dead Russians bobbing up beneath the Arctic ice cap and a two-part, interlocking brass key vital to defeat the enemy and save the planet. The hunt is on! Through two hours and 43 minutes, I never did figure out who the enemy is that Cruise as the returning rogue agent Ethan Hunt is battling. He\u2019s got it going on two fronts: his own CIA on the one hand and on the other what?, who? huh?\n\nIt helps if the times you live in afford an enemy that corresponds to the real world, but here it\u2019s abstracted into a metaphor called The Entity. (How\u2019s that for a screenwriter hedge?) After all the high tech stuff the CIA uses and Cruise abuses in this film, I never did get how the fate of the planet hinges on finding a brass key? I kept thinking that key sure looks like the one my parents used to open a Chinese dry bar (with pearl inlays) that my father bought for our living room in 1958 at the LS Ayres Dept store in Indianapolis and which my brother transferred from my pile to his pile when we closed up the house in Toledo. \u201cEthan, don\u2019t kill yourself, my brother has a key like that on Fullerton Ave in Chicago,\u201d I wanted to shout.\n\nNo worries, as Cruise, Hayley Atwell as hot female agent Grace, Ving Rhames as the sidekick and Simon Pegg as the techie, engage in a millisecond by millisecond never-ending pitched battle with The Entity, transversing the globe to do chop-socky stunts on the roof of a speeding train, a slap-stick shift tear through Rome in a circus yellow Fiat 500, and leaps of faith over rooftops in Venice and the Swiss Alps and across the sands of Abu Dhabi in a mission that plays out as really quite possible after all to save the world. Yes, Tom Cruise is a Unicorn, as my son calls him. And as with all franchise victories, Carvel Cone afterwards.\n\nI'm Harlan Jacobson"

    "text": "Tom Cruise, the star who is credited with saving the box office after Top Gun: Maverick flew to $1.5 billion in global ticket sales, is now facing another kind of reckoning \u2014 surviving the Barbenheimer effect.\n\nHis Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One tumbled a franchise-worst 64 percent to $19.5 million in its second weekend when going up against Barbie and Oppenheimer, whose dual arrivals transformed into a cultural phenomenon and propelled the domestic box office to historic heights. Revenue for the July 21-23 weekend was the fourth-biggest of all time; in addition, it was the first time ever that one movie opened to $100 million or more and another to $50 million or more. Barbie scored $155 million, followed by $80.5 million for Oppenheimer. No one in Hollywood anticipated such a staggering turnout.\n\nThe seventh installment in Paramount and Skydance\u2019s storied Mission: Impossible series, which finished Sunday with a domestic total of $118.8 million, had hoped to earn as much as $25 million in its second outing.\n\nThe question now is whether Dead Reckoning Part One can level out and enjoy a long run as other series installments have done, and just as Cruise\u2019s Top Gun: Maverick did. Executives across Hollywood, and not just at Paramount, aren\u2019t ruling Dead Reckoning out just yet, especially since it has a better critics\u2019 score on Rotten Tomatoes than Barbie and Oppenheimer, as well as strong audience exit scores.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the story has yet been written,\u201d says one executive at a rival studio.\n\nMission: Impossible pics have never sported mega-openings, yet expectations were high for Dead Reckoning after Cruise\u2019s Top Gun: Maverick opened to $160.5 million over Memorial Day weekend in 2022, including $126.7 million for the three days. Dead Reckoning had been tracking to open to $90 million in its first five days beginning July 12; instead, it took in a franchise-best $78.5 million, not adjusted for inflation.\n\nTitles in the Mission franchise have always drawn a larger percentage of their global gross from the foreign box office. Dead Reckoning Part One is no exception. It earned another $55 million from 72 markets in its second weekend for a foreign tally of $252.1 million and $370.9 million globally through Sunday. It is doing especially well in Asia, where Barbie and Oppenheimer aren\u2019t strong players. And in a number of markets, it is pacing 15 percent or more ahead of 2018\u2019s Mission: Impossible \u2014 Fallout. In Japan, it debuted to $7.9 million, 23 percent ahead of Fallout, which earned a franchise-best $571.5 million overseas for a global total of $791.7 million, including $220.2 million in North America.\n\nMission: Impossible 7 had to contend with losing Imax screens for three weeks to Oppenheimer, in addition to losing premium large-format screens to both Oppenheimer and Barbie. The upcharge for Imax and PLFs is significant and can have a big impact on the bottom line. In early July, Imax screens were dedicated to Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.\n\nCruise\u2019s latest movie, directed by Christopher McQuarrie, cost nearly $300 million to produce and saw its release date delayed numerous times because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was initially set to open in summer of 2021, then summer or fall of 2022. Its release date ultimately landed on mid-July of this year, a date dictated by the shooting schedule of Dead Reckoning Part Two and Cruise\u2019s availability to promote Part One (the actor is known for his global marketing efforts).\n\nAdds another observer: \u201cBarbenheimer siphoned off MI7\u2032s potential this weekend, with Oppenheimer drawing older males away from Dead Reckoning. Not only that, Sound of Freedom is an unexpected force to be reckoned with and is presenting competition from an unlikely source.\u201d\n\nEstimates for the U.S. box office show Angel Studios\u2019 faith-based political thriller Sound of Freedom beating Dead Reckoning for the weekend with $20.1 million for a cume of $123.4 million (Sound of Freedom opened July 4), according to Comscore. Paramount and other studios show Dead Reckoning beating Sound of Freedom; Monday actuals will determine the order.\n\nMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part Two is set to open in theaters June 28, 2024. McQuarrie and Cruise have shot much of the movie, but production is now halted because of the SAG-AFTRA strike in another moment of reckoning for the storied action franchise.\n\nThings looked different in late June, when Cruise \u2014 Hollywood\u2019s highest-profile advocate for the theatrical experience \u2014 urged audiences to see Dial of Destiny. And, yes, two other movies in a surprisingly effective plea. Wrote the actor on Instagram : \u201cI love a double feature, and it doesn\u2019t get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie.\u201d"

    "text": "In 2013, when Hayley Atwell took the stage for Trafalgar Studios\u2019 production of The Pride, she had no idea that future co-architect of the Mission: Impossible franchise, Christopher \u201cMcQ\u201d McQuarrie, was in attendance. Atwell had already read for McQ and Tom Cruise\u2019s 2012 film, Jack Reacher, but on this particular occasion, McQ was so gobsmacked by her live performance that he took the actor out to dinner and stated his intentions to write a role for her someday. Well, someday became 2019, as McQ and Cruise needed a new leading lady to play Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One\u2019s master thief, Grace.\n\nAtwell has waited over 17 years for an opportunity like this in a blockbuster film. Yes, she\u2019s played the fan-favorite Peggy Carter at least a half-dozen times in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but her big screen opportunities were almost always in service of another character\u2019s story, that of Steve Rogers/Captain America. In Dead Reckoning Part One, Atwell is finally at the center of a tentpole feature, and that is evident when Grace gets the better of Cruise\u2019s Ethan Hunt multiple times during the first half of the film.\n\n\u201cI was finally given the trust and the platform \u2026 to show more range and to show more emotional depth in a franchise or something of this size, which I hadn\u2019t been afforded before,\u201d Atwell tells The Hollywood Reporter in a conversation conducted ahead of the SAG-AFTRA strike. \u201cAnd so I have this eternal gratitude to Tom and to McQ, who provided the resources and the support system every day on set so that I could thrive. It\u2019s been a deliverance of a long time coming. After 17 years in this industry, I\u2019ve finally been able to do something at this level, with this quality of filmmaking, and I\u2019d never been afforded that before.\u201d\n\nIn a production filled with indelible moments, Atwell will never forget a rainy day in Rome, where she drifted during a car chase, all while Cruise was handcuffed to her.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s about 20 minutes of footage of us [drifting] over and over again,\u201d Atwell says. \u201cAnd then Tom led a round of applause from the crew, and McQ said, \u2018Tom put his life in your hands just then and he wouldn\u2019t have allowed you to do that had he not believed that you could look after him, too.\u2019 So they\u2019re never short on their praise for when actors come in and deliver for them. That\u2019s a moment I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d\n\nBelow, during a conversation with THR, Atwell also discusses Grace\u2019s real name and backstory, before previewing Dead Reckoning Part Two\u2019s Arctic location in Svalbard, Norway.\n\nSo, if I recall correctly, McQ was impressed by your work in a play after you were already in the mix for Jack Reacher, and he\u2019s kept you in mind ever since. Is that the basic origin story?\n\nThat\u2019s correct, yes. McQ saw me in The Pride in Trafalgar Studios about ten years ago. He took me out for dinner after and said, \u201cThat thing you did on that stage, I want it. I want to bottle it. I don\u2019t know what the character or story would be \u2026\u201d So he\u2019s never forgotten it, and he quoted back a line to me from The Pride the other day. It\u2019s like, \u201cWow, it really stayed with him.\u201d The character is overcome with this really difficult period in life, and she just says, \u201cAll that wasted time.\u201d And so he said it to me. McQ is a really good actor. He\u2019s very engaging. He delivered it in such a beautiful, emotional way, and it took me right back to that moment.\n\nHayley Atwell and Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One Courtesy of Paramount Pictures and Skydance\n\nAs a highly trained actor, how did you take to a process where the story and the character are still in flux throughout production?\n\nI think my classical training allowed me to surrender to the process of it, without sounding too arty. When you do a degree of three years, you\u2019re trying out lots of different things and failing on a daily basis, or at least you\u2019re feeling like you are. You\u2019re taking lots of risks and you don\u2019t know what skill set you have. You\u2019re still honing in that toolkit. So it put me in good stead of having a work ethic, and if I trust the filmmakers I\u2019m working with to only put into the movie the thing that\u2019s gonna serve the story, then there\u2019s a freedom in it and I can try lots of different things.\n\nWith Grace, I really wanted her to be more than one thing, because we are all more than one thing. She has her moments of self-assurance and then self-doubt, and courage and then fear, in the face of these high stakes. So that sense of not knowing, that hypervigilance, is with her throughout, and I just felt like I could ground her and give her a bit more depth than just relying on the physical visual spectacle that we were creating.\n\nSo there\u2019s footage of the cast watching Tom\u2019s motorcycle jump on day one, and almost everybody started laughing once he went over the edge. Was the laughter a way to cope with the sheer terror of what he was doing?\n\nI think it was just the exasperation. We\u2019d heard about this, and we\u2019d seen him in preparation and training for it. We\u2019d seen the engineers design and build that ramp at that location. We\u2019d seen him that morning jump off the helicopter over that precipice to test the wind, and so the laughter came out of just awe. A man was risking his life for the movie and to delight his audiences. I actually laughed more once I\u2019d heard that the canopy had successfully been deployed and he\u2019d made it back to the ground. I laughed even harder when the first words out of his mouth were something like, \u201cOkay, I think I can go further off the motorbike.\u201d He was immediately giving himself notes about how to do it better next time. He was like, \u201cOkay, yep. We got that one. Let\u2019s move on.\u201d So the sheer dedication to craft and to entertain just takes your breath away.\n\nHayley Atwell and Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One Courtesy of Paramount Pictures and Skydance\n\nHayley, you are the only person in recorded history who\u2019s experienced a car chase in Rome while handcuffed to Tom Cruise.\n\n(Laughs.)\n\nSo, what do you want the history books to know about this experience?\n\nThat being outside of your comfort zone can lead to very unexpected beautiful things if you trust your scene partner and if you\u2019ve done the preparation that it takes to be able to put yourself in a situation like that, not only to do it safely, but also to be able to throw out different performances. And Tom, as we all know, is so diligent in his preparation and his discipline, and that becomes very contagious for me to want to also meet him at those intense places. I also knew that there was this huge safety net there and that he\u2019s not reckless, so we were able to have fun with it.\n\nEthan pulls her file and then extrapolates as to what Grace\u2019s likely backstory is, and I loved the way you played that moment with this almost prideful look on your face. Do you think he was right on the money?\n\nYeah, it helped me a lot, because I\u2019d already started shooting before they\u2019d written that scene. So I wasn\u2019t sure exactly about the backstory that they would give her, and I\u2019m really pleased that they did say that she\u2019s an orphan. Her need for survival turned her into an opportunist and someone who wanted nice things, \u201cother people\u2019s things,\u201d because she hadn\u2019t come from any sort of privilege or luxury. And I thought, \u201cOkay, that makes sense for the choices that she makes and the way that she changes the plot and pulls the rug from underneath his feet.\u201d She\u2019s not doing that because she enjoys watching other people suffer. She\u2019s doing it because she has a very strong need to survive and be hyper independent in the world.\n\nI know this is an action franchise, but I do try to work out a psychological profile for a character I\u2019m playing, so I can root her in something that often comes from a core wound. And I thought, \u201cWell, how great,\u201d because it shows me there in that moment that if human beings are wired for connection, then that is the reason why we can survive our attachment to our primary caregivers or the world that we are born into. But if she can\u2019t do that, then she\u2019s very fearful of other people. She can\u2019t trust them. Maybe she\u2019s been betrayed by them, and so out of that comes why she does the things she does. And I thought, \u201cThey\u2019ve hit the nail on the head of being able to have the audience not despise her or dislike her for all the things she does,\u201d particularly to Ethan at the beginning of the movie. You go, \u201cOkay, so she comes from that perspective. That makes more sense.\u201d It\u2019s a more humane way as to why she does the thing she does.\n\nWhen Ethan asks for her name, she says, \u201cHow about Grace?\u201d which implies that it\u2019s not her real name. I think you can actually see a few letters of her real name on a passport later in the film. [Writer\u2019s Note: \u201cFr Mar\u201d is visible on the third-act passport.] But do you know her real name yet?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until after we finished filming and McQ had inserted a closeup of this passport where you do see those couple of names, that he sent me the name and some backstory about the name and where it came from. And I thought, \u201cOh, that\u2019s such a good Easter egg.\u201d And who knows if that is another alias? But I think it\u2019s probably gonna be explored more in Part Two. Their attention to detail when it comes to little things like that is really fun for an actor. It\u2019s also fun for the fans to be able to go back and go, \u201cOh, that moment was planted early on.\u201d It\u2019s a lovely callback and shows the attention that McQ as a filmmaker puts into things that seem, on the surface, as sweeping visual delight and spectacle. He\u2019s put a lot of thought into each of the characters\u2019 lives, and I love that.\n\nIn Venice, there\u2019s a moment where Ethan says, \u201cYour life will always matter more to me than my own,\u201d and it cuts to Grace, who has tears in her eyes that are on the verge of falling. Did you play it as her being moved by Ethan\u2019s words, or were the tears a residual effect of recent tragedy?\n\nAt the time, we did lots of variations where she\u2019s still defiant and still unwilling to trust him. She\u2019s coming into this world where she would have to give up the independence that she has not only enjoyed, but also depended on to survive. And so I knew that would be a very emotionally conflicting moment for her. In retrospect, where we ended up taking it is that deep down, whether she\u2019s aware of it or not, that\u2019s something she\u2019s always wanted to hear from another human being. It\u2019s the idea that someone else has got her back, without an agenda. She says, \u201cYou don\u2019t even know me,\u201d so she\u2019s definitely not earned that from him by that point at all. But deep down, she really wants that relief of having someone look out for her.\n\nAlso, the cost now of caring about another human being and being cared for is a lot for her to take, because the cost of caring and trusting someone for the first time means the risk of losing that person or being betrayed by them. So, in that moment, she\u2019s just on the verge of really wanting to believe that it\u2019s real, because it\u2019s something that she\u2019s always wanted. So when she says, \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll be on that train,\u201d I feel like later it\u2019s her going, \u201cWhen you said your life wouldn\u2019t be more to me than my own, I need you now to prove it.\u201d\n\nSo, don\u2019t get me wrong, you\u2019ve had some amazing moments in Marvel movies, but I\u2019ve honestly always felt like there was some untapped potential there, something McQ has now fulfilled in Mission. You\u2019re as active as you\u2019ve ever been and you show a wide range of your abilities. So do you feel like this is the centerstage moment you\u2019ve been waiting for in a blockbuster film?\n\nYes. (Laughs.) On this level, yeah. I\u2019ve had plays or productions that I\u2019ve done in London, which, of course, is to a live audience, and so it\u2019s not lived beyond the performance that night. It\u2019s not immortalized on camera. But yeah, I feel this sense that I was finally given the trust and the platform to do lots of different things and to show more range and to show more emotional depth in a franchise or something of this size, which I hadn\u2019t been afforded before. And so I have this eternal gratitude to Tom and to McQ, who saw it in me and provided the resources and the support system every day on set so that I could thrive. They are generous enough to let me try and find my own way through this, without pigeonholing her as one thing, and it feels like it\u2019s been a deliverance of a long time coming. After 17 years in this industry, I\u2019ve finally been able to do something at this level, with this quality of filmmaking, and I\u2019d never been afforded that before.\n\nHayley Atwell and Esai Morales in Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One Courtesy of Paramount Pictures and Skydance\n\nAs AI and the ongoing attack against truth became more and more relevant this year, both issues served as real-life character development for your big bad, The Entity. So, what was the internal response to this real-life and real-time development of your villain?\n\nThe idea was brought very early on into production meetings, and my understanding of the story from the beginning was that it was this unquantifiable force that\u2019s impossible to control. It knows us better than we know our own next move, and it\u2019s faceless, ultimately. And I thought it was clever of [co-writers] Chris [McQuarrie] and Erik [Jendresen] to go, \u201cWell, this makes for the perfect villain with global high stakes. It affects potentially every great power in the world.\u201d So then it becomes a question of what do you do once you get that power? And the fight for that power in whoever possesses this key, they possess a different kind of global power that\u2019s never been seen before, so that changes the trajectory of human beings. And then they grounded it in character, with a messenger of the Entity, played brilliantly by Esai Morales. He has such a charismatic, enigmatic presence on screen that\u2019s chilling. To me, it spoke to the spreading of fake news, unregulated social media and the global powers at play that affect the lives of individuals and communities, and the potential repercussions of all those things. So I thought it felt very apt.\n\nAre you allowed to tease your experience shooting in the Arctic for Part Two?\n\nOnly insomuch as nothing has ever been filmed in the Arctic for a movie of this scale. People thought that it would be impossible, and luckily, Team Mission just came in and totally invalidated that belief system. I can say that the main focus was the safety of the cast and the crew, but also the respect of the landscape out there. The territory feels unowned in a way because it\u2019s so majestic and raw. At times, in minus 55 with a wind chill, having to get action dialogue in that takes a tremendous amount of organization and focus. So how they put that together and weave that into the story, I don\u2019t know, but it will remain the most extraordinary place I\u2019ve ever been on this planet and will probably ever go.\n\nHayley Atwell and Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One Courtesy of Paramount Pictures and Skydance\n\nDecades from now, when you\u2019re reminiscing in front of a crackling fireplace, what day on your Dead Reckoning Part One will you likely recall first?\n\n(Laughs.) It would be drifting in Rome with Tom in the passenger seat, handcuffed to me, with three cameras attached to the windscreen, which impaired my vision. And then it started to rain and the ground was getting wet, which obviously affected the drift. There were stunt cars, and we were beside these very old important monuments. People had come out to watch, and obviously, the crew was watching. I also had to work out whether Tom was speaking to Hayley or Ethan was talking to Grace, when he would say, \u201cSlow down or take a left.\u201d If it was Ethan talking to Grace, she can rebel against exactly what he\u2019s saying and do the opposite. He would also come up with suggestions that he wanted me to try and say, and then we did it. So there\u2019s about 20 minutes of footage of us doing it over and over again, and then stopping to get out and go, \u201cWell, I hope we got some good stuff.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd then Tom led a round of applause from the crew, and McQ said, \u201cTom put his life in your hands just then and he wouldn\u2019t have allowed you to do that had he not believed that you could look after him, too.\u201d And I thought, \u201cWow, that\u2019s generosity and trust from Tom and how hard he\u2019s seen me work to make sure I can do this for him and for the movie.\u201d It was a beautiful surprise to me, because I just thought, \u201cWell, you told me to train really hard to be able to do it. So I did it.\u201d It was a validation because they know what it takes technically, physically, mentally, emotionally to have done that and executed it well. So they\u2019re never short on their praise for when actors come in and deliver for them. That\u2019s a moment I\u2019ll never forget.\n\n***\n\nMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One is now playing in movie theaters. This interview was edited for length and clarity."

    "text": "China\u2019s box office weekend was marked more by the tussle for top spot between \u201cNever Say Never\u201d and \u201cChang An\u201d than the entry of \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One.\u201d The Tom Cruise-starring U.S. blockbuster was the highest new release title, but landed in third place with an opening score of $25.9 million.\n\n\n\nThe weekend\u2019s top-ranked film was \u201cNever Say Never,\u201d a holdover title that scored $46.1 million. Lightchaser Animation-produced \u201cChang An San Wan Li\u201d (aka \u201cChang An 30,000 Miles\u201d) earned a shade less, at $43.9 million, according to data from consultancy Artisan Gateway.\n\n\n\nAfter 11 days of official release (plus substantial previews), \u201cNever Say Never,\u201d written and directed by actor Wang Baoqiang (\u201cLost in Thailand,\u201d \u201cDetective Chinatown\u201d) has already become one of the biggest hits of the year. Its cumulative stands at $212 million. \u201cChang An\u201d has accumulated $96.1 million in nine days.\n\n\n\nLocal data providers\u2019 daily charts showed that \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d never rose above third place despite a wide release on Friday. It played some 98,000 sessions on Friday, but exhibitors cut that on both successive days, ending at 53,000 on Sunday. (Imax reports that some $3.97 million of the film\u2019s China total came from its screens.)\n\n\n\n\u201cNever Say Never\u201d also saw its screen count reduced as cinemas switched their real estate to support \u201cChang An,\u201d despite the latter\u2019s huge 168 -minute running time. \u201cChang An\u201d enjoyed its best day on Sunday, its ninth day of release. The Tang Dynasty-set film mixes history and mythology and is touted as Lightchaser\u2019s first from its New Culture series which are based on actual historical figures.\n\n\n\n\u201cMission Impossible\u201d enjoyed the fourth largest opening haul for a Hollywood movie so far this year. The China launch of \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d is on a par with \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol 3\u201d ($28 million opening and a cumulative of $89 million) but behind \u201cFast X\u201d (opening of $51.1 million and $146 million cumulative) and \u201cTransformers \u2013 Rise of the Beasts\u201d (opening $38.9 million and running total of $96 million).\n\n\n\nSmash hit, \u201cLost in the Stars\u201d earned an additional $15.9 million as it fell to fourth place. It has now earned $474 million since June 22.\n\n\n\nAnother Chinese animation \u201cOh My School\u201d took fifth place in its opening weekend with a $12.8 million. The picture is a body swap comedy involves a naughty pupil and a strict class teacher.\n\n\n\nThe weekend aggregate box office was a healthy $154 million, which propelled the year-to-date total to $4.36 billion. Artisan Gateway calculates that as being some 64% ahead of the same point last year, and only 9% behind that of 2019, the last pre-pandemic year."

    "text": "The testosterone soap opera known as the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise has never been such a welcome sight for its weary fanbase. Few action blockbusters outside of the superhero genre have landed with audiences recently, and in a summer that has seen a slunk in numbers at the box office, Tom Cruise may be just the antidote the industry needs. That doesn't mean that is a perfect installment. In this year's second big-budget, franchise two-parter - it's debatable if this film or left audiences on a higher cliff by film's end - \"Dead Reckoning Part One\" forgoes the sadistic evil mastermind or sociopath seeking utter chaos. Instead, the film makes a bargain with an artificial devil known as The Entity. That's right. Ethan Hunt must harness his greatest assets, use every trick in his chapter book, use every ounce of knowledge and street smarts he can muster, all to face off against... a computer.\n\nIf you're rolling your eyes, it's for good reason. Hunt, an accomplished, well-filmed action hero, has had his fair share of complicated foes. But The Entity, as it's called, will divide audiences more than ever. AI is what keeps most tech junkies up at night these days, and there is reason to believe that such advanced technology could pose a threat to humans one day, but it is certainly an uncinematic opponent, to say the least. Skynet was, at the very least, a figment of the future; the Matrix was born of a dystopian alternative reality. The Entity is operating in the present day, beeping and bopping its way onto all the snarky \"Worst Villains\" lists the internet will inevitably contrive one day. And for good reason. It's a smart chip locked away at the bottom of the ocean, conveniently inaccessible and only destructible with a specific key. It will hardly instill global hysteria. Gabriel (Esai Morales), a mysterious, sinister villain from Hunt's past, enters stage right as a fleshy foe to appease the audience's need for human evil, but even he can't completely distract from The Entity's sometimes hilarious showboating.\n\nTake, for instance, the scene in which Hunt learns exactly what The Entity is. He's crashed a Carnival-type party in Venice where a myriad of dancing guests wear masks and set a scene straight out of The party is hosted by the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), a carryover character known for her constant side-swapping and illegal dealings. The whole crew is gathered around: the White Widow, her entourage, Hunt, his trusty colleague Ilsa (Ferguson), a new acquaintance Grace (Hayley Atwell) whose stealthy pickpocket landed her in a hard drive of hot water (computer jokes really don't land the way you'd hope) and hovering nemesis Gabriel. As vague threats and intimidating glances course through the undercurrent of the dialogue, the final revelation allows a clear understanding: The Entity is everywhere, controlling everything, seeing everyone. It can compute every possible outcome and every imaginable scenario, outthinking and outwitting anyone attempting to stop it. The lights in the large, ancient venue turn an ominous green and flash to personify The Entity's possible evil cackle and to demonstrate its omnipresence.\n\n\n\nStrobe lights! Panning camera shots! The look of realization on Cruise's face as he is surrounded by his body-less nemesis! Muah ha ha ha! It's The Entity!\n\nIt is by and far the film's most laughable sequence and one of the few that feels forced, farcical and calculated, an attempt to instill fear in viewers that would otherwise remain at giga-arm's length. Luckily, \"Dead Reckoning Part One\" has two weapons against audience disbelief and general premise fatigue: Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie. The twosome have been frequent collaborators over the years, with McQuarrie joining the \"Mission: Impossible\" family as director in 2015's ,\" and even though it's been a minute since Cruise last hopped onto his motorcycle for 2018's ,\" they return to the silver screen like no time has passed.\n\nSpeaking of moving vehicles, this film is full of them. The chase sequence through Rome - no you are not imagining it, \"Fast X\" also had an epic car chase through the Eternal City - is particularly fun and demonstrates the physicality and comedic timing that both Cruise and Atwell have mastered in their respective careers. You likely know Cruise's long filmography, but Atwell also has experience in big action flicks, having led a Marvel television series and starred in numerous MCU films as Captain America's significant other and government agent, Peggy Carter. McQuarrie knows how to write an entertaining, outrageous movie that may not have roots in reality, but that carries viewers happily through a saga that won't end (yet). Thankfully, it also doesn't slog like some other recent releases in the genre that have also pushed toward a 3-hour runtime.\n\n\n\nThe Entity won't keep viewers up at night, but the film is wound together by the chemistry between Cruise and his supporting troupe, including longtime castmates Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames and Ferguson, as well as newbie Atwell, whose wise-cracking, emotive performance steals the show. If you can let your inhibitions go out the moving train - yes, there is another moving train and rooftop battle sequence - then \"Dead Reckoning Part One\" will delight. Hunt and crew jetset around the globe, avoiding authorities, sticking the middle finger at government players and, of course, employing hyper-realistic masks, high-tech gadgets and the formidable stunt work that put \"Mission: Impossible\" on the map back in 1996.\n\n\"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\" is in theaters now."

    "text": "Paramount\u2019s \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d is defusing a bit at the domestic box office, readjusting for an estimated $78 million gross over its five-day opening. That\u2019d be a substantial chunk behind projections headed into the weekend, which had the Tom Cruise action sequel hoping for $90 million.\n\nSome in the industry were expecting a \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d halo effect for \u201cDead Reckoning\u201d after last year\u2019s legacy sequel positively ignited movie theaters, rocketing through the summer to become the fifth-highest grossing domestic release of all-time. That doesn\u2019t seem to be the case though, as \u201cMission\u201d isn\u2019t exactly transcending the numbers typical for its franchise.\n\nThe last entry, 2018\u2019s \u201cFallout,\u201d launched with a then-franchise record $61 million over three days. \u201cDead Reckoning\u201d opened on Wednesday, plus previews on Tuesday evening \u2014 a bump-up in the calendar that the industry suspects was implemented to take advantage of premium ticket prices for Imax. Universal and director Christopher Nolan take over those auditoriums next weekend with their sweeping historical drama \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d\n\nTom Cruise may have fostered a reputation as the global vanguard for movie theaters over the past few years \u2014 \u201cI love my popcorn,\u201d he declared in a new video this week \u2014 but it\u2019s worth a reminder that his films aren\u2019t the biggest openers on the block. Instead, they tend to draw older audiences, who are less inclined to roll out for a new release in the first few days. \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d is the star\u2019s superlative multiplier, taking its $126 million three-day debut to a $718 million finish, but \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout\u201d more than tripled its opening weekend, as did the 2015 entry \u201cRogue Nation.\u201d\n\nAs \u201cDead Reckoning\u201d falls behind opening estimates, the franchise will need to find those kinds of legs again. This seventh franchise entry is the most expensive yet \u2014 with a production budget that ballooned to $290 million, not only due to its high-octane set pieces but also a series of COVID-related production delays and safety measures. (\u201cWe are the gold standard!\u201d Cruise shouted at crew members he caught breaking protocols in 2020.) That\u2019s more than $100 million higher than the price tag for \u201cFallout.\u201d\n\nStrong word-of-mouth should be helpful. The \u201cMission\u201d series is now a favorite among critics for its daredevil stunts, intricate set pieces and wry humor. Variety chief film critic Peter Debruge filed a rave for \u201cDead Reckoning,\u201d writing that it \u201cdelivers a formidable concept and several hall-of-fame set-pieces while somehow managing to tie the storylines back into these movies\u2019 core mythology.\u201d He\u2019s far from an outlier, as the film stands with a 92% approval rating from top critics on review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences are also exhilarated, as indicated by the \u201cA\u201d Cinema Score grade determined by surveying ticket buyers.\n\n\u201cMission: Impossible\u201d will also look to register strongly overseas, where the franchise has become a strong draw. Both \u201cFallout\u201d and \u201cRogue Nation\u201d earned more than 70% of their ticket sales in foreign markets. So far, \u201cDead Reckoning\u201d has earned $82.1 million across 70 international territories through its first three days of release.\n\n\u201cDead Reckoning\u201d sees Tom Cruise back as secret agent Ethan Hunt, recruiting his crew of super-spies to take on a very scary and very topical enemy: an all-powerful artificial intelligence called the Entity. Christopher McQuarrie returns to direct after helming the last two entries. Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby and Henry Czerny make series returns, while newcomers Hayley Atwell, Esai Morales, Pom Klementieff, Cary Elwes and Rob Delaney join the fray.\n\nEven with Cruise driving motorcycles off cliffs and chasing criminals around Europe, there is perhaps a more remarkable box office narrative continuing to unfold this weekend. Angel Studios\u2019 \u201cSound of Freedom\u201d continues to show strength as a bona fide word-of-mouth monster. Major studios are projecting a $23 million haul through the weekend \u2014 which would mark a sizable 17% uptick from its gross last weekend.\n\nWide releases hardly ever see week-to-week rises in ticket sales, but \u201cSound of Freedom\u201d isn\u2019t a typical wide release. After being shelved by Disney during the shuffle of the 21st Century Fox acquisition, the Jim Caviezel thriller was eventually taken on by Angel Studios. The Utah-based banner has employed a \u201cPay It Forward\u201d system, encouraging viewers to donate money to the company so that it can purchase and distribute tickets to other prospective audience members looking to see the film at no cost. But a release doesn\u2019t go up in ticket sales just based on an untraditional system \u2014 with its glowing \u201cA+\u201d grade on Cinema Score and lots of chatter on social media, \u201cSound of Freedom\u201d is a phenomenon, particularly among conservative audiences.\n\nThe film, which has been scrutinized by anti-trafficking experts, tells the story of real-life ex-fed Tim Ballard, who left the government to take on human trafficking through his own means. Ballard founded the non-profit Operation Underground Railroad, though he has reportedly parted ways with the organization more recently.\n\nSony\u2019s \u201cInsidious: The Red Door\u201d looks to take third place, projecting a $12.6 million haul through Sunday. That would mark a sizable 62% tumble from its opening last weekend, when the horror sequel debuted on top of domestic charts. The Screen Gems, Stage 6 Films and Blumhouse co-production carries a modest $17 million production budget \u2014 a figure that its $54 million domestic gross has already far surpassed.\n\n\u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\u201d is facing a 59%-or-so drop in its third weekend. The Harrison Ford finale added $3.3 million on Friday, pushing its domestic total to $136 million. The Disney release will soon surpass \u201cFast X\u201d ($145 million) to become one of the top 10 domestic releases of the year; it\u2019d be more remarkable if it weren\u2019t for the film\u2019s whopping $300 million production budget.\n\nDisney also looks to round out the top five with the Pixar romance \u201cElemental.\u201d The animated feature added $2.6 million on Friday, stretching its domestic haul to $119 million. \u201cElemental\u201d bombed upon release, landing Pixar\u2019s lowest opening in history ($29 million), but it has held remarkably well in the weeks since, continuing to draw family crowds. While it won\u2019t recoup its $200 million production budget in North America, things seemed far bleaker just a few weeks ago.\n\nOpening in limited release, Disney is putting out the ensemble comedy \u201cTheater Camp\u201d out under its Searchlight Pictures banner. The indie release, starring Molly Gordon and Ben Platt, looks to capitalize on strong notices out of the Sundance Film Festival. The film is opening in six theaters in Los Angeles and New York, earning $109,000 on Friday."

    "text": "SPOILER ALERT: This story discusses the ending of \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One,\u201d currently playing in theaters.\n\n\u201cDead Reckoning,\u201d the seventh installment of the \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d franchise, is the latest Hollywood blockbuster to be split into two movies, but Tom Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie tried their hardest to give \u201cPart One\u201d a non-cliffhanger conclusion. The filmmaker recently told Total Film magazine that thinking about how to conclude the first of two movies kept Cruise up at night during the filming of \u201cPart One.\u201d\n\nMore from Variety\n\n\u201cWhere we ended the movie was always where we were going to end it,\u201d McQuarrie said of the train action sequence. \u201cHow we ended the movie was a big, big mystery for us. It kept Tom awake at night throughout production. He would come in all the time and say, \u2018This can\u2019t be a cliffhanger, it\u2019s got to be satisfying.\u2019 The audience has to feel a sense of completion.\u201d\n\nMcQuarrie continued, \u201cTom kept looking at that scene, and he had all this anxiety about whether or not it would be a satisfying conclusion or whether it would feel open-ended. We constantly revisited it, constantly refined it.\u201d\n\nUnlike \u201cSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,\u201d which threw moviegoers a curveball by ending on a massive cliffhanger (its second part, \u201cBeyond the Spider-Verse,\u201d arrives in March 2024), \u201cDead Reckoning Part One\u201d ends with Cruise\u2019s Ethan Hunt achieving his immediate goal (he secures the key to unlock the source code of The Entity, the film\u2019s villainous AI program) and Hayley Atwell\u2019s Grace accepting an offer to join the IMF. There are dangling plot threads for \u201cPart Two\u201d to pick up (chief among them being that the film\u2019s human villain, Esai Morales\u2019 Gabriel, is still alive), but at least one mission has reached its definitive end. This is a far more conclusive ending than \u201cSpider-Verse,\u201d which leaves viewers hanging as Miles Morales is stuck in an alternate universe with the Prowler-version of himself.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIf you leave it with a cliffhanger, it feels a little bit like we\u2019re expecting you to come back,\u201d McQuarrie told Total Film. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want that feeling. The feeling we were reaching for \u2014 and we hope you feel \u2014 is we dare you not to come back. We want to leave you thinking, \u2018Oh, I can\u2019t wait to see what happens next.'\u201d\n\n\u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d is now playing theaters nationwide from Paramount Pictures. \u201cPart Two\u201d is set to open on June 28, 2024.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nSign up for Variety\u2019s Newsletter.

    "text": "This interview took place before SAG-AFTRA strike activity.\n\nWhile villains typically tend to be unanimously reviled characters \u2014 from Scar and Pennywise to Hannibal Lecter \u2014 the best actors find a way to make even the worst bad guys likable. In the seventh installment of Tom Cruise\u2019s Mission: Impossible series (Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One, currently in theaters), Pom Klementieff plays the fiery Paris, whose sole directive is to sabotage everybody else\u2019s efforts (by all means necessary \u2014 and we mean all means) to retrieve a key that unlocks an all-powerful artificial intelligence nicknamed \"The Entity.\"\n\nAnd yet, the audience can\u2019t help but fall in love with the rambunctious French firecracker, whose grunge-inspired outfits, platinum bob haircut, and intricate fight sequences make her the film\u2019s resident cool girl.\n\n\u201cShe's on a path of destruction and you're still rooting for her, like, \u2018I love this girl,\u2019\u201d Klementieff tells InStyle about her character, a Harley Quinn type who drops roundhouse kicks in plaid miniskirts and runs a military-grade tank through the tourist-filled streets of Venice, Italy, with a maniacal smile on her face. Her character is a woman of few words, relying on action and fashion to speak for her, which Klementieff calls \u201cfreeing, because it was just all about behavior and all about just movement.\u201d\n\nShe also says she drew inspiration from iconic silent characters of the past, played by some of the greats like Clint Eastwood, Japanese comedian Takeshi Kitano, and French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo.\n\n\u201cBut the beauty of it is that when she speaks, everyone listens,\u201d she adds.\n\nKlementieff is no stranger to the genre, with a stacked r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that includes high-action projects like Thunder Force (starring Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer) and Guardians of the Galaxy. Although Paris is a far cry from her beloved Marvel character Mantis, likability is something Klementieff excels at bringing to her characters both good and bad. She also appeared as Haeng-Bok in Spike Lee's 2013 mystery Old Boy alongside Josh Brolin, Elizabeth Olsen, Samuel L. Jackson, and Michael Imperioli.\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nThe latest installment of the wildly popular franchise \u2014 which also marks the series\u2019s second-to-last volume (Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part 2 is slated to hit theaters next summer) \u2014 delivers all the makings of the espionage franchise that loyal fans have come to know and love: action-packed scenes, over-the-top fight sequences, and the thrill of taking on things that are, well, impossible.\n\n\u201cIt was such an honor to join this franchise,\u201d Klementieff gushes. \u201cI've been a fan since I was a child, so I saw all the other movies so many times. It was just incredible to get to work on this movie and to work with Tom and McQ [director Christopher McQuarrie].\u201d\n\nBut this film is also sure to draw in a whole new generation with its reinvented approach to the spy movie, which weaves together modern technological advancements (we\u2019re talking an AI entity that has the world\u2019s superpowers clamoring for control), moments of comedic relief, a whirlwind romance, and a set of new characters, like Paris and Grace (played by fellow Marvel alumnae Hayley Atwell). Even moviegoers who aren\u2019t die-hard Mission: Impossible fans can prepare to be captivated for the film\u2019s entire 2 hour and 43 minute run, which seems long, but is stacked with exciting content from start to finish. In other words, it\u2019s quite literally a movie that feels like a real movie (thank you, Harry Styles, for these profound words) and deserves to be experienced in theaters.\n\n\u201cThere's some lightness to it and there's drama. Sometimes it's rom-com, sometimes it's film noir. It's so many things at the same time,\u201d Klementieff says, explaining the film\u2019s diverse landscape. \u201cI think this movie is so rich, it feels like several movies at the same time in several genres at the same time. There's also some very charming and funny moments, right? With Ethan [Cruise] and Grace. as well, you see a comedy that you haven't seen in the previous movies.\u201d\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nUnlike the majority of action movies, M:I 7 taps into current style trends for costuming (something for the fashion girlies) \u2014 especially when it comes to Paris and her punk-rock aesthetic. Klementieff worked with the movie\u2019s costume designer, Jill Taylor, to develop something \u201cfresh and different\u201d for the rebellious character while also keeping her \u201cgrounded\u201d during her intense action sequences.\n\n\u201cWe're going to bring something different for this character, some vibe that was a little bit more punk, which is cool to do, because I think it was really different from the other female characters from the franchise,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat was very important to me is that she was not wearing heels because she knows she's going to fight, so wearing heels just doesn't make sense.\u201d\n\nDuring one scene, Paris, along with everyone else searching for the coveted key, attends a party at a nightclub in Venice. Paris\u2019s makeup look, which included a drawn-on white mask with a black teardrop, was influenced by the 17th century pantomime staple Pierrot from the commedia dell'arte.\n\n\u201cIt's kind of cute but creepy at the same time,\u201d she said describing Paris\u2019s less-than-incognito ensemble. \u201c[There\u2019s] something melancholic about the teardrop that really connected with the character, that made sense.\u201d\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nKlementieff admits that her style IRL isn\u2019t that entirely different from her latest on-screen persona. \u201dMy style is eclectic and it depends on the mood, but for everyday, of course it's going to be more relaxed and more chill. But, for events I like to have fun and just take risks.\u201d\n\nThe actress arrived at the movie\u2019s Seoul, South Korea, premiere in a head-turning strapless leather gown made from motorcycle gear (found by her stylist Jonathan Huguet), which she paired with platform boots and a slicked-back hairdo that included nail embellishments, executed by her hairstylist Marcia Lee.\n\n\u201cIt's fun to do things that are unexpected, go from one vibe to another, and not take it too seriously,\u201d she says. \u201cLife is short and you want to have a good time too, so I do that with fashion, as well.\u201d\n\nMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part 1 is in theaters now."

Angel Studios\u2019 relentless Sound of Freedom ($151.3M), 4) Disney/Lucasfilm\u2019s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny ($143.9M), 5) Paramount/Skydance\u2019s Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning \u2013 Part One ($140.4M), 6) Sony/Blumhouse\u2019s Insidious: The Red Door ($78.5M), 7) Disney/Pixar\u2019s Elemental ($64.6M), 8) Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse ($47.1), 9) Disney\u2019s Haunted Mansion ($26.4M) and 10) Sony\u2019s No Hard Feelings ($26.1M).\n\nWith the SAG-AFTRA strike already pushing big movies like Kraven the Hunter, Challengers and the next Ghostbusters out of 2023, and exhibition fearing a downturn at the B.O. come October should the actors\u2019 sit-out continue, the guild\u2019s National Executive Director and Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland told Deadline yesterday that despite that harsh impact, \u201cwe have to take a strong line.\u201d\n\nWhile a supporter of exhibition, Crabtree-Ireland acknowledged that the sector is \u201cobviously very challenged\u201d however \u201cwe can\u2019t allow theatrical exhibition to become a way that the studios are sort of fueling their businesses during our strike.\u201d"

    "text": "Warning: This article contains spoilers for Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One.\n\nThe most shocking event which occurs in Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One is arguably not the sight of Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt riding a motorbike off a cliff, but rather the death of Hunt's friend and fellow spy Ilsa Faust, a major part of the franchise since 2015's Mission: Impossible \u2013 Rogue Nation. Portrayed by Rebecca Ferguson, Faust is killed on a Venice bridge by Esai Morales' villainous Gabriel while Hunt runs (of course!) through the Italian city, arriving too late to help her.\n\nIn a new podcast interview with Empire, the film's director and co-writer Christopher McQuarrie discusses why he and Cruise, who produced the movie with McQuarrie, felt the need to kill off Ferguson's character.\n\nRebecca Ferguson in 'Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One'. Paramount Pictures and Skydance\n\n\"It was one of the earliest conversations. We were on the set of Top Gun, we were already talking about it,\" says the filmmaker, referring to last year's Joseph Kosinski-directed Top Gun: Maverick, which McQuarrie co-wrote. \"We knew that that emotional arc was of a certain emotional tone... Ilsa is a wonderful character, and a character of which I am enormously proud, and Rebecca is an actor of such unmitigated power and presence.\"\n\nHe continued, \"And yet, where we had gone with the character from Rogue to Fallout...[the] place you took that character would either make less of her, it would suddenly become frivolous... or she would just become a romantic interest, and it was never about creating a character who was defined by her love story with Ethan Hunt. Their relationship transcends a traditional loving story... They're doomed to be together and yet doomed never to be together... It felt like that story was looking for its resolution and so we said this has got to happen.\"\n\nMcQuarrie goes on to explain that his and Cruise's decision to conclude Faust's story dovetailed with their desire to give a sense of genuine stakes to the movie.\n\n\"What really needs to happen in the story is the stakes have to be real, they can't be implied,\" says the director. \"We have to have the courage to let [Ethan] fail and it has to cost, the mission has to cost, and without that, the villain simply will not have a threat\u2026what you're seeing in the escalation of the story is what it costs Ethan personally in Venice.\"\n\nWhen asked if the pair had considered the possibility of killing off Simon Pegg's Benji Dunn or Ving Rhames' Luther Stickell, the director said \"we explored them all\" before ominously pointing out that the recent film is, after all, just Part One of the tale.\n\nWant more movie news?

    "text": "It\u2019s 10 a.m. in Sydney, where Hayley Atwell is preparing to walk the red carpet as the \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d crew\u2019s newest member, joining producer and star Tom Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie\u2019s ensemble of battle-hardened actors.\n\n\u201cThis is a pure cinematic experience. It\u2019s unadulterated entertainment, and of a huge scale,\u201d Atwell says to Variety about \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One,\u201d which finally hit theaters on July 12 following a two-year delay caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFlashy events like the Australia premiere (which featured a fireworks spectacle in honor of Cruise\u2019s 61st birthday on July 3) mark the end of a four-year odyssey that pushed Atwell\u2019s limits physically \u2014 leaving her hanging inside a train car that\u2019s gone from horizontal to vertical, gripping anything nailed to the floor/wall/ceiling lest she fall to her death (or at least the safety rigging below) \u2014 and saw her creating a cunning character within the \u201cM:I\u201d universe.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m aware that this is entertainment,\u201d Atwell adds. \u201cBut I\u2019m also aware that my responsibility as an actor is to contribute in my own small way to the kind of characters I want to see represented.\u201d\n\nAtwell plays Grace, a professional thief who becomes embroiled in Ethan Hunt\u2019s (Cruise) latest impossible mission \u2014 tracking down a rogue artificial intelligence system. Among its various plotlines, \u201cDead Reckoning Part One\u201d chronicles Grace\u2019s origins, explaining how the pickpocket becomes an integral part of the narrative.\n\nShe\u2019s seen the movie four times, the first at a screening for the cast and crew, with her mother as her plus one (and Cruise watching her mum instead of the screen to gauge her enjoyment.) So, what did mum make of the movie?\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very vocal and effusive when it comes to the big action sequences. She\u2019s like, \u2018Oh my God, why didn\u2019t you tell me you\u2019re doing that?\u2019\u201d says Atwell, who quipped: \u201cBecause you would have been really nervous for me.\u201d\n\nThe death-defying stunt work aside, Atwell\u2019s mother also shared a poignant takeaway. \u201cShe recognizes the grounding that I\u2019ve done with Grace, of giving her emotional depth,\u201d Atwell shares. \u201cShe could see that I was able to hold my own with my own experience of being in this industry and bringing truth to the role.\u201d\n\nTom Cruise and Hayley Atwell in \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One.\u201d Paramount Pictures and Skydance\n\nThe British American actor joins the IMF from the MCU, where she played Margaret \u201cPeggy\u201d Carter for more than a decade. Over the course of six movies and the ABC series \u201cAgent Carter,\u201d Peggy rose through the ranks to lead the government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. \u2014 challenging misogyny in the workplace with the same verve she nabbed supervillains. Plus, Peggy represents one half of the multiverse\u2019s most enduring romance, as the first love of Steve Rogers a.k.a. Captain America (Chris Evans).\n\nThere\u2019s really no comparison between Marvel and \u201cMission,\u201d Atwell says. It\u2019s really apples and oranges \u2014 or more specifically akin to performing Kenneth Lonergan\u2019s adaptation of \u201cHowards End\u201d versus starring in Henrik Ibsen\u2019s \u201cRosmersholm\u201d on the West End.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just so distinctively themselves \u2014 a different group of filmmakers, different tastes, different character, different worlds,\u201d she explains. \u201cThey just happen to be things that have become global phenomena.\u201d\n\nYet there\u2019s a bridge that carries Atwell from one franchise to the other: the way she personified both women.\n\n\u201cWhat I tried to do with Peggy \u2014 and I think it\u2019s the reason I got the part in \u2018Mission\u2019 \u2014 I didn\u2019t play her like I was in a superhero film. And with Grace, I\u2019m not playing her like I\u2019m in an action film,\u201d Atwell notes. \u201cPeggy taught me that I can be distinctively grounded in a character that\u2019s going to stand out, rather than get consumed by the machine of something.\u201d\n\nA \u201cMission\u201d movie is not your typical Hollywood machine. For starters, there\u2019s no set script, so Atwell developed Grace from the ground up alongside Cruise and McQuarrie. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like I was having to fit into a character that they\u2019d created,\u201d she explains, \u201cbecause they hadn\u2019t actually created one.\u201d\n\nEach scene offered an opportunity to add nuance and subvert any action movie stereotypes about \u201cstrong\u201d women. \u201cI thought, well, it\u2019s an opportunity here to do many different takes\u201d on the character, Atwell says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want her to seem that she was just trying to look cool, or femme fatale, or a sex object.\u201d\n\nShe sees Grace\u2019s motivation as one driven by some deep wound that\u2019s caused the character to be distrustful of others and retreat from society. \u201cSomething\u2019s got to have happened to her to interrupt the very deep human need that we all have to belong \u2014 whether it\u2019s to our family, our social group, or some sort of tribe, or workforce that gives us a sense of identity,\u201d she reasons, pinpointing why Grace can be \u201cunpredictable, untrustworthy and inconsistent.\u201d\n\nIn a recent interview with The Telegraph, Atwell revealed that at age 13 she wrote letters to her 40-year-old self \u2014 Atwell is 41 \u2014 questioning what her life would be like. She shared that teenage Hayley would\u2019ve been thrilled to learn she\u2019d booked a \u201cM:I\u201d movie. But the teen would\u2019ve had a big question: \u201cWere you able to push the conversation forward about female representation in a franchise of this size?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe answer to that query is \u201cYes,\u201d Atwell tells Variety, explaining that the mission she undertook with Grace was \u201cto allow her and give her the platform to be more than one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cDead Reckoning\u201d features an abundance of female characters: Rebecca Ferguson plays Ilsa Faust, a former MI6 agent turned IMF ally; Vanessa Kirby as black-market arms dealer Alanna Mitsopolis, a.k.a the White Widow; and fellow franchise-newcomer Pom Klementieff as the sociopathic assassin Paris.\n\n\u201cAll the characters are so distinctive, and that\u2019s what\u2019s great,\u201d Atwell says. \u201cThey\u2019re never all one thing \u2014 they all come in with their own agendas and their own ideas about who they are and what they want to be and what they want to do to affect people in the scene. Any one of them could have a spin-off and collectively, too.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s striking to see all four share the screen in one particularly tense scene \u2014 further demonstrating that their roles are additive, not competitive.\n\n\u201cWomen in this franchise aren\u2019t pitted against each other,\u201d Atwell notes, adding that, \u201cIt\u2019s a false assumption that that\u2019s how it has to be, and probably more to do with a comment on the culture of celebrity that does seem to pit women against each other in a \u2018Who wore it best?\u2019 situation. But that mindset is not a creative act.\u201d\n\nHayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, Vanessa Kirby and Christopher McQuarrie on the set of \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One.\u201d Christian Black\n\nOn the topic of female representation, Atwell often recalls a line from art critic John Berger\u2019s \u201cWays of Seeing\u201d: \u201cMen act, and women appear. Men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at.\u201d Those words, Atwell says, have been true to her experience as an actor, and what she believes to be true for many women in the public eye. She wanted \u201cMission\u201d to be different.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to feel that Grace is aware that she\u2019s being looked at. I want to see what Grace is looking at,\u201d Atwell says. \u201cShe\u2019s in a world that\u2019s over her head, but she\u2019s in a hypervigilant state of trying to work out how to navigate it, and how to survive through it.\u201d\n\nThus, Grace employs her sense of humor and other tactics like flirtation to get where she needs to go. \u201cShe can duck, dive and disappear, or she can call Ethan Hunt a \u2018pervert\u2019 publicly in order to escape him,\u201d Atwell says, giggling at the character\u2019s cheekiness in one key moment.\n\nAnd since physical prowess is a prerequisite for the franchise, Atwell also underwent five months of stunt training, so she was ready to improvise whenever a scene required it. She experimented with different disciplines of mixed martial arts, worked on sleight of hand tricks and pickpocketing (the latter which she\u2019s \u201cterrible\u201d at because she\u2019s \u201can awful liar\u201d) and learned to drift in a race car.\n\nOne day, while training, stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood handed her two knives to hold while practicing a trapping and grappling sequence. Turns out, Atwell could do her moves faster with the addition of the prop weapons.\n\n\u201cI think it comes from theater \u2013 I love working with props on a stage because you can convey so much and they\u2019re an extension of your character,\u201d she says, letting her inner theater nerd geek out. \u201cThe way that you stir a cup of tea can tell how much you hate someone you\u2019re talking to, or that you\u2019re trying to seduce them.\u201d\n\nTraining for a \u201cM:I\u201d movie is like a boot camp, but it\u2019s not about the aesthetics. It\u2019s about building a different kind of strength and Hayley has the bruises to prove it. \u201cAt the time that I came to set, my body was fit for purpose,\u201d Atwell says.\n\nPart of that purpose was developing the shorthand between herself and Cruise so that Grace and Ethan could create an \u201celegant physicality\u201d when handcuffed together. The duo also brushed up on their classic cinema, watching 70s heist movies like \u201cPaper Moon\u201d and \u201cThe Sting,\u201d as well as \u201cThe Thomas Crown Affair,\u201d \u201cTo Catch a Thief\u201d and \u201cBringing Up Baby\u201d to build a library of references to pull from tonally.\n\nHayley Atwell and Tom Cruise in \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning \u2013 Part One\u201d Christian Black\n\n\u201cWhen they\u2019re sort of do-si-doing around the car with each other, there is this sense that these two people who are exasperated by each other share an origin story and are naturally working together whether they realize it or not,\u201d Atwell explains.\n\nDuring the car chase scene, Atwell was not only tasked with drifting the car while handcuffed to Cruise, but also taking performance notes from McQuarrie about adjusting Grace\u2019s reaction to the circumstances. Add onto that the reality of filming with a swarm of fans and paparazzi watching the production speed through the streets. Here, her theater training again paid dividends.\n\n\u201cLive performance is a huge tool for a movie like \u2018Mission,\u2019 because when the curtain goes up, you can\u2019t get a retake, and the audience are going to be there to watch if you fall flat on your face, or your downward inflections bore the audience to tears,\u201d she explains. \u201cYou get feedback by picking up the atmosphere that that you\u2019re helping to create in that auditorium.\u201d\n\nAtwell compares the atmosphere on set to becoming the eye of the storm, with Cruise leading the charge by maintaining his composure at its absolute center and her following suit. \u201cYou\u2019re very calm in the midst of all this noise and stimulation and equipment and changes and locations, and COVID and paparazzi, and journalists and all that stuff,\u201d she says.\n\nThe Rome chase takes place in two vehicles \u2014 a BMW M5 and a Fiat 500, affectionately nicknamed \u201cTrixie,\u201d for the way the tiny automobile whipped through the Italian streets and accidentally bamboozled Cruise.\n\n\u201cShe had sort of a character of herself, which added so much kind of levity to it,\u201d Atwell says of the automobile. \u201cWhen you see Ethan finally being able to turn it on, and then immediately crash the car \u2014 that was real. That hadn\u2019t been intended, and then we used it.\u201d\n\nTom Cruise and Hayley Atwell in \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d Paramount Pictures and Skydance\n\nEmbracing those kinds of spontaneous moments are what made production fun. \u201cThe plot tends to be a metaphor for the making of a \u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 film,\u201d she explains. \u201cMcQ and Tom just go, \u2018OK, well, this is what we\u2019ve got today, so let\u2019s actually find a way to use it for the movie.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd the idea of borrowing from reality works both ways. You see, when you\u2019re so deeply immersed in a character for the length of time a \u201cM:I\u201d movie takes to make, it stands to reason that some of the skills will transfer. In Atwell\u2019s case, it\u2019s the driving, and now, her fianc\u00e9, music producer Ned \u201cWolfgang\u201d Kelly really doesn\u2019t like riding in the car with her.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018Please slow down. It\u2019s quite erratic,\u2019\u201d Atwell says, laughing loudly at a memory of her panicked passenger\u2019s reminder that she\u2019s not in an action film. It\u2019s just that the feeling of your adrenaline rising when you\u2019re behind the wheel can be a little addictive. \u201cIt does sort of rub off on you,\u201d she adds. \u201cI have to rein it in a little bit and go, \u2018I\u2019m just going to the shop.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe training also paid off when Atwell returned to Marvel in 2022\u2019s \u201cDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness\u201d for an action-packed cameo as Captain Carter. \u201cBecause I was so fit at that point, and I\u2019d had such an education about how to move anatomically correctly and making sure that I was safe to do it, I wanted to do all the fighting,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted it to go on much longer than it did.\u201d\n\nWith \u201cMission,\u201d her \u201cscariest\u201d stunt was the train sequence; it took nearly a year to complete because each car had to be built and filmed separately, with Atwell and Cruise shooting and re-shooting portions of the sequence to find the right tone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d see on the call sheet a year later that we\u2019re going to spend the afternoon on that vertical train carriage again and be like, \u2018Oh God, no, I\u2019m so tired from that,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cSo when you see Ethan going, \u2018Do you trust me?\u2019 and Grace just shakes her head \u2014 that\u2019s me going, \u2018Not anymore. I don\u2019t want to do this anymore. It\u2019s really scary.\u2019 They loved it. They were like, \u2018That\u2019s going in.\u2019\u201d\n\nAtwell notes that Cruise, too, gets a case of the nerves when risking his life for stunts. \u201cTom says it\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t get nervous and scared, but that fear is OK for him. He accepts the feeling,\u201d she says. \u201cThey don\u2019t stop him from doing what he wants or needs to do.\u201d\n\nAs for Atwell\u2019s next mission \u2014 that\u2019s territory unknown. \u201cOne thing at a time,\u201d she says with a bright laugh, noting that \u201cDead Reckoning Part Two\u201d is barely two-thirds through its shoot. \u201cJet lag is telling me the thing I want next is a little nap.\u201d\n\nJordan Moreau contributed to this report."

    "text": "In July, Tom Cruise\u2018s latest foray as Ethan Hunt, \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d crashed into movie theaters like a runaway train, taking advantage of the fact it could get premium formats before the unstoppable \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d was unleashed.\n\nMuch of the narrative following \u201cDead Reckoning\u2019s\u201d opening weekend of $54.7 million is that it wasn\u2019t performing up to spec, though one has to remember that it made another $23.8 million before the weekend for a five-day opening of $78.5 million. Although the weekend part was lower than the $61.2 million the previous \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout\u201d opened with in 2018, it was more than every previous \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d movie.\n\nMore from GoldDerby\n\nSEE Grab the popcorn and sound off in our movie forums\n\nThe problem that \u201cDead Reckoning\u201d knew it was going to face was the combination of Greta Gerwig\u2018s \u201cBarbie\u201d and Christopher Nolan\u2018s \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d which were always going to grab all the screens (particular IMAX) just a week after it opened. Almost no one saw the real-life drama \u201cSound of Freedom\u201d coming out of nowhere and making so much money either.\n\n\u201cDead Reckoning\u201d received similar rave reviews as \u201cFallout\u201d and a great \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore, but the summer can be a particularly busy time with many movies demanding screens. A force like \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d is something so rare that not even Cruise could have expected the impact it might have on the latest \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d installment.\n\nSEE 2023 box office hits: Every movie that made more than $100 million\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of the whole franchise, which has now been going on for 27 years:\n\n2023 \u2013 \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d\n\nOpening: $54.7 million; Domestic Gross: $154.1 million\n\n2018 \u2013 \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout\u201d\n\nOpening: $61.2 million; Domestic Gross: $220.2 million\n\n2015 \u2013 \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Rogue Nation\u201d\n\nOpening: $55.5 million; Domestic Gross: $195 million\n\n2011 \u2013 \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol\u201d\n\nOpening: $12.8 million (IMAX only); Domestic Gross: $209.4 million\n\n2006 \u2013 \u201cMission: Impossible III\u201d\n\nOpening: $47.7 million; Domestic Gross: $133.5 million\n\n2000 \u2013 \u201cMission: Impossible 2\u201d\n\nOpening: $57.8 million; Domestic Gross: $215.4 million\n\n1996 \u2013 \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d\n\nOpening: $45.4 million; Domestic Gross: $181 million\n\nIn general, the franchise has had quite a few highs and lows and \u201cDead Reckoning Part One\u201d is still faring better than 2006\u2019s \u201cMission: Impossible III,\u201d a notable misfire for the franchise that may have suffered from Cruise\u2019s private life exploits that was overshadowing his work as an actor during that period. 2011\u2019s \u201cGhost Protocol,\u201d directed by Brad Bird (\u201cThe Incredibles\u201d), took a different approach by being released in over 450 IMAX theaters before expanding wider, and it also was released in December that year, so it was able to get a nice bump from the holidays. (It was also arguably one of the best movies in the franchise until \u201cFallout.\u201d)\n\nSEEBox office preview: \u2018The Last Voyage of the Demeter\u2019 and \u2018Jules\u2019 will battle against \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019\n\nThe problem is that the latest installment isn\u2019t getting any of the theaters it has lost since opening back as \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d hold strong and even gain theaters, so it might not even catch up to the original movie\u2019s $181 million, which doesn\u2019t account for over 25 years of ticket price inflation.\n\nSo what can Paramount do to make sure next year\u2019s \u201cDead Reckoning Part Two\u201d doesn\u2019t follow a similar path as \u201cThe Matrix Revolutions\u201d in 2003 or 2015\u2019s \u201cThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2,\u201d which ended their respective franchises on a low note. \u201cThe Matrix\u201d did try to revive the franchise with 2021\u2019s \u201cThe Matrix Resurrections,\u201d which was anything but, and this November, the prequel \u201cThe Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbird & Snakes\u201d will try to see if that franchise can be revived without any of the original cast.\n\nThe ongoing writers\u2019 and actors\u2019 strikes makes it difficult to know if director Christopher McQuarrie and his team might be able to get \u201cDead Reckoning Part Two\u201d finished sooner, maybe to strike while the iron is still hot or take advantage of the bump in business that movies get over the holidays, a la \u201cGhost Protocol.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP for Gold Derby\u2019s free newsletter with latest predictions\n\nBest of GoldDerby\n\nSign up for Gold Derby's Newsletter.

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.\n\nDidn't Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One just drop in theaters? Yes, it premiered on July 12th, but don't be surprised that the 4K Blu-ray pre-order is already available. The current trend with many of the big new film releases is for the theater and Blu-ray launches to occur simultaneously, presumably so you can get your pre-order in while the joy of watching the film is still fresh in your mind. That said, it seems as though the latest installment will be another big hit for star Tom Cruise, so if you're a fan of the franchise and enjoy his latest death-defying Mission: Impossible outing, details about the Blu-ray release can be found below.\n\nAt the time of writing pre-orders for the DVD, Blu-ray, and standard 4K Blu-ray release of Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One are available here at Walmart and here on Amazon. You can also find the special edition 4K SteelBook release here at Walmart and here on Amazon. A release date and special features haven't been announced this early in the game, but this article will be updated with that information when it becomes available. Additional retailer exclusive Blu-rays are also likely, and they will be added at launch as well.\n\n\"For a series that has struggled with finding its footing while somehow tumbling upwards, Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One could possibly, finally be establishing a long-form narrative,\" critic Patrick Cavanaugh wrote in ComicBook's review. \"While it's billed as a 'Part One,' we're given enough of a resolution to one McGuffin to feel like we were given a complete adventure, as well as knowing full well that there's a lot more to come. After nearly three decades and half a dozen outings, we might finally have real stakes and consequences that will stick with the franchise in perpetuity, possibly implying that anything that happens in this movie finally has an emotional impact on Ethan Hunt (Cruise).\"\n\nWhy Dead Reckoning Is Split in Two Parts\n\nDuring a recent interview with Collider, McQuarrie explained why he opted to split the Dead Reckoning story between two different films.\n\n\"Well, we knew with Fallout. Fallout really grew because of all the character and emotion we were putting into the story, all the things that we had discovered in Rogue Nation that was so unexpected,\" McQuarrie shared. \"I knew I wanted to expand the cast, and I knew I wanted to give each one of those characters more to do, so I knew the movie was going to be bigger and longer than Fallout.\"\n\n\"And at which point I said, 'Why are we fighting this? Why are we going to try to jam this into two hours? Let's just break it in half and make it two movies.' That really was the rationale behind it being a two-part movie. It just it wasn't just that the story was bigger but that we wanted more emotion in the movie,\" he added.\n\nTom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, which is playing in theaters now. It's the beginning of the end for the action-packed franchise, as Cruise reteams with longtime collaborator and filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie for more death-defying and breathtaking stunts. Hunt and allies Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) attempt to track down a new weapon with the power to tear the world apart. Actors Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, and Esai Morales join the cast for the latest installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise, which is set to wrap up with Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part Two."

    "text": "Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One is now playing in theaters, and it marks the third film of the Tom Cruise-led franchise to be helmed by Christopher McQuarrie. It's also the first time that a Mission: Impossible story has been split into two parts. Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part Two is scheduled to be released next June, but that will likely be pushed back because the production is currently on pause due to the WGA and SAG strikes. Recently, McQuarrie spoke with Collider and explained why Dead Reckoning has been split into two parts.\n\n\"Well, we knew with Fallout. Fallout really grew because of all the character and emotion we were putting into the story, all the things that we had discovered in Rogue Nation that was so unexpected,\" McQuarrie explained. \"I knew I wanted to expand the cast, and I knew I wanted to give each one of those characters more to do, so I knew the movie was going to be bigger and longer than Fallout.\"\n\nHe continued, \"And at which point I said, 'Why are we fighting this?

It just it wasn't just that the story was bigger but that we wanted more emotion in the movie.\" He added, \"At that time, the studio were actually very genuinely excited about it ... And, you know, I think we were excited about it too. And then there were times when we were on set, and Tom would look at me, and he'd say, 'This was your idea. Just remember that.'\"\n\nMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One at the Box Office:\n\nMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One has gotten rave reviews, but it hasn't had a very successful run at the box office. The movie is currently up on Rotten Tomatoes with an impressive 96% critics score and a 94% audience score, but it's just not matching the success of other July releases such as Barbie and Oppenheimer. However, the movie isn't exactly a flop, and even reached a box office milestone this week. According to Collider, the seventh Mission: Impossible film has now made $450 million worldwide.\n\nWhile $450 million after three weeks isn't exactly terrible, Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One is the second-lowest-grossing movie in the franchise. The last installment, Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout, remains the highest-grossing movie in the franchise with a total of $791 million worldwide. Mission: Impossible \u2013 Rogue Nation made $688 million worldwide, Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol made $694 million worldwide, and Mission: Impossible II earned $550 million worldwide. The original Mission: Impossible earned $457 million worldwide, which means Dead Reckoning Part One is guaranteed to beat its numbers, however, the first movie was a much bigger success than the current installment when adjusted for inflation. That just leaves Mission: Impossible III, which earned the lowest of the franchise at $399 million worldwide.\n\nWhat Is Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning About?\n\nTom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, which premiered in theaters on July 12th. It's the beginning of the end for the action-packed franchise, as Cruise reteams with longtime collaborator and filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie for more death-defying and breathtaking stunts. Hunt and allies Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) attempt to track down a new weapon with the power to tear the world apart.

    "text": "Rome\u2019s iconic monuments are getting lots of mileage in Hollywood movies this summer.\n\nSince May, the Eternal City has hosted the world premieres of \u201cFast X\u201d and \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One,\u201d two blockbusters that burned rubber and wreaked havoc on its cobblestoned streets.\n\nUniversal held its \u201cFast X\u201d red carpet in the Roman Forum\u2019s Temple of Venus, with the Colosseum as a backdrop, in early May. Weeks later, Paramount descended for the June premiere of \u201cM:I 7,\u201d with Tom Cruise prancing down the same Spanish Steps that serve as the setting for spectacular car chases in both movies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done car chases in \u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 movies before, but nothing like this one,\u201d boasted Cruise on the red carpet. The wild \u201cM:I 7\u201d sequence follows a massive Hummer in hot pursuit of a vintage pint-sized yellow Fiat 500. The latter is driven by Cruise and Hayley Atwell, who, in true \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d fashion, are handcuffed together as the Fiat darts down the ancient staircase.\n\nVin Diesel was similarly amazed by the access granted for \u201cFast X\u201d: \u201cI could not believe that there was a [Dodge] Charger and we were shouting \u2018Action!\u2019 in front of the Colosseum,\u201d he said to Variety. \u201cI never would have dreamed of that happening 20 years ago.\u201d\n\nNeither would the Rome Film Commission, which is taking major strides to make the Italian capital friendlier to film crews as it looks to lure Hollywood shoots.\n\n\u201cThese Rome premieres are the crowning moment of a journey that has made Italy much more attractive as a shooting destination in recent years,\u201d says Cristina Priarone, who heads the Rome commission and also presides over the Italian Film Commissions Assn.\n\nThe game changer, Priarone underlines, is Italy\u2019s generous 40% tax rebates for international film and TV series, which were introduced in 2008 and are among the highest in Europe (topping those of France, the U.K., Germany, Hungary and Romania). In addition, her team has been working closely with local authorities to cut red tape, so the Rome municipal permits office is now \u201ca well-oiled machine.\u201d Meanwhile, Rome\u2019s storied Cinecitt\u00e0 Studios, which has housed productions from \u201cBen-Hur\u201d to \u201cGangs of New York,\u201d is undergoing a significant revamp, further boosting the city\u2019s standing as a moviemaking magnet.\n\nPriarone notes that \u201cM:I 7\u201d began production in Italy in early 2020 at the start of the pandemic: \u201cWe all worked together with regional authorities and the unions to create the conditions for this shoot to take place.\u201d\n\nAt the packed premiere in the Auditorium della Conciliazione, a stone\u2019s throw from the Vatican, Cruise said solemnly onstage, \u201cEveryone knows what was going on in the world when we shot this film here.\u201d\n\n\u201cHad it not been for every person in the entire [Rome] community who worked with us, from the restaurants in the streets, to the police, to everyone on the roads, to the government and medical staff \u2014 all making sure that we\u2019re all safe \u2014 we would not have been able to create what we\u2019re going to see this evening,\u201d he added.\n\nAs for Cruise, the movie star arrived more than 90 minutes late for the gala, having been sidelined by an impromptu meeting with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.\n\nAccording to sources, he wanted to personally thank the Italian premier for making the \u201cM:I 7\u201d event on the Spanish Steps possible. Meloni is believed to have overridden pushback from some local authorities, who were against holding the launch at the 18th-century landmark due to concerns over wear and tear.\n\nThose concerns are indeed well founded.\n\nRoughly a year ago, a 37-year-old Saudi national drove a rented Maserati down the storied staircase, causing damage. He was caught at Milan\u2019s Malpensa airport after being identified by police from images of the vehicle that were caught on surveillance cameras.\n\nSo when in Rome, don\u2019t try what you\u2019ve seen at the movies."

    "text": "Tom Cruise is one of the most popular celebrities in the world and undoubtedly has a one-of-a-kind personality. While he has delivered unforgettable performances and performed death-defying stunts in his recent films, his love life has also been intriguing. Since gaining worldwide fame in the 1980s, Cruise has been romantically linked to several women, and what\u2019s interesting is that most of them are fellow celebrities.\n\nAccording to several reports, his latest girlfriend is his co-star in the upcoming film, \u2018Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One.\u2019 It\u2019s important to know how he became a global icon. Today, he continues to captivate audiences with his on-screen presence.\n\nTom Cruise remains an enigma in Hollywood, leaving us all eager to see what he does next, both personally and professionally. So, let\u2019s take several steps back and get to know about all the gorgeous women he has been romantically linked with over the years. Take a deep breath because the list is quite extraordinary.\n\nMelissa Gilbert\n\nBefore he became Tom Cruise, he was just Tom Mapother. And who was lucky enough to catch his eye during his struggling actor days? None other than the stunning Melissa Gilbert! In one of the most scandalous revelations, Gilbert told Watch What Happens Live that she dated Cruise when she was merely 16 or 17 years of age. Back then, Cruise was a struggling artist trying to make it big, while Gilbert was already a rising star on \u2018Little House on the Prairie\u2019. She even went as far as buying him his first set of dishes. But alas, their fiery romance burned out after a few months.\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating to see how Cruise\u2019s journey began in Hollywood and we don\u2019t how many secrets are locked up in the depths of Tom Cruise\u2019s past.\n\nPatti Scialfa\n\nAfter a short-term relationship with Gilbert, there were rumors of his alliances with Heather Locklear and Rebecca de Mornay. Although these relationships remain unconfirmed, there is one spicy fling that can\u2019t be ignored. Brace yourself, for in 1985, Cruise set his sights on none other than the radiant Patti Scialfa.\n\nAccording to a sizzling People Magazine report, Scialfa had a whirlwind romance with Cruise. From passionate encounters to the fiery embrace of everlasting love with Springsteen, Scialfa\u2019s journey has been one for the books.\n\nCher\n\nTom Cruise and Cher dated in the 80s after meeting at a wedding. They were both famous at the time, with Cher being a pop sensation and Tom Cruise starring in movies like \u2018Top Gun.\u2019 They dated for about a year but eventually broke up. Despite the breakup, they shared a good friendship, and Cher even mentioned Tom Cruise as one of her top lovers in an episode of Watch What Happens Live. This was the last time Tom Cruise dated someone more famous than himself, as his fame grew after the release of \u2018Top Gun.\u2019\n\nMimi Rogers\n\nThe \u2018Mission: Impossible star wed actress Mimi Rogers in 1987, but their union was short-lived. It\u2019s speculated that Rogers introduced Cruise to Scientology, but regardless, their relationship couldn\u2019t stand the test of time. Rogers blamed intimacy issues and their differing career trajectories. Both had successful starts in the film industry, with Rogers earning acclaim for her roles in films like \u2018Gung Ho,\u2019 \u2018Someone to Watch Over Me,\u2019 and \u2018Street Smart,\u2019 yet she found herself overshadowed by Cruise\u2019s stardom. But Rogers didn\u2019t leave empty-handed and received a $4 million settlement in their divorce.\n\nNicole Kidman\n\nTom Cruise wasted no time moving on from his failed marriage to Mimi Rogers and set his eyes on the gorgeous Nicole Kidman. Reports reveal that the sparks flew on the set of \u2018Days of Thunder\u2019 in 1990, and by the time they filmed \u2018Far and Away\u2019 in 1992, they were already husband and wife. This power couple sent shockwaves through Hollywood, but their sizzling on-screen chemistry couldn\u2019t save them from the tumultuous reality of their relationship. It has been widely reported that their collaboration in \u2018Eyes Wide Shut\u2019 (1999) only fueled rumors of their troubled marriage. In the end, the couple\u2019s diverging careers tore them apart and Entertainment Weekly reported that they got divorced in 2001. It\u2019s one of those stories that went down in flames, but they remain united as co-parents to their adopted children, Isabella Jane and Connor Antony.\n\nPenelope Cruz\n\nWe all know how passionate Tom Cruise is and his intense passion knows no bounds. That\u2019s why he didn\u2019t waste any time swiftly moving on from one failed marriage to another while working on the movie, titled \u2018Vanilla Sky\u2019. Without any guesses, his irresistible charm captivated his co-star, the ever-so-gorgeous Penelope Cruz, who played his enchanting love interest on-screen. Despite being so ridiculously famous, they managed to hide their romance from almost everyone. But it seems, Cruz and Cruise were never to stay forever with each other and their love affair reached its inevitable end in 2004. People Magazine went on to report that the duo broke up in January 2004. There were reports that the couple reconciled, as both Cruise and Cruz insisted on remaining in each other\u2019s lives, but sadly, they were just rumors and they never got back with each other. A tale of passion, allure, and the bittersweet nature of Hollywood love.\n\nKatie Holmes\n\nThis one needs very little introduction. Tom Cruise\u2019s relationship with Katie Holmes became a public spectacle when the actor took the stage on \u2018The Oprah Winfrey Show\u2019. He didn\u2019t leave any stone unturned to unleash a flood of unbridled love for the stunning Katie Holmes. Their relationship left viewers captivate and cringing at the same time. The duo exchanged vows in 2005 and embarked on a beautiful journey. A year lear, their married life got even better with the arrival of their precious daughter, Suri. However, just like Tom Cruise\u2019s previous marriages, this also couldn\u2019t stand the test of time. The couple ended their marriage and got divorced in 2012.\n\nIn an interview with InStyle, Holmes didn\u2019t shy away from admitting that the attention of being married to Tom Cruise was \u201coverwhelming\u201d.\n\nHayley Atwell\n\nTom Cruise always tends to find love and even though his love life has slowed down, he can never be out of the game. According to The Sun, Cruise started dating his \u2018Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One co-star Hayley Atwell in 2020. Their relationship blossomed when the movie went into production. Everything looked pretty normal until the day their fairytale love story came to an end in May 2022.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t know the official reason for their split, Tom Cruise and Atwell appear to be very friendly while promoting the movie.\n\nMust Read: BTS RM Felt Like Getting \u201cSlapped Out Of Nowhere\u201d After He Got Accused By Another Rapper Of Selling Out For Better Money: \u201cSomething Everyone Has To Go Through Once In Their Lives\u201d\n\nFollow Us: Facebook | Instagram | Twitter | Youtube | Google News"

    "text": "Wondering if you should choose to accept the latest \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d entry? Maybe you\u2019re sick of all the bombast at the movie theater lately? Well, put it another way: Do you really want to disappoint Tom Cruise?\n\nOn the first day cameras were rolling for \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning, Part One,\u201d Cruise drove a motorcycle off an actual 4,000-foot Norwegian cliff and then parachuted down. He did it for you. The least you can do to repay him is watch his movie, right?\n\nIf you do give in, you\u2019re in for a treat \u2014 a heart-pounding, never dragging, mission accomplished that takes audiences from the frozen Bering Sea to the rooftop of Abu Dhabi International Airport and the narrow alleyways of Venice.\n\nIt\u2019s got plenty of facemasks being ripped off, a car chase through Rome, a shoot-out in the desert, a sword fight on a bridge and an intense, runaway train sequence that may top anything the franchise has ever produced.\n\n\u201cThis is getting exciting,\u201d one character says early on and you\u2019ll heartily agree.\n\nChristopher McQuarrie returns for the third time as director of the spy series \u2014 he also helped write Cruise\u2019s \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d \u2014 and he\u2019s brought back love interest/spy Rebecca Ferguson, comic relief buddies Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames, Vanessa Kirby as The White Widow and Henry Czerny as slimy Eugene Kittridge.\n\nNewcomers include Esai Morales as a very bad baddie and Pom Klementieff as his psychotic aide. Hayley Atwell also makes her impressive debut, playing a master thief and possible romantic partner for Cruise\u2019s Ethan Hunt. (If that makes too many love interests, you\u2019d be right.)\n\nThe bad guy isn\u2019t a guy this time, it\u2019s a haywire form of conscious artificial intelligence that has infiltrated every nation\u2019s computer systems and represents a Hollywood fever dream of this emerging technology. (And maybe a swipe at CGI, too.)\n\nThis AI can foul up every digital device with \u201cthe power to bring the world to its knees\u201d \u2014 or at least to a pre-internet, analog state. It\u2019s \u201can enemy that is everywhere and nowhere.\u201d The filmmakers aren\u2019t too keen in giving too many specifics, leaving it an existential threat and giving it the very non-threatening nickname, The Entity.\n\n\u201cDead Reckoning,\u201d as the \u201cPart One\u201d in the full title suggests, is another action franchise going epic with several-part arcs \u2014 like \u201cSpider-Verse\u201d and \u201cFast & Furious\u201d already this year \u2014 and uses a two-part special key as the plot device that everyone desperately needs, like in \u201cTransformers: Rise of the Beasts.\u201d\n\nThe key here is sought by Cruise, our thief/love interest, a U.S. Special Operations team, Morales\u2019 nasty Gabriel and the arms dealer The White Widow. It soon gets swiped, pickpocketed and seized, jumping from owner to owner like an unwanted Secret Santa office gift.\n\nWhat\u2019s so special about this key? Somehow, the AI needs it and one estimate of its worth is $100 million, which seems pretty cheap, to be honest. \u201cThe fate of the world rests on finding whatever the key unlocks,\u201d we are told. Rhames\u2019 Luther warns his friend: \u201cEthan, you\u2019re playing fourth dimensional chess with an algorithm.\u201d\n\nIf other \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d outings have sometimes felt that Hunt is, well, a little robotic, this time the filmmakers allow some humanity to peek through. Cruise shows some delightful annoyance at having to sit in the passenger seat as his car careens backward through Rome, like an exasperated Drivers\u2019 Ed instructor after a long day. He also shows a tender side in Venice as he cuddles Ferguson in the twilight and they hold hands on a gondola.\n\nSpeaking of that car chase in Rome \u2014 the second time this year that the iconic Spanish Steps have been shattered by a brash, hulking U.S. franchise \u2014 we get the delightful image of Cruise and Atwell handcuffed together scooting along in a tiny, vintage yellow Fiat 500.\n\n\u201cIs anyone NOT chasing us?\u201d she asks.\n\nAll the interested parties come together at one of those big, elegant Eurotrash dance parties with dark lighting, thumping rave music and writhing dancers on platforms that only Hollywood seems to love, a sequence most recently bettered by \u201cJohn Wick: Chapter 4\u201d in Berlin.\n\nThen a movie that started filming pre-pandemic and has a two-and-a-half-hour runtime, culminates with Cruise\u2019s motorcycle leap, a breathless fight sequence on top of a steam train and then a derailment that forces the good guys to climb through railcar after railcar vertically as they dodge debris, bad guys and even, in a sly move, a falling piano.\n\nAre you possibly not going to accept this mission? Tom Cruise basically flew for you. It would be rude to leave him hanging.\n\n\u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning, Part One,\u201d a Paramount Pictures release that\u2019s only in theaters starting Friday, is rated PG-13 for \u201cintense sequences of violence and action, some language and suggestive material.\u201d Running time: 156 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.\n\n___\n\nMPAA Definition of PG-13: Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13.\n\n___\n\nOnline: https://www.missionimpossible.com\n\n___\n\nMark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits"

    "text": "\u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d was finally unveiled at a starry world premiere in Rome on Monday evening, drawing a packed gala screening in the Auditorium della Conciliazione, a stone\u2019s throw from the Vatican.\n\nThe gala screening was delayed by more than 90 minutes as Tom Cruise was holding an apparently impromptu meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni at the Palazzo Chigi, seat of the Italian government.\n\nThe crowd in the auditorium grew increasingly annoyed with having to watch interviews from the red carpet held earlier on the Spanish Steps in what started seeming like an endless loop on the venue\u2019s screen, equipped with a Dolby Atmos sound system for the special occasion.\n\nHowever there was warm applause when Cruise, director Christopher McQuarrie, and a large contingent of the film\u2019s ensemble \u2013 including Hayley Atwell; Rebecca Ferguson; Simon Pegg; Vanessa Kirby; Pom Klementieff, Esai Morales, Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis \u2013 finally arrived.\n\nAnd as soon as Rome appeared on screen the audience started breaking into cheers and shouting out: \u201cBravo Tom!\u201d which happened quite frequently through the screening.\n\nThe event was held in tandem with the Rome Film Festival\u2019s independently run Alice in the City section, dedicated to films for youth audiences. The film\u2019s local distributor is Eagle Pictures, which has a local distribution partnership with Paramount. A substantial amount of the hotly anticipated action film was shot in the Italian capital.\n\n\u201cDead Reckoning Part One\u201d follows the events of \u201cFallout,\u201d where Tom Cruise\u2019s Ethan Hunt and his crew of secret agents saved the world from a nuclear apocalypse amid a series of double-crosses. The 2018 release was the highest-grossing entry in the franchise yet, earning nearly $800 million at the global box office.\n\nThe new film stars Cruise once again, alongside returning franchise players Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Henry Czerny and Vanessa Kirby. Series newcomers include Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, Cary Elwes, Rob Delaney, Indira Varma, Shea Whigham, Mark Gatiss, Esai Morales and Charles Parnell.\n\nAs expected, the film drew strong notices out of its premiere for its impressive stunts. One of the most prominent death-defying acts pushed in the marketing features Cruise actually riding a motorcycle off the edge of a cliff.\n\nSimon Pegg, who returns for \u201cDead Reckoning\u201d after featuring in the previous five installments told Variety that the film\u2019s core is the rapport between Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie, which began in 2011 with \u201cGhost Protocol\u201d on which McQuarrie served as an uncredited writer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become a kind of self-perpetuating evolving relationship where they\u2019ve just egged each other on and challenged each other to move the story forward; to increase the scale; increase the ambition,\u201d Pegg pointed out.\n\nThe seventh \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d entry will be released by Paramount on July 12. See reactions to the film below.\n\nCollider\u2019s Perri Nemiroff said it was \u201canother winner for the franchise\u201d with production values \u201cthrough the roof\u201d and \u201cwell-defined and exhilarating set pieces.\u201d\n\n#MissionImpossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One is another winner for the franchise.

That train scene is mind blowing! pic.twitter.com/raHLqTwqEO \u2014 Joseph Deckelmeier (@joedeckelmeier) June 19, 2023\n\nGizmodo and io9 writer Germain Lussier called it \u201cfantastic,\u201d with a final set piece ranking in the top two to three of the franchise, despite being \u201ca little dense at times.\u201d\n\n#MissionImpossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part 1 is fantastic.\n\n\n\nDynamite, timely story. Excellent new characters. Huge variety of action and a final set piece that ranks top 2-3 all-time for the franchise.\n\n\n\nIt gets a little dense at times but its pace & intensity more than cover that. pic.twitter.com/prm2wa6ZD6 \u2014 Germain Lussier (@GermainLussier) June 19, 2023\n\nIndiewire executive editor Kate Erbland said \u201cit does the best job yet of recent part 1 of 2 features in feeling like its own film while setting up for the next half.\u201d\n\nAfter the insanity of the last few films, #MissionImpossible7 has a tremendous amount to live up to, but one thing I\u2019ll say now in quick reaction format: it does the best job yet of recent \u201cpart 1 of 2!!\u201d features in feeling like its own film while setting up for the next half. \u2014 Kate Erbland (@katerbland) June 19, 2023\n\nFandango\u2019s Erik Davis called it \u201can impeccably made action film that does not stop entertaining.\u201d\n\nI had the absolute best time watching #MissionImpossible \u2013 an impeccably made action film that does not stop entertaining.

    "text": "Riding a motorcycle off a cliff and learning the dangerous sport of speed-flying weren\u2019t the only requirements for acting in \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One.\u201d Tom Cruise also had to fight co-star Esai Morales on the roof of a train moving at 60 miles per hour. The latest \u201cDead Reckoning\u201d behind-the-scenes featurette confirms that Cruise and Morales, the latter of whom plays the film\u2019s villain, shot the fight scene practically, meaning they were literally strapped to the top of a train as it sped through a valley in Norway.\n\n\u201cWhen we started talking about this movie in the terms of a sense of adventure, an action sequence on a train is something we always wanted to do,\u201d writer-director Christopher McQuarrie said. \u201cWe wanted to build upon the previous films and apply that knowledge to something practical and real and bring this train sequence to another level.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was not a surplus of trains available to be wrecked,\u201d he added. \u201cWe had to build the train if we wanted to destroy it. To shoot it practically was extremely challenging. Not just to execute it, but to design all of the different train carts that could function on a real train track.\u201d\n\nThe train\u2019s speed hit the 60 miles per hour mark during filming. That might seem crazy to film on, but for Cruise it\u2019s just another day on the set of a \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d movie.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done fight scenes, but to do them on a moving train is trial by fire,\u201d Morales said. \u201cBut that\u2019s how Tom like to do things.\u201d\n\nA previous featurette revealed Cruise hit speeds of up to 50 miles per hour while speed-flying during one sequence of the movie. Speed-flying, which McQuarrie described as \u201cone of the most dangerous sports in the world,\u201d is similar to paragliding, although the flyer stays closer to the slope as to pick up more speed. Staying closer to the slope increases the chance of collision with land.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very beautiful and delicate sport,\u201d Cruise said of speed-flying. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna do spirals, and we\u2019re landing at an incredibly high speed, over 80 kilometers an hour.\u201d\n\nWhile speed-flying and fighting atop a speeding train present their own risk factors, the most death-defying stunt in \u201cDead Reckoning\u201d is Cruise riding a motorcycle off the edge of a cliff. The stunt was performed on the first day of filming. Cruise preferred it that way, as his survival would determine the rest of filming on the $200 million tentpole.\n\n\u201cWell we know either we will continue with the film or we\u2019re not. Let\u2019s know day one!\u201d Cruise recently told Entertainment Tonight about filming the stunt at the very start of production. \u201cLet us know day one what is going to happen: Do we all continue or is it a major rewrite?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was training and I was ready,\u201d Cruise added. \u201cYou have to be razor sharp when you\u2019re doing something like that. It was very important as we were prepping the film that it was actually the first thing. I don\u2019t want to drop that and go shoot other things and have my mind somewhere else. Everyone was prepped. Let\u2019s just get it done.\u201d\n\n\u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d opens in theaters July 12 from Paramount Pictures."

    "text": "ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 The red carpet unfurled Monday in Abu Dhabi for Hollywood action megastar Tom Cruise, who was on hand for the Middle Eastern premiere of \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One.\u201d\n\nCruise was met by an enthusiastic crowd of fans and movie buffs eager to catch a glimpse of the star at the Emirates Palace Hotel in the capital of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nDressed in a tailored tuxedo and flashing his signature smile, Cruise appeared moved by the exuberant reception, stopping to speak with many attendees. The evening\u2019s buzz was punctuated by the \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d theme, its familiar chords adding a layer of cinematic nostalgia to the night.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a cinephile, I love movies and the history of cinema and how this art form develops,\u201d Cruise told The Associated Press on the red carpet. \u201cI didn\u2019t know whether the audience was going to embrace (the first Mission: Impossible movie), it was the first film I ever produced and I did it because I wanted to challenge myself in many ways as an actor, as a producer, as a storyteller.\u201d\n\n\u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d is the seventh installment of the blockbuster $3.5 billion grossing franchise famed for jam-packed action and ever-daring stunts performed by the 60-year-old Cruise himself.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of fun coming up with these moments,\u201d said Cruise.\n\nThe Mission: Impossible series follows the globe-trotting adventures of Ethan Hunt, a secret agent of the Impossible Missions Force, or IMF, as he undertakes high-risk covert operations. Picture heart-racing action, sophisticated gadgets, and Cruise\u2019s Hunt executing death-defying stunts at every turn.\n\nMatching the topic of the moment, Hunt and his IMF team are tasked with tracking down a potent new artificial intelligence weapon in \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One.\u201d Scenes include base-jumping off a cliff on a motorcycle, hurling a steam train off an exploded bridge, and drifting a yellow Fiat 500 through Rome\u2019s winding streets.\n\nIn a nod to the locale, the film incorporates several action sequences in Abu Dhabi. The desert landscapes of Liwa, known as the Empty Quarter, set the stage for intense horseback chases and firearm confrontations. Cruise runs across the dune-shaped roof of Abu Dhabi International Airport\u2019s new Midfield Terminal in another scene.\n\n\u201cWhen you see us shooting a sequence in Abu Dhabi, it\u2019s about that culture, it\u2019s about that country, and that\u2019s why we keep coming back here,\u201d said Christopher McQuarrie, who is returning for the third time as director of the high-octane spy series.\n\nMcQuarrie joined Cruise on the red carpet along with other Mission: Impossible co-stars, both new and returning. Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff made their franchise debut, while Simon Pegg reprised his role as Benji Dunn, a character known for infusing comedic relief into the franchise\u2019s most tense scenes.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a film which is high-tension you need that to occasionally be injected in order to make it a little bit more enjoyable,\u201d said Pegg.\n\nFollowing pandemic delays, the production companies behind the franchise, Paramount Pictures and Skydance, pushed the film\u2019s release from September of 2022 to July of 2023. A leaked video from the set featured Cruise launching an expletive-laden rant at colleagues after he reportedly spotted two crew members failing to respect social distancing rules. The star expressed his concern about the potential consequences, which included shutting down production and jeopardizing the then-struggling movie industry and the jobs it supports.\n\n\u201cWe just had to write the rulebook on how to make a film during a pandemic,\u201d said Pegg. \u201cMake sure everything was super safe, that was Tom\u2019s biggest challenge in a way was to make us all feel safe and be safe, somehow we muddle through.\u201d\n\nCruise was praised by many for his role in revitalizing Hollywood following the industry\u2019s pandemic-induced stagnation. This recognition came on the heels of his blockbuster film, \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d which not only marked Cruise\u2019s first $100 million debut but also signified the return of blockbuster movies to theaters as the most significant movie debut since the onset of the pandemic.\n\nAbu Dhabi marks the third premiere location for \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One,\u201d with the red carpet previously rolled out at the Spanish Steps in Rome and Leicester Square in London. The movie is set to open in U.S. theaters on July 12."

You know, people sit and they watch and go, 'Are they going snog?' And I think, 'Who the fuck cares?' You know what I mean?\"\n\nShe added that the two are a \"perfect incomplete couple,\" being \"two very similar characters constantly driven to do what is best, getting in the way of each other:\"\n\n\"We\u2019ve all seen that. This is support. They\u2019re two very similar characters constantly driven to do what is best, getting in the way of each other. They are reliably unreliable, and they just make the most perfect incomplete couple. They are juxtaposition.\u201d\n\nIs Ilsa Ethan Hunt's Perfect Match?\n\nAfter fans have wondered for years where Ilsa and Ethan stand in the Mission Impossible franchise, it is interesting to hear from someone directly involved in the will-they-won't-they relationship.\n\nAfter the events of Mission: Impossible - Fallout, it seems that Tom Cruise's franchise figurehead has finally moved one from his wife Julia and is fully ready and open to officially starting a relationship with Ilsa.\n\nOf course, one of the key pillars on which Ethan Hunt is built is the fact that he can never truly love someone as he is too worried they will be brought into the crossfire when secret agent business calls.\n\nBut Ferguson's former MI6 agent is kind of the perfect fit for the situation. She has proven she is more than capable in the field, having now helped Ethan on two world-saving adventures (three if one counts Dead Reckoning Part One).\n\nAnd Ferguson seems to understand that. Yes, it's funny to hear her share her NSFW response when asked about the two, but she gets that Ethan and Ilsa are more than just a flavor of the week James Bond-style couple.\n\nThey are just too busy protecting each other and the world at large to do anything about it. Hopefully, one day, when Ethan and Ilsa's government agent days are over (which may not be coming any time soon), the pair can finally settle down and get the happily ever after ending they are searching for.\n\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is in theaters now."

    "text": "I\u2019ve noticed over the last couple of years that when actors work with Tom Cruise , some of them fall in love with the action star\u2019s sky-related hobbies. For example, he paid for his Top Gun: Maverick co-star\u2019s flight training , and now Glen Powell, who played Hangman, is a pilot. The same kind of effect happened to the actor\u2019s Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One co-star Pom Klementieff , who revealed she fell in love with skydiving after the man behind Ethan Hunt gifted her lessons.\n\nKlementieff, who plays the assassin after Hunt in Mission: Impossible 7 , spoke about all her favorite things with NYT . It\u2019s an eclectic list that included her motorcycle, baking, \u201cnot-safe-for-work socks,\u201d Quentin Tarantino and more. However, the item that stuck out to me was skydiving. She mentioned that she took it up after being given lessons as a wrap gift from Tom Cruise. The thoughtful present, turned into quite the hobby for the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 star, as she said:\n\nI\u2019ve jumped 104 times since October 2021, when Tom Cruise gifted me skydiving lessons as a wrap gift. I love the rush, I love the precision, I love how sharp it makes me. When I jump off a hot-air balloon very early in the morning and the sun is rising and it smells like mist \u2014 it\u2019s magical.\n\nIt sounds like Tom Crusie\u2019s \u201cneed for speed\u201d (and skydiving) has rubbed off on the Dead Reckoning Part One cast member. The Top Gun star is known for being quite the adrenaline junkie both on and off screen (I mean did you see that motorcycle cliff jump in M:I 7 ?), and he seems to love sharing that passion for extreme hobbies with his friends and co-stars.\n\nThis story about Pom Klementieff getting into skydiving because Tom Cruise gifted her lessons reminds me a lot of how Glen Powell got into aviation. The Top Gun: Maverick star got his license in 2020, and he noted in his Instagram post about it that the Maverick actor played a big part in the accomplishment. The Set It Up star said his co-star gifted him flight lessons for Christmas, and he was inspired to pursue aviation because he had watched the actor/producer \u201crocket off into the sunset\u201d while filming the legacy sequel.\n\nMuch like Powell, Klementieff found her passion for the sky after working with Tom Cruise. While she said she was \u201cstressed\u201d working with the M:I star because of the secrets they had to keep about the movie, she also called him \u201cgenerous,\u201d and \u201csuch an inspiration.\u201d\n\nHopefully, we\u2019ll get to see Pom Klementieff and Tom Cruise jump out of planes together. But, for now, we can look forward to them facing off in Dead Reckoning Part One, which is set to premiere on the 2023 movie schedule on July 12."

He recently revealed how much more he has yet to film in the upcoming Tom Cruise-led sequel.\n\nSpeaking to Collider, McQuarrie revealed, \u201cWe've shot [in] all but one of our international locations.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cWe've shot our big action set piece except for the biggest set piece, the central set piece of the film, which is massive and unlike anything we've done, and, I think, unlike anything you've ever seen.\u201d\n\nIn conclusion, \u201cAll the interstitial stuff is shot. There are characters in the movie you don't even know about yet. And I have one. \u2014 how would I call it? It's a sidebar action sequence involving the team, which we haven't shot yet, and that's first up as soon as we get back. It's involving elements that I've never worked with before. It's a big challenge, and it's a tight schedule.\u201d\n\nSo when does he expect to get back to work on the eighth Mission: Impossible? \u201cThe plan to be wrapped for all principal photography is early next year,\u201d he said.\n\nMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part Two will be released on June 28, 2024, so they have quite a bit of time to finish filming and head into post-production. The latest film already pushed the boundaries of what can be done in film, it's hard to imagine what Tom Cruise and Co. have in store next.\n\nMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One will be released on July 12. Dead Reckoning Part Two will be released on June 28, 2024"

    "text": "Just a year after Tom Cruise set the box office ablaze with \u2018Top Gun: Maverick\u2019, Hollywood\u2019s most bankable star is looking to achieve a new record with the seventh installment in the Mission Impossible series, \u2018Mission Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\u2019. The movie will release on July 12, across 2,000 theatres in India.\n\nMission Impossible 7\u2019s impressive advance booking numbers\n\nThe movie has created a huge buzz ahead of its release, with people booking well over 62,000 tickets for the coming weekend. The Tom Cruise film has already earned Rs 2.76 crore in the Indian box office from advance bookings. Over 62,588 tickets for the weekend have already been sold across just PVR, Inox, and Cinepolis theatres, reported Box Office World. Reports claimed the advance bookings to be over 68,000 for the opening day alone and a staggering total of over 1.5 lakh tickets across the five-day opening weekend.\n\nMission Impossible set for $1 billion run?\n\nWith positive early reviews, good responses to trailers, the general excitement about the movie, there is significant hype behind the \u2018Mission Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\u2019 across social media. Add to the fact that Cruise\u2019s last entry, \u2018Maverick\u2019 had earned a cool $1.49 billion worldwide and the last Mission Impossible entry, \u2018Fallout\u2019 had earned $791.1 million worldwide, expectations for his latest silver screen showing are high.\n\nThe year 2023 has been a mostly disappointing year for international movies. The highest-grossing movie of the year, and the only one to cross the $1 billion mark, was \u2018The Super Mario Bros. Movie\u2019. Several films from big franchises like \u2018Shazam! Fury of the Gods\u2019, \u2018Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\u2019, \u2018The Flash\u2019 have essentially bombed. While \u2018Fast X\u2019 and \u2018Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\u2019 were solid hits, they failed to cross over the $1 billion mark.\n\nTom Cruise vs Mario\n\nMission Impossible 7\u2019s biggest opponent so far on the charts is \u2018The Super Mario Bros. Movie\u2019. The movie managed to rake in over $770 million at the international box office, which MI 7 will hope to beat with Cruise\u2019s international appeal as a Hollywood superstar. \u2018Dead Reckoning\u2019 has the potential to become the biggest movie of 2023, but will face stiff competition from Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u2018Barbie\u2019 and Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019, which will be fighting it out on July 21.\n\nAbout Mission Impossible 7\n\nHelmed by Christopher McQuarrie, the latest Mission Impossible film sees Ethan Hunt and his newest mission, should he choose to accept it, revolve around the threat only known as \"The Entity\". Hunt, played by Cruise, along with his fellow IMF agents are in a deadly race to track down a terrifying new weapon that threatens all of humanity. Apart from Cruise, the movie also stars Tom Cruise, Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, and Rebecca Ferguson in familiar roles.\n\nSocial media wowed by Cruise\u2019s Mission Impossible\n\nAhead of the film's launch, Mission Impossible 7 is witnessing a huge buzz on social media, as fans are eagerly waiting to see Cruise's death-defying stunts. Starting from the time when Tom Cruise shared the first behind-the-scenes video of his jump from a cliff to the exhilarating train sequence, the film has been in the news.\n\n\u2018Mission Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\u2019 is set to be the penultimate installment with Cruise reprising his role as Ethan Hunt, with \u2018Dead Reckoning: Part 2\u2019 in June 2024."

    "text": "Vin Diesel and Jason Momoa\u2019s Fast X emerged as the first 100 crore nett earner at the Indian box office in 2023 and now, everyone awaits the release of Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, aka Mission: Impossible 7. With Tom Cruise leading the film, expectations are really high and it could even become the biggest hit in the post-pandemic era. Keep reading to know more!\n\nSurprisingly, Cruise has never delivered a 100 crore movie at the Indian box office but with MI 7 enjoying huge pre-release buzz, the actor is expected to make his much-awaited entry into the coveted club. For the unversed, his last release \u2018Top Gun: Maverick\u2018 did a business of 35 crores in India and was a successful affair.\n\nIn the post-Covid era, Tom Holland\u2019s Spider-Man: No Way Home is the biggest Hit in India as its profit stands at 182.66%. Its theatrical valuation is 75 crores here and in return, it made 212 crores in the lifetime run. In the second position is Fast X with 162.5% returns. Avatar: The Way Of Water (157.93%) and Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness (153.88%) are also on the list.\n\nExact valuation of Tom Cruise\u2019s Mission: Impossible 7 is yet to be known, but crossing Spider-Man: No Way Home\u2018s 182.66% returns won\u2019t be a huge task if the film hits the right chord with the audience. As of now, considering all the craze and the franchise\u2019s popularity in India, the film is expected to open around 20 crores or even more.\n\nIt\u2019ll be interesting to see if Tom Cruise gets the most-profitable Hollywood film in the post-pandemic era under his kitty with Mission: Impossible 7!\n\nStay tuned to Koimoi for more box office stories & updates!\n\nNote: Box office numbers are based on estimates and various sources.

Yet again, the production value is THROUGH THE ROOF with some of the most well-defined and exhilarating set pieces photographed in ways that truly make you feel like you\u2019re in the middle of the action. The emphasis on capturing things in camera makes a HUGE difference, and you can feel it.\u201d\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nCritic Germain Lussier also wrote: \u201cDead Reckoning Part 1 is fantastic. Dynamite, timely story. Excellent new characters. Huge variety of action and a final set piece that ranks top 2-3 all-time for the franchise. It gets a little dense at times but its pace & intensity more than cover that.\u201d\n\nIndieWire\u2019s Kate Erbland praised the movie for \u201cfeeling like its own film while setting up for the second half\u2026 after the insanity of the last few films, #MissionImpossible7 has a tremendous amount to live up to, but one thing I\u2019ll say now in quick reaction format: it does the best job yet of recent \u2018part 1 of 2!!\u2019 features.\u201d\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nSeveral critics have noted the movie\u2019s themes and villain; more specifically, how it examines artificial intelligence. \u201cMISSION: IMPOSSIBLE \u2013 DEAD RECKONING PART ONE works as Christopher McQuarrie\u2019s ambitious examination of/meditation on AI and the dangerous path we might be on. (He doesn\u2019t like it),\u201d Uproxx\u2019s Mike Ryan wrote, adding: \u201cWith the inherent nature of being \u2018part one\u2019 (said that a lot lately), not as satisfying as FALLOUT.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest updates on Esports, Gaming and more.

And bless his crazy ass, b/c this is a behemoth-sized spectacle, one go-for-broke set-piece after the next, close to FALLOUT excellence. Henry Czerny fans will go nuts.\u201d\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nIn a particularly negative reaction, The Wrap\u2019s Scott Mendelson wrote: \u201c#MissionImpossible7 was a big letdown. Wonky dialogue, oddly broad acting, and narrative contrivances/shortcuts that (being generous) seemed like COVID-related issues. Felt \u2018off\u2019 in a way akin to \u2018Saw 3-D\u2019 after \u2018Saw VI\u2019. For the sake of the industry, I hope I\u2019m in the minority.\u201d\n\nAre there any Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part 1 reviews?\n\nNo, there aren\u2019t any full reviews for Mission: Impossible 7 right now.\n\nWhile the social embargo has already lifted, it\u2019s unclear when critics will be permitted to publish reviews online and in print, but we\u2019ll update this space as soon as they\u2019re live.\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nArticle continues after ad\n\nIs there a Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part 1 Rotten Tomatoes score?\n\nMission: Impossible 7 doesn\u2019t have a Rotten Tomatoes score right now.\n\nWe\u2019ll update this space as soon as its score is revealed.\n\nMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part 1 will hit cinemas on July 14, 2023.

On Saturday, he lived up to his reputation as a daredevil by boarding his private helicopter at Battersea Heliport.\n\nAs he made his way to his helicopter, the 60-year-old Hollywood actor sported a laid-back ensemble consisting of a baby blue polo t-shirt and denim. He completed the outfit with black boots, black sunglasses, and a stylish watch.\n\nThe Top Gun star seemed to be in a cheerful mood as he was photographed just before boarding his private helicopter to Biggin Hill.\n\nHe has been occupied with preparations for the highly anticipated seventh installment of the Mission Impossible franchise.\n\nThe Magnolia star, along with Hayley Atwell, shone on the red carpet on Thursday for the premiere of Mission: Impossible 7 Dead Reckoning Part One in London.\n\nDespite facing significant delays because of the COVID-19 pandemic and an unprecedented budget of $290 million, the 60-year-old Hollywood actor and his 41-year-old co-star appeared thrilled to be commemorating the film's release.\n\nDuring the red carpet event, the duo was accompanied by Rebecca Ferguson, who returned to her role as Ilsa Faust.\n\nEarlier this week, the world premiere in Rome garnered enthusiastic reviews from early critics, who praised it as \"dynamite\" and predicted it to be a summer blockbuster."

    "text": "Christopher McQuarrie\u2019s Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One expands on the themes of technological anxiety that animated last year\u2019s Tom Cruise vehicle, Top Gun: Maverick, which McQuarrie co-wrote and began with the threat of human pilots being phased out in favor of drones and artificial intelligence. Here, the generic roster of villains that dot the Mission: Impossible franchise reaches its logical endpoint, with the interchangeable global terrorists replaced with an experimental A.I. dubbed \u201cThe Entity\u201d that\u2019s become sentient and gone rogue, prompting various national agencies and independent parties to embark on a hunt for the program\u2019s site of operation to either destroy it or weaponize it for their own ends.\n\nIn both movies, the thematic subtext of A.I.\u2019s looming threat is obvious, as much a warning against dehumanized warfare as a commentary on the increasingly soulless, anti-human nature of blockbuster filmmaking that Cruise\u2019s old-school allegiance to practical stunts and star power seeks to defy. Admittedly, there\u2019s a sense of having one\u2019s cake and eating it to this idea, not only because both films are pieces of franchise IP, but because Dead Reckoning Part One in particular throws up a completely boilerplate Mission: Impossible plot of Ethan Hunt (Cruise) attempting to thwart global disaster while also protecting those closest to him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery installment of this franchise uses these narrative touchstones as launching pads for the main draw of spellbinding action, but Dead Reckoning Part One treats its formulaic plot as if it were newly concocted. Much is made of how Ethan\u2019s comrades are targeted in order to get to him, but this has been a common feature of all of the movies in this franchise, and the film isn\u2019t done any favors by his long-standing comrades feeling so bland and dispensable.\n\nIn fact, the supporting player with the most gravitas and who\u2019s given the most attention isn\u2019t even a returning character like Simon Pegg\u2019s Benji Dunn and Ving Rhames\u2019s Luther Stickell but newcomer Grace (Hayley Atwell), a thief whose attempts to steal the key to The Entity place her in constant conflict with Ethan\u2019s team as they seek the same device. It\u2019s a bizarre pivot, as it robs some heavy moments between Ethan\u2019s teammates of their intended gravity.\n\nStill, Atwell makes a phenomenal addition to the series and is the most consistently engaging actor here. The film doesn\u2019t attempt to set up Grace as another doomed romantic partner for Ethan, instead letting the actress channel some of that adventure-serial sass and self-reliance that she brought to her Peggy Carter in the first Captain America. McQuarrie has gradually amped up the comedy in this franchise over the course of his involvement, and Atwell proves to be the most reliable mouthpiece for his blend of Wilderesque banter and screwball physicality.\n\nCompared to Grace\u2019s complexity, it\u2019s hard to overlook how poorly defined the film\u2019s antagonists are. When it comes to The Entity, that lack of definition is initially presented as a feature and not a bug, with its faceless, incorporeal presence contributing to its omnipresent menace. But there are too few demonstrations of the A.I.\u2019s actual power, and in the place of showing The Entity in action there\u2019s endless exposition from other characters about its potential to do harm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Entity\u2019s chief human asset, a mysterious figure named Gabriel (Esai Morales), is even less defined, though that\u2019s partially by design. With the final Mission: Impossible installment now split into two films, basic details about Gabriel\u2019s background are withheld from us, effectively reducing the man to little more than a reciter of generically menacing monologues. An ingenious moment, in which the possibility of a secret mastermind manipulating Ethan and the villains alike is teased, harkens back to the post-Cold War commentary of Brian De Palma\u2019s Mission: Impossible, only for the film to immediately walk back that idea.\n\nHappily, the film finds its footing when it comes to its action, even blatantly echoing signature moments from the franchise. The first, a frantic car chase through Rome, recalls the Paris segment from McQuarrie\u2019s Fallout (and inadvertently features a moment of careening down the city\u2019s Spanish Steps that greatly resembles a moment in this year\u2019s Fast X). Meanwhile, a climactic brawl on a train can\u2019t help but bring to mind the conclusion of the first film in the franchise. But Dead Reckoning Part One approaches these sequences from fresh angles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the car chase, McQuarrie makes excellent use of sudden intrusions of civilian cars into the edges of the frame to heighten the chaos of Ethan barreling down ancient streets as police and special ops assassins pursue him. The pandemonium of a random driver accidentally colliding with Ethan and sending his car spiraling out of control brings some of the real world into the cartoonish antics of Mission: Impossible and forces the spy to think quickly on his feet.\n\nThose cartoonish aspects are riotously reinforced, though, in a climactic train sequence that\u2019s as much a straightforward action showstopper as it is a tribute to Buster Keaton\u2019s The General, with Ethan and others frantically attempting to reckon with a runaway locomotive careens toward a ravine. The absurd images of characters clamoring out of a series of rail cars slipping into oblivion cap off a recurring element of visual comedy that runs through the film. Ethan repeatedly and amusingly stays one step ahead of his pursuers, often sprinting away in the background as agents in the foreground look around for him in frustration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe action consistently snaps the film into focus, but it also further illustrates how badly the decision to split this narrative into two parts throws off the delicate rhythm that\u2019s made Mission: Impossible arguably the most consistently entertaining American action franchise of all time. When Dead Reckoning Part One settles into its set pieces or moments of caper comedy, it soars. As such, it inevitably makes one hope that the overabundance of setup will translate to a second part that sends Ethan into the sunset on a more streamlined and refined note.\n\nScore: Cast: Tom Cruise, Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, Henry Czerny Director: Christopher McQuarrie Screenwriter: Christopher McQuarrie, Erik Jendresen Distributor: Paramount Pictures Running Time: 163 min Rating: PG-13 Year: 2023 Buy: Video Tom Cruise, Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, Henry CzernyChristopher McQuarrieChristopher McQuarrie, Erik JendresenParamount Pictures163 minPG-132023"

    "text": "There's not really a plot in \"Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One\" but there sure are a lot of plot-lets.\n\nThere's a free-spirited pickpocket (Hayley Atwell) who tangles with Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt. There are agents tasked with taking down Hunt, who has been classified as a rogue. And the \"dead reckoning\" part of that unwieldy title refers to the steering of a nuclear submarine that is glimpsed in the opening sequence and then mostly forgotten about. What we know about the sub is that it contains half of a key to an artificial intelligence device whose owner will \u2014 all together now \u2014 control the world.\n\nLike last month's \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,\" \"Reckoning\" tries to revitalize a several decades-old franchise with both the pursuit of a world-controlling key that comes in two pieces and the pairing of the veteran hero with a much younger raven-haired Englishwoman (Atwell).\n\nThis seventh \"Mission\" incorporates bits from previous entries in the series, which underscores how much it has changed from its beginnings, Brian De Palma's elegant, Hitchcock-influenced 1996 spy thriller. John Woo's sequel began the process of transforming \"Mission\" movies into loud, James Bond-esque, world-traveling adventures that are packed with stunts \u2014 and no \"Mission\" has been more stunt-packed than \"Dead Reckoning.\"\n\nThere's the motorcycle-off-a-cliff sequence that has been analyzed since it debuted online last year but also a race to defuse a bomb hidden in the luggage network of an airport, a battle atop a speeding train (another element \"Destiny\" shares), a pursuit through the beautifully lit alleys of Venice and a thrilling car chase in the streets of Rome that feels fresh because it features something old (as in \"The 39 Steps,\" our hero is chained to a woman who dislikes him) and something witty and quite new: The car they're in doesn't work very well.\n\nWriter/director Christopher McQuarrie, who also made the last \"Mission,\" stages these sequences with skill and energy. Things are chaotic, obviously \u2014 something is almost always on the verge of blowing up \u2014 but McQuarrie makes sure we have enough spatial information to understand where the bad guys and good guys are in relation to each other.\n\n\"Mission\" has plenty of good guys \u2014 in addition to Cruise and (possibly) Atwell, colleagues Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson and Simon Pegg are back. Although they're initially anti-Hunt, there also are a couple of CIA types played by Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis, the latter of whom is positioned to be a future \"Mission\" lead if Cruise decides to hang up his masks.\n\nBad guys, though? Not so much. Esai Morales and Vanessa Kirby both underplay their villains to such an extent that they practically vanish, a consistent problem in \"Mission\" movies. Movie fans can easily name half a dozen 007 villains but, give or take Philip Seymour Hoffman in the third one, can you come up with a single \"Mission\" antagonist?\n\nPerhaps a charismatic baddie will emerge in \"Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part Two,\" scheduled for next June. I'm guessing there will be more of a plot in that one, too, since the final scenes of \"Part One\" finally get us back to that submarine and since several promising actors are being added for that eighth \"Mission,\" including Hannah Waddingham, Janet McTeer and Nick Offerman.\n\nOne advantage of \"Part One\" de-emphasizing plot is that there's not a lot for it to wrap up. It ends on a cliffhanger, to be sure. But unlike divided-in-two movies such as \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\" \"Part One\" actually feels like a complete movie, one that gives us plenty of satisfying sequences but also leaves us wanting more.\n\n'Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One'\n\n*** out of 4 stars\n\nRated: PG-13 for violence and language.\n\nWhere: In theaters."

    "text": "Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One is fast approaching and during a recent interview with director Christopher McQuarrie, he offered an explanation as to why the film was split into two parts, and it\u2019s not just because it was a bigger story. During a recent interview with Collider, McQuarrie said:\n\n\"Well, we knew with Fallout. Fallout really grew because of all the character and emotion we were putting into the story, all the things that we had discovered in Rogue Nation that was so unexpected. I knew I wanted to expand the cast, and I knew I wanted to give each one of those characters more to do, so I knew the movie was going to be bigger and longer than Fallout.\"\n\nThen it just got to the point where the creative team questioned why they were trying to fit everything they wanted to do into one movie. They wanted to build an epic story and make sure there was enough time to play with the emotion of it all. McQuarrie went on to say:\n\n\"And at which point I said, 'Why are we fighting this? Why are we going to try to jam this into two hours? Let's just break it in half and make it two movies.' That really was the rationale behind it being a two-part movie. It just it wasn't just that the story was bigger but that we wanted more emotion in the movie.\u201d\n\nThe filmmaker then went on to talk about the challenges of developing a two-part action thriller epic, saying:\n\n\"Yeah, it's massive, and it was complicated by the fact that certain things in Part Two required stopping Part One to shoot them, whether it was because of weather or actor availability. And so, with all the other challenges that were confronting this movie while we were making it, there was the challenge of stopping in the middle, not even knowing what the full movie was, and trying to predict what it was in the second film. It's a testament to how great this team is and how patient this cast is. It's really something.\u201d\n\nWell, I\u2019m really excited to see how the story these next two films tell will play out! Everything I\u2019ve seen from Dead Reckoning Part One has been awesome, and the reviews that have been coming in are extremely positive. So, it seems like fans are in for another awesome Mission: Impossible adventure!\n\nIn Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, \u201cEthan Hunt and his IMF team embark on their most dangerous mission yet: To track down a terrifying new weapon that threatens all of humanity before it falls into the wrong hands. With control of the future and the fate of the world at stake, and dark forces from Ethan's past closing in, a deadly race around the globe begins. Confronted by a mysterious, all-powerful enemy, Ethan is forced to consider that nothing can matter more than his mission \u2013 not even the lives of those he cares about most.\u201d\n\nThe movie stars Tom Cruise, Hayley Atwell, Rebecca Ferguson, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Vanessa Kirby, and Henry Czerny along with newcomers Shea Whigham (Joker), Pom Klementieff (Guardians of the Galaxy 2, Avengers: Infinity War) Esai Morales (La Bamba, Titans), Charles Parnell, Indira Varma (Game of Thrones), Mark Gatiss, and Cary Elwes (Saw). Nick Offerman (Parks and Recreation), Janet McTeer (Tumbleweeds, Albert Nobbs), Hannah Waddingham (Ted Lasso), and Holt McCallany (Mindhunter, Nightmare Alley).\n\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One hits theaters on July 12th and Part Two is currently dated July 28th, 2024."

    "text": "The film hits cinemas on July 8, but pre-production started in 2019 before experiencing significant delays due to the pandemic. Shot with a budget of $290 million, it is set to be one of the year\u2019s biggest box office releases, a film designed to drag audiences back into cinemas. Completing his own stunt work has become a part of the Cruise mythology. According to McQuarrie, that has been the aim of his leading man all along. \u201cThese are the kinds of movies we need right now, we\u2019re looking at an industry hanging on by its fingernails, and Tom is doing everything he can to bring people back to the theatre,\u201d he says. That\u2019s no understatement. From driving motorbikes off cliffs to base jumping onto a moving train, Dead Reckoning is a testament to Cruise\u2019s willingness to try anything once. \u201cWe actually did the cliff thing six times,\u201d laughs McQuarrie.\n\nCompleting his own stunt work has become a part of the Cruise mythology; he famously broke his right ankle during a roof-jumping stunt on Mission: Impossible 6. For a director, it sounds like a working nightmare, a hugely famous lead determined to do everything himself. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful, but I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way, and neither would Tom; it\u2019s all very considered,\u201d says McQuarrie. \u201cThe other day, someone made a comment about him being fearless, and he said, \u2018It\u2019s not that I am not scared; it\u2019s that I don\u2019t mind being scared,\u2019 and that\u2019s the difference. People assume Tom Cruise is a daredevil, but he\u2019s just dedicated to confronting the fear.\u2019\u201d At 61, Cruise may soon need to confront a different fear; getting older. He remains the world\u2019s most bankable and daring action star, with contemporaries like Stallone and Schwarzenegger no longer vying for box office dollars.\n\nBut with Dead Reckoning set to be a two-part epic, might Cruise call it a day after this? \u201cEven if I knew the answer to that question, I couldn\u2019t be sure because I\u2019ve learned that with Mission: Impossible and with Tom, you just don\u2019t know what will happen when we wrap,\u201d says McQuarrie. Should the impossible become possible and age catches up with Cruise, the franchise could have ready-made replacements in British actress Atwell and French Avengers star Klementieff. Simon Pegg, Hayley Atwell, Tom Cruise and Pom Klementieff. Atwell plays Grace, a sleight-of-hand expert who ends up working alongside Ethan Hunt, while Klementieff is Paris, a French assassin tasked with hunting the pair. Both hold their own in Dead Reckoning, undergoing five months of intense training before filming commenced.\n\n\u201cI certainly learned a lot, but this series is so synonymous with Tom; if there were a spin-off, it wouldn\u2019t be the classic Mission: Impossible world,\u201d says Atwell. Loading \u201cThere would have to be some understanding that it is new territory, but it could work; I don\u2019t know if I am prepared to jump off a cliff. Klementieff agrees, adding: \u201cThe way the females are developed makes them powerful and have their agency; they never depend on the man, they aren\u2019t girlfriends, and much of that comes down to what Tom wants.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what the future holds, but I will always be ready to play Paris.\u201d\n\nHow Dead Reckoning Part One will perform remains to be seen, but the bar has been set high. The previous MI film, Fallout, had a total worldwide gross of US$791 million against a production budget of $178 million, becoming the franchise\u2019s highest-grossing film so far. Dead Reckoning opens two weeks before both Barbie and Oppenheimer, two of the other most hyped films of the year. But if he\u2019s feeling the pressure, McQuarrie does an excellent job of hiding it. Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie on the set of the new Mission: Impossible film. \u201cUltimately, Barbie and Oppenheimer are also movies made by people who want to make movies for the audience, not an audience, and that is the smart thing; that\u2019s what we\u2019re all trying to do; more power to them.\u201d Hard to argue with that."

    "text": "Tom Cruise and the Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One crew are detailing what went into filming the epic speed-flying scene for the upcoming film.\n\nThe actor, known for going above and beyond with his stunts, learned how to do what director Christopher McQuarrie called \u201cone of the most dangerous sports in the world\u201d for the latest installment in the action franchise.\n\nIn a recent video giving a behind-the-scenes look at the movie, the filmmaker explained that since \u201cthere are no limits\u201d with Cruise, \u201cwe become a little bit more adventurous every time.\u201d And this time, the actor decided to do a \u201csport very few people on this planet do.\u201d\n\nMcQuarrie went on to explain that \u201cwhile it may look similar, speed-flying is not skydiving. Skydiving is fairly predictable. Speed-flying is incredibly unpredictable.\u201d\n\nThe air sport, similar to paragliding, combines elements of parachute swooping to allow people to fly at high speeds down mountainsides while maintaining close to the slope.\n\nIn the footage, Cruise said of the stunt, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna do spirals, and we\u2019re landing at an incredibly high speed, over 80 kilometers an hour.\u201d\n\nMcQuarrie added that although it \u201clooks quite beautiful\u201d when \u201cflying very close to rocks,\u201d the crew was in \u201cabsolute terror\u201d behind the cameras. Especially since they had to overcome several technical challenges, including coming up with the stunt and finding the most dynastic way to shoot it.\n\nThe director called the whole experience a \u201cone-of-a-kind adventure.\u201d\n\nTaking on death-defying stunts is nothing new to Cruise. Throughout his decades-long career, the actor has continued to look for ways to push the limits for projects, from scaling a skyscraper to dangling on the outside of a plane. In his upcoming film, he also drove a motorcycle off a cliff and parachuted to safety on the first day of filming.\n\nMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One is set to hit theaters on July 12."

It\u2019s this man, Mr. Tom Cruise. When this whole process started four years ago, we were entering a period where it looked like this event was headed for extinction. It was a very real possibility that this medium that we loved so much was on its way out. One person said, \u2018No, we\u2019re gonna keep it going\u2019. And that\u2019s this man right here,\u201d McQuarrie said.\n\nThe Sydney premiere fell on Cruise\u2019s 61st birthday, however both McQuarrie and the star himself insisted there was nowhere he\u2019d rather be.\n\n\u201cI think he deserves a big hand,\u201d McQuarrie said of Cruise. \u201cHe loves this medium and loves entertaining a big audience on the big screen. And I want you to remember that when he\u2019s throwing himself off a cliff later, he did it for you. He didn\u2019t do it for me. He did it for you.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Cruise said it was amazing to be back making big blockbuster films for audiences to enjoy.\n\n\u201cWhen to see how much an audience enjoys it [it\u2019s amazing],\u201d he said. \u201cI make my movies for you all, all my movies I make, and I\u2019m dreaming and I\u2019m thinking about this experience and to see how much you all enjoy it, that such a gift to me.\u201d\n\nAs for whether there will be any other \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d films in the franchise following \u201cDead Reckoning \u2013 Part Two\u201d, Cruise simply said \u201ctalk to me next year\u201d. He did, however, concede there were more stunts and adventures he wanted to partake in.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always another mountain, there\u2019s always something else, but let\u2019s enjoy this evening first,\u201d he said."

    "text": "A love story between \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d newcomer Hayley Atwell and Tom Cruise is pure fiction.\n\nThe British actress, who co-stars with Cruise in the upcoming action thriller \u201cMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One,\u201d opened up about past speculation that she dated Cruise in an interview with The Independent published Saturday.\n\nAtwell, who is engaged to music producer Ned Wolfgang Kelly, said she views Cruise and \u201cDead Reckoning\u201d director Christopher McQuarrie as \"sort of two uncles.\"\n\n\"I would be like, \u2018Ooh, there\u2019s some weird rumors, and it feels base. It feels a little dirty,\" Atwell told the British outlet. \"It feels grubby. It\u2019s not what I\u2019m about. Why are things being assumed or projected onto me about my relationship with my work colleague and boss?\"\n\nAtwell added that she found the rumors \"upsetting\" because of the scrutiny it brought to her private life.\n\n\"It\u2019s involving people in my actual life, my personal life, who have to be on the receiving end of that,\" Atwell said. \"It becomes invasive.\"\n\n'Impeccably made':'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One' lauded for action-packed drama\n\nMarking the seventh installment in the iconic \"M:I\" franchise, \"Dead Reckoning Part One\" follows Cruise\u2019s secret agent Ethan Hunt as he faces off against \"The Entity,\" an evolving form of artificial intelligence that threatens global security. Atwell plays enigmatic thief Grace in the film. The pair becomes an effective duo, navigating a wild car chase through Rome in a tiny Fiat and a hellacious train trip on the Orient Express.\n\n\"Dead Reckoning\" has earned rave reviews from critics for its stunning action sequences and compelling performances. Erik Davis of Fandango called the film an \"impeccably made action film that does not stop entertaining.\"\n\n\"Each action sequence is long, crazy and intense,\" Davis wrote on Twitter. \"The story is big and sprawling, but I like how it both felt complete and left you dying for what comes next.\"\n\nPerri Nemiroff of Collider said the film is \"another winner for the franchise,\" including the addition of Atwell\u2019s character. \"She can do it all. Action, comedy, a capable hero in many respects while trying to get her sea legs in others,\" Nemiroff tweeted.\n\nUSA TODAY film critic Brian Truitt gave the film three out of four stars, writing that while \"Dead Reckoning\" is chock-full of gloriously bonkers stunt sequences, its technological villain introduces some narrative obstacles.\n\n\"If you choose to accept this 'Mission' \u2013 and what action-movie fan or Cruise nerd wouldn\u2019t, really \u2013 it\u2019s the first half of a man vs. machine epic that doesn\u2019t skimp in the thrills department,\" Truitt wrote. \"Just don\u2019t think too hard about it, though you\u2019ll probably still give serious side-eye to your laptop.\"\n\n'Mission: Impossible 7' review:Tom Cruise fights AI in fun, far-fetched 'Dead Reckoning'\n\nContributing: Brian Truitt, USA TODAY"

    "text": "Contrary to media reports, \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part Two\u201d is not being delayed by the ongoing writers\u2019 strike and shooting is set to resume later this summer after Tom Cruise and the film\u2019s cast complete their promotional work for \u201cPart One,\u201d according to insiders with knowledge of the production.\n\nLast week, Empire Magazine published an interview with \u201cDead Reckoning\u201d director Christopher McQuarrie, where he acknowledged the delays and hurdles that his team\u2019s work on the two \u201cM:I\u201d films have had to face.\n\n\u201cBehind each tsunami is another tsunami,\u201d McQuarrie said. \u201cIt\u2019s unrelenting. We live in a state of 24-hour tsunami awareness. That\u2019s just what we do.\u201d\n\nWhile McQuarrie was not quoted as referring to specific delays such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the article says that \u201cobstacles for this double production have already included a pandemic and now encompass an ongoing writer\u2019s strike.\u201d\n\nThis led other film media outlets like Slash Film to report that the writers\u2019 strike has extended the current pause on shooting, which studio insiders say is inaccurate as McQuarrie and Cruise are taking a scheduled break from production to do interviews for \u201cDead Reckoning: Part One\u201d and to attend that film\u2019s premiere in Rome next weekend.\n\nThe WGA strike, which is currently in its seventh week, has led to shutdowns on countless film and TV productions while on-location permits for shooting in the Los Angeles area have dwindled to zero over the past month. But some high-profile productions have pushed on, including Marvel Studios\u2019 \u201cDeadpool 3,\u201d which is still shooting in Canada ahead of a rescheduled release date in May 2024.\n\nIt is still possible, however, that the productions that are still shooting during the WGA strike may also be forced to pause if the actors union SAG-AFTRA fails to reach a deal on a new labor contract during its ongoing talks with the studio labor representatives at the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. SAG-AFTRA\u2019s members have overwhelmingly authorized their leaders to order a strike if it cannot reach an agreement after the current labor contract expires on June 30.\n\nIn addition to forcing a pause on all productions, an actors\u2019 strike would also affect the publicity campaigns for several late summer films and for the upcoming Emmy nominations, which will be announced on July 12.\n\n\u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d will not be one of the films affected, as Paramount insiders say the film\u2019s press junkets and premiere had been scheduled before the June 30 SAG-AFTRA deadline for several months for unrelated reasons. But other July and August films, such as Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cBlue Beetle,\u201d as well as Universal\u2019s Christopher Nolan film \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d may have their publicity plans disrupted.\n\n\u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d hits theaters on July 12, with \u201cPart Two\u201d currently scheduled for release on June 28, 2024."

One scene in Dead Reckoning, which Tom filmed in real life, sees the A-lister drive a motorcycle off a cliff.\n\nWhile Tom volunteers himself for the very nerve-wracking scenes, he has to go through director and longtime collaborator Christopher McQuarrie to get them off the ground (literally), and according to the filmmaker, there were a number of stunts he regrets signing off on.\n\nWhile chatting at the UK premiere in London in June, Christopher told virginradio.co.uk that they both said yes to stunts, no matter how dangerous... but not without some trepidation.\n\nHe explained: \u201cThere were a number of stunts I have suggested which I then later regretted ever having brought up. But [Tom will] rise to any challenge, anything you throw at him, he's excited to try.\u201d\n\nOn whether he\u2019s ever felt scared watching Tom at work while on land, sea or air, Christopher admitted it\u2019s not always easy viewing seeing the megastar put himself through dangerous situations.\n\nChristopher added: \u201cIt's definitely frightening. It's more frightening in retrospect. You're so focused on all of the many moving parts and eliminating all of the variables. You just have to live in the moment. You just have to be very, very present and in the present time.\n\n\u201cYou might have the time to think about what could have gone wrong, but the movie keeps going. I'm sure some time a couple of years from now, I'll look back on this and think, what was I thinking? Until then, we just have to finish the movie.\u201d\n\nShaun of the Dead actor Simon Pegg was also on the red carpet for the premiere where he spoke about the lead actor's stunts.\n\nDescribing Cruise as \"a one off,\" Pegg said: \"Tom never comes to a stunt without having spent months practising, rehearsing, training, you know, so anytime he does anything, it would require that level of commitment. And I don't know if I have it, I mean, he's a one off, I need to be sitting in an armchair watching the TV, you know, he would never do that.\"\n\nFor more Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One news, make sure you tune into The Chris Evans Breakfast Show with cinch tomorrow (Friday 7th July) from 6:30am to hear from M:I star Hayley Atwell.\n\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1 is out in cinemas on Monday 10th July."

He took my grandmother on a helicopter ride on Christmas Eve over London. That's pretty amazing. People don't often hear those kinds of stories of how generous and kind he is off off-screen.\"\n\nRELATED:\n\nHayley adds how it changed the dynamic on set, saying: \"I think that he knows that if you're creating an environment where people feel seen, they feel like it's a welcoming one, it's a wholesome one because friends and family are welcome.\n\n\"And in that world, it's going to provide an environment where people really feel creatively free.

While Mission: Impossible II was shot in Sydney 24 years ago, Hayley agrees it's time to bring the franchise back to Australia.\n\n\"Oh God yeah!\" she says enthusiastically. \"This would be an amazing place to shoot, and I think what's beautiful about these movies is everywhere they shoot, it's a love letter to that location. And you hire local crew, and then we as actors have the privilege of coming and spending actual real-time here. So, getting immersed in the culture, getting immersed in the sights and the architecture and the geography of a place \u2013 oh my God, I'd love it if it was here! Let's try to make that happen.\"\n\nSimon Pegg, who just missed out on shooting in Australia as he joined the franchise for its third instalment, agrees, telling us: \"Heck yeah! That's all we said yesterday as we were walking up the coastal road at Bondi, I was like, 'We need to make the film here!' It would be so much fun.\"\n\n\"The open space is beautiful,\" Pom Klementieff, another newcomer to the franchise, adds.\n\nTom reveals he 'doesn't mind being scared'\n\nTom performing his biggest stunt to date in Norway for the film. Photo: Paramount Pictures (Christian Black)\n\nWhile Tom is known to do all of his own stunts, Hayley and Pom also did their fair share of insane scenes, with Hayley telling us one scene that terrified her takes place with Tom on a train towards the end of the film.\n\n\"There's a moment when the vertical train carriage \u2013 so train has gone from horizontal to vertical in six seconds \u2013 and [Tom's] asking me to jump across this kind of gaping carriage which goes into a ravine at the bottom. And in one take he just went, 'Do you trust me?' and I was [furiously shakes head, before slowly nodding], 'I mean, sure!' And [my reaction is] real. Mission: Impossible is a metaphor for the making of a Mission: Impossible film and that's why it's edge-of-your-seat stuff, the whole way.\"\n\nPom, who appears in the Guardians of the Galaxy films, is very comfortable with stunts and has been described by a fan as the female Tom Cruise, as she's a bit of a daredevil herself and loves skydiving and riding motorcycles.\n\nPom Klementieff is new to the Mission: Impossible franchise and has made a name for herself as 'the female Tom Cruise' thanks to her daredevil attitude.

I did it on Top Gun [Maverick], I went flying with the Blue Angels and did the high-speed manoeuvres to understand what G's were like. But in [Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning] Part Two, I had to do one of the stunts because just the physics of it were so particular I couldn't write the sequences until I did it.\"\n\nChristopher also shares his \"scariest\" memory from his many years working with Tom, saying, \"The absolute scariest one was [Mission: Impossible - Fallout] \u2013 the helicopter chase in Fallout, only because I was in the helicopter chasing him and that was that was quite a unique experience.\"\n\nMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One is in cinemas July 8.\n\nNever miss a thing.

    "text": "ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 The red carpet unfurled Monday in Abu Dhabi for Hollywood action megastar Tom Cruise, who was on hand for the Middle Eastern premiere of \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One.\u201d\n\nCruise was met by an enthusiastic crowd of fans and movie buffs eager to catch a glimpse of the star at the Emirates Palace Hotel in the capital of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nDressed in a tailored tuxedo and flashing his signature smile, Cruise appeared moved by the exuberant reception, stopping to speak with many attendees. The evening\u2019s buzz was punctuated by the \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d theme, its familiar chords adding a layer of cinematic nostalgia to the night.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a cinephile, I love movies and the history of cinema and how this art form develops,\u201d Cruise told The Associated Press on the red carpet. \u201cI didn\u2019t know whether the audience was going to embrace (the first Mission: Impossible movie), it was the first film I ever produced and I did it because I wanted to challenge myself in many ways as an actor, as a producer, as a storyteller.\u201d\n\n\u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d is the seventh installment of the blockbuster $3.5 billion grossing franchise famed for jam-packed action and ever-daring stunts performed by the 60-year-old Cruise himself.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of fun coming up with these moments,\u201d said Cruise.\n\nThe Mission: Impossible series follows the globe-trotting adventures of Ethan Hunt, a secret agent of the Impossible Missions Force, or IMF, as he undertakes high-risk covert operations. Picture heart-racing action, sophisticated gadgets, and Cruise\u2019s Hunt executing death-defying stunts at every turn.\n\nMatching the topic of the moment, Hunt and his IMF team are tasked with tracking down a potent new artificial intelligence weapon in \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One.\u201d Scenes include base-jumping off a cliff on a motorcycle, hurling a steam train off an exploded bridge, and drifting a yellow Fiat 500 through Rome\u2019s winding streets.\n\nIn a nod to the locale, the film incorporates several action sequences in Abu Dhabi. The desert landscapes of Liwa, known as the Empty Quarter, set the stage for intense horseback chases and firearm confrontations. Cruise runs across the dune-shaped roof of Abu Dhabi International Airport\u2019s new Midfield Terminal in another scene.\n\n\u201cWhen you see us shooting a sequence in Abu Dhabi, it\u2019s about that culture, it\u2019s about that country, and that\u2019s why we keep coming back here,\u201d said Christopher McQuarrie, who is returning for the third time as director of the high-octane spy series.\n\nMcQuarrie joined Cruise on the red carpet along with other Mission: Impossible co-stars, both new and returning. Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff made their franchise debut, while Simon Pegg reprised his role as Benji Dunn, a character known for infusing comedic relief into the franchise\u2019s most tense scenes.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a film which is high-tension you need that to occasionally be injected in order to make it a little bit more enjoyable,\u201d said Pegg.\n\nFollowing pandemic delays, the production companies behind the franchise, Paramount Pictures and Skydance, pushed the film\u2019s release from September of 2022 to July of 2023. A leaked video from the set featured Cruise launching an expletive-laden rant at colleagues after he reportedly spotted two crew members failing to respect social distancing rules. The star expressed his concern about the potential consequences, which included shutting down production and jeopardizing the then-struggling movie industry and the jobs it supports.\n\n\u201cWe just had to write the rulebook on how to make a film during a pandemic,\u201d said Pegg. \u201cMake sure everything was super safe, that was Tom\u2019s biggest challenge in a way was to make us all feel safe and be safe, somehow we muddle through.\u201d\n\nCruise was praised by many for his role in revitalizing Hollywood following the industry\u2019s pandemic-induced stagnation. This recognition came on the heels of his blockbuster film, \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d which not only marked Cruise\u2019s first $100 million debut but also signified the return of blockbuster movies to theaters as the most significant movie debut since the onset of the pandemic.\n\nAbu Dhabi marks the third premiere location for \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One,\u201d with the red carpet previously rolled out at the Spanish Steps in Rome and Leicester Square in London. The movie is set to open in U.S. theaters on July 12."

    "text": "Hayley Atwell tells Chris Evans she was picked to star in Mission: Impossible YEARS before being cast\n\nVirgin Radio\n\n7 Jul 2023, 12:09\n\nHayley Atwell has shared how Tom Cruise and collaborator Christopher McQuarrie already had big plans to introduce her into the Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One.\n\nThe Marvel star plays M:I newcomer Grace, who initially ends up on the wrong side of Cruise\u2019s Ethan Hunt, before the two have to come together to stop a deadly AI programme from destroying humanity.\n\nIt turns out that Hayley came along before Grace was even conceptualised, and while chatting on The Chris Evans Breakfast Show with cinch, the actress dished on how Cruise and Mission: Impossible 7 director McQuarrie ended up handpicking her for the exciting new role.\n\nShe explained: \u201c10 years ago, I was in a play, The Pride at Trafalgar Studios here in London and Chris McQuarrie, longtime collaborator of Tom Cruise, came to see it, took me out for dinner and said, \u2018I love what you do on that stage, I want to find a character for you\u2019.\u201d\n\nSix years went by, and Hayley then received a phone call from McQuarrie saying he and Cruise were desperate to get her in for a screen test for their next big blockbuster.\n\nOn the rather unique process, Hayley shared: \u201cThey don't have a character that they're looking for someone to fit into. They find the actor they want to work with, who understands the process of this world. Then they'll collaborate and create the character as you go along.\n\n\u201cWhat that meant for me was that I just went, \u2018Okay, well, I'll just try a tonne of different things every day and see what sticks.\u2019 For the longest time, I didn't have a character name. I didn't know if she was going to be a villain, if she had any moral compass, who her allegiance would be to. That made her sort of consistently inconsistent. There\u2019s a spontaneity that gives her that sort of freshness, because it's literally sort of making up as I go along.\u201d\n\nWhat followed would be intensive training not just for stunts but for driving too, with Hayley behind the wheel (and handcuffed) to Cruise during one scene in a Fiat 500 in Italy.\n\nYou might expect to find it comforting to share a stunt scene with king-of-action himself Cruise, but according to Hayley, he was the cause of a car crash while the pair were filming.\n\nShe explained: \u201cThere would be times when we'd have three cameras on the windscreen. My vision was impaired. I\u2019d be drifting and doing donuts, and then he'd be saying lines to me, but I would have to work out whether it was Tom telling Haley to slow down like something serious had happened or whether he was saying it to me as his character, or he was saying it to me to suggest a line for my character to say. That\u2019s why you've got my performance just going, \u2018what is happening?!\u2019 It was great fun.\n\n\u201cThere's a moment in the car. Tom actually crashed it because it had a mind of its own. It's such a dangerous little beast. We nicknamed it Trixie. We stopped and he just went well, \u2018I guess that's the end of the shooting day for today.\u2019 It ended up being in the film because it was such a fun, funny, spontaneous moment. Nothing got damaged, everyone was safe, so we're like this is great. Let's use it!\u201d\n\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is out in cinemas on Monday 10th July.\n\nFor more great interviews listen to The Chris Evans Breakfast Show with cinch weekdays from 6:30am on Virgin Radio, or catch up on-demand here."

    "text": "Henry Cavill\u2019s charisma as Superman and his silent yet powerful presence in The Witcher has made him popular not just with fans but also with the Hollywood fraternity. The British star has been lauded by many of his co-actors, directors he has worked with, and filmmakers who are yet to collaborate with him.\n\nMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One director Christopher McQuarrie is among Henry Cavill\u2019s ardent admirers. The filmmaker had high words of praise for the Man of Steel star and his personality and gave an insight into Cavill\u2019s X-factor that made him stand out.\n\nAlso Read: Henry Cavill\u2019s Superman Replacement David Corenswet Was Panicking Before His S*x Scene With 74-Year-Old Actress Patti LuPone: \u201cThat\u2019s a beautiful s*x scene\u201d\n\nDirector Christopher McQuarrie\u2019s Assessment Of Henry Cavill\n\nIt is no secret that Henry Cavill has made a long-lasting impression in Hollywood with his two marquee roles as Superman in the DCU and Geralt of Rivia in The Witcher. The star\u2019s arresting good looks combined with his charismatic personality has led to many of his colleagues in the film fraternity lauding him. Apart from Zack Snyder who called him \u201cwarrior monk\u201d, Mission: Impossible 7 director Christopher McQuarrie had words of praise for Henry Cavill and his work ethic. To quote McQuarrie,\n\nFandomwire Video\n\n\u201cHenry is a classic movie star. It\u2019s not like there was something in the water in the 1930s and \u201940s that there isn\u2019t today. Movie stars are not as abundant now for two simple reasons: The industry wanted and cultivated stars, and there were people ready to do the work required to be stars. Henry is in the category of somebody hell-bent on doing the work, and that work is hard.\u201d\n\nThe director\u2019s keen perception of Cavill\u2019s success proved to be the perfect assessment of the actor who looks to be one of Hollywood\u2019s most bankable stars.\n\nAlso Read: \u201cI was raised with a lot of Buddhist influences\u201d: Before Henry Cavill Fans Ripped Him to Shreds, DC\u2019s New Superman David Corenswet Revealed Secret to Zen Mindset\n\nHenry Cavill And Superman Were Destined To Find Each Other\n\nHenry Cavill has been widely regarded as the perfect choice to play DC\u2019s most celebrated superhero. The character though was always part of his destiny. While the actor made his DC debut in 2013 with Man of Steel, he was considered to play the character many years before that when Terminator Salvation Director McG was tipped to helm a DC project involving Superman. The film did not materialize and Cavill in a interview, spoke of the reasons behind it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how close I came. I understand it was very, very close and sadly the movie was canceled because McG didn\u2019t want to fly. He certainly had a big fear of flying at the time; I think he\u2019s since overcome it.\u201d\n\nAfter Cavill\u2019s departure as Superman, the next actor to take on the prestigious role has arrived. It now remains to be seen how James Gunn\u2019s new Superman recruit David Corenswet will fare in comparison to the Man of Steel actor\u2019s memorable portrayal.\n\nAlso Read: Henry Cavill Named His Rescue Pet After Batman Star Ben Affleck for a Surprising Reason Before Filming Zack Snyder\u2019s $873M Movie\n\nSource: The Hollywood Reporter"

However, in an interview with Screen Rant, Christopher McQuarrie disclosed his enthusiasm for collaborating with Henry Cavill, expressing his eagerness to seize such an opportunity.\n\nFandomwire Video\n\n\u201cTo me, I\u2019m interested in a good story.

I go through the door that opens,\u201d he said.\n\nMcQuarrie\u2019s association with another DC film, Green Lantern Corps, was also a subject of speculation, with rumors of his frequent collaborator Tom Cruise potentially taking on a leading role.\n\n\u201cYou know, I got to say, Tom and I have never talked about it. We always kind of talk about what we\u2019re working on or what we\u2019re talking about working on next. I think, again, I think if you show them a good story, I think if you showed him a really emotional story, I don\u2019t think, you know, it\u2019s, I can never predict.

I was fully just expecting amazing stunts and cool locations, but the emotional journey the audience is going on is, for me, what sends it into a whole other stratosphere.\"\n\nSimon Pegg, who plays Benji in the series, agrees that Mission: Impossible\u2019s scope and scale keeps getting bigger and bigger.\n\n\"It did feel different,\" Pegg says. \"Not just because we were making it when we made it, but you know Tom [Cruise] and [director Christopher McQuarrie] are never going to rest on what they\u2019ve done before. They\u2019re going to push it forward. Every film, when it ends, we get asked 'What\u2019s next?' and we think, 'Well, what could we possibly do?'\"\n\nDespite the \"enormity\" of the movie, Elwes \u2013 who has appeared in everything from The Princess Bride to Stranger Things \u2013 was struck by how nonplussed director Christopher McQuarrie was by the globetrotting production.\n\n\"There was never a bead of sweat on his head, not once,\" Elwes reveals. \"We had to deal with all kinds of things then \u2013 COVID, all kinds of logistical things \u2013 that a huge production of this nature entails. The guy never broke a sweat. He was totally, totally chill the whole time. So he set the tone on-set and so everyone felt [like] this is great, this is just a fun day at work.\"\n\nFor more from Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, check out our coverage on:"

    "text": "The latest action-heavy trailer for \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d has arrived ahead of its Wednesday premiere.\n\nUnlike the official trailer for the action flick, this latest promotional trailer solely highlights the movie\u2019s action. As the video cuts between Tom Cruise performing seemingly impossible stunts like running on an exploding train and motorcycling off the edge of a cliff, snippets of reviews play appear onscreen. The new teaser doesn\u2019t appear to offer any new footage that hasn\u2019t appeared in the first trailer, but it does emphasize Cruise\u2019s stunts.\n\nSet to debut later this week, the movie is averaging a 99% on Rotten Tomatoes. This latest installment in the spy action franchise was directed by Christopher McQuarrie and co-written by McQuarrie and Erik Jendresen. It serves as a direct sequel to 2018\u2019s \u201cMission: Impossible: Fallout\u201d and follows Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his IMF team as their confronted by a seemingly all-powerful rival known as \u201cThe Entity.\u201d\n\nAlso Read:\n\nSimon Pegg Says Watching Tom Cruise Stunts Is a \u2018Terrifying Experience\u2019 (Video)\n\nIn addition to Cruise, the movie stars Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Esai Morales, Vanessa Kirby, Pom Klementieff and Henry Czerny. Skydance and TC Productions produced the film with Paramount Pictures distributing it. \u201cDead Reckoning Part One\u201d marks the first \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d movie without J.J. Abrams\u2019 involvment.\n\nBoth of the \u201cDead Reckoning\u201d films were shot back-to-back with McQuarrie writing and directing. Filming initially began in February of 2020 but was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With a budget of $290 million, it also ranks among one of the most expensive movies ever made.\n\n\u201cDead Reckoning Part One\u201d will mark the seventh movie in the \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d franchise. Based on the 1966 TV series of the same name, the first \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d premiered in 1996 and became an instant hit with audiences despite its middling reviews.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt ranked as the third highest-grossing film released that year and was only out-earned by \u201cIndependence Day\u201d and \u201cTwister.\u201d The original movie was then followed by \u201cMission: Impossible 2,\u201d \u201cMission: Impossible III,\u201d \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Ghost Protocol,\u201d \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Rogue Nation,\u201d \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Fallout\u201d and now \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One.\u201d\n\nPart Two is expected to debut June 28, 2024.\n\nAlso Read:\n\n\u2018Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\u2019 Is Now the Top Summer Film at the Domestic Box Office"

She\u2019s a rebel, she\u2019s a killer, she\u2019s extremely skilled and quite lonely too.\u201d\n\nKlementieff said her film name is an homage to Leonard Nimoy, who played the Great Paris on the original Mission: Impossible TV show. \u201cWhen Christopher McQuarrie cast me for the role, he didn\u2019t know which name the character would have,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was cool to name me Paris, me being from France, and then they decided that I would speak French because I speak French in real life.\u201d\n\nMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One will hit theaters July 12."

USA, following a series of struggles filming at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. And while the stars had some difficult moments adapting to the many challenges at the time, their most special memories seem to come from the particular way of filming the story, as they revealed that they did not follow a normal script.

USA. \u201cObviously [Christopher] McQuarrie is the director, he is also the writer. And so he knows the shape at least of it, and the large of the set pieces,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt would always be \u2018Oh today you\u2019re gonna learn how to drive a boat in Venice,\u2019 that was surprising, that kind of stuff was surprising.\u201d\n\nPom Klementieff, who plays Paris, explained that \u201cthe story is always changing,\u201d and the cast would have \u201congoing conversations\u201d with Tom Cruise and McQuarrie. \u201cThere is kind of a vision for it, but you kind of discover it in the moment,\u201d Vanessa Kirby said, talking about her experience playing Alanna.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know exactly where we were gonna go with it. It was trying to figure out where our characters would go every step of the way,\u201d Tarzan Davis explained, referring to his character, Davis, and his dynamic with Shea Whigham, who plays Jasper. \u201cThey [McQuarrie and Cruise] almost reversed-engineered the way you think film should be made. They follow the story as it\u2019s unfolding, so you don\u2019t really sit down and read a script. They built a script around what\u2019s happening in accordance to relationships and how things are going, so it\u2019s unlike any movie that you will ever make,\u201d Whigham added."

    "text": "Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One is heading to theaters this month, and the first reviews are quite promising. The movie is currently up on Rotten Tomatoes with a 98% critics score after 119 reviews. The seventh Mission: Impossible film marks the third to be helmed by Christopher McQuarrie, who is also tackling the upcoming Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part Two. Recently, the director spoke with Collider and revealed which movies inspired the latest installment to the action franchise.\n\n\"There are films I am inspired by, competing with, in a sportsman-like way, kind of friendly. There are films that I deeply, deeply admire and kind of get stuck in my head. I love movies about the Arctic, I love movies about submarines. Submarines are just cool. The Arctic is just cool. I love The Thing, but I can't really say that The Thing is an influence on Dead Reckoning. I love Das Boot and Crimson Tide, submarines are an amazing high-pressure environment, I can't really say that they're influences on the movie. They're gauntlets. It's a filmmaker showing me some cool environment and me going, 'I want to do that! I want my opportunity to play in that space.'\"\n\nMcQuarrie went on to say that he could list \"a million movies\" that inspire him, but he doesn't directly reference any other films in Dead Reckoning. However, Mission: Impossible \u2013 Rogue Nation did have direct nods to The Parallax View and Three Days of the Condor. As for the yellow Fiat 500 in Dead Reckoning, some fans thought that was a reference to Lupin the Third, but McQuarrie says that's just a coincidence. He explained, \"The Fiat is yellow because it's a really distinct, fun color and that's about it. I didn't really know about Lupin the Third.\"\n\nHe added of the movies that inspire him, \"I see a lot of John Ford in there. I see a lot of Steven Spielberg, Close Encounters, where I'm suddenly looking at something and where I wasn't intending for that to happen. I'm seeing the ghosts of that stuff in there.\"\n\nChristopher McQuarrie Explains Why Dead Reckoning Is in Two Parts:\n\nDuring another interview with Collider, McQuarrie explained why Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning has been split into two parts.\n\n\"Well, we knew with Fallout. Fallout really grew because of all the character and emotion we were putting into the story, all the things that we had discovered in Rogue Nation that was so unexpected,\" McQuarrie shared. \"I knew I wanted to expand the cast, and I knew I wanted to give each one of those characters more to do, so I knew the movie was going to be bigger and longer than Fallout.\"\n\n\"And at which point I said, 'Why are we fighting this? Why are we going to try to jam this into two hours? Let's just break it in half and make it two movies.' That really was the rationale behind it being a two-part movie. It just it wasn't just that the story was bigger but that we wanted more emotion in the movie,\" he added.\n\n\"Yeah, it's massive, and it was complicated by the fact that certain things in Part Two required stopping Part One to shoot them, whether it was because of weather or actor availability. And so, with all the other challenges that were confronting this movie while we were making it, there was the challenge of stopping in the middle, not even knowing what the full movie was, and trying to predict what it was in the second film. It's a testament to how great this team is and how patient this cast is. It's really something,\" McQuarrie explained.\n\nWhat Is Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning About?\n\nTom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, which premieres in theaters on July 12th. It's the beginning of the end for the action-packed franchise, as Cruise reteams with longtime collaborator and filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie for more death-defying and breathtaking stunts. Hunt and allies Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) attempt to track down a new weapon with the power to tear the world apart. Actors Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, and Esai Morales join the cast for the latest installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise, which is set to wrap up with Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part Two."

    "text": "If you're a fan of action movies, you surely know the Mission Impossible series, starring the one and only Tom Cruise. The upcoming Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One's premiere was held on June 19 in Rome, one of the locations where it was filmed. Abarth appeared alongside the movie stars, specifically two of its models featured in the movie.\n\nPhoto: Abarth\n\nkWh\n\nEV\n\nkW\n\nAbarth two main characters are the new all-electric Abarth 500e and the iconic 1960s Fiat 500 Abarth. The latter can also be seen in the movie's trailer in a high-speed pursuit.The Mission Impossible series is synonymous with non-stop action. In this next installment, Ethan Hunt ( Tom Cruise ) and his IMF team have to face yet another threat that, of course, threatens all humanity. Ethan has to put the importance of his mission ahead of the lives of those he cares about most, something he struggles with considering.The movie is written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, the mind behind the latest Mission Impossible films and the Jack Reacher movies, also starring Tom Cruise. Dead Reckoning Part One was shot in Rome, London , Abu Dhabi, and several other locations and will hit movie theaters across the globe on July 12.It's no coincidence that Abarth partnered up with Mission Impossible \u2013 the Italian brand is all about thrilling driving experiences, just like the ones the audience will enjoy in the upcoming film. The goal is to emphasize the common feeling shared by both brands: adrenaline, power, exciting driving, and extraordinary performance.These values will be showcased in \"Mission Possible,\" a new TV spot where Abarth wants to demonstrate that the new 500e can offer the same excitement, emotions, and fun as a conventional version, making it a \"Mission Possible.\"The Abarth 500e was launched in November last year with a 152-hp (155-ps) electric motor and a 42-battery. This combo allows theto speed up to 62 mph (100 kph) from a standstill in just seven seconds. The 500e has a range of up to 165 miles (265 km), and it can be recharged at up to 85when hooked to DC mains.Initially, Abarth unveiled the Scorpionissima launch edition, which sold out in the meanwhile. Later, the brand came up with two other regular variants , the 500e and the 500e Turismo, offered as hatchbacks or cabriolets.Both models are available with the controversial Sound Generator, the result of more than 6,000 hours of development work. The system was engineered \"to reproduce the legendary sound of the Abarth engine.\" Some say it's a cool feature, while others believe it creates a fake experience. Either way, the driver can turn it on and off, so no harm is done."

    "text": "In \"Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning\" superstar Tom Cruise once again does his own stunts. He's not the only one.\n\nThe new mission echoes the world's current AI concerns: In \"Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One,\" Tom Cruise plays agent Ethan Hunt for the seventh time, fighting against a computer program that has gotten out of control and is threatening to wipe out humanity.\n\nThe \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise is a recipe for success for Hollywood. One of the aspects that makes the series so popular is that Tom Cruise performs many of the film stunts himself, without the aid of CGI or stunt doubles. That approach has turned him into an action megastar.\n\nDaring action scenes\n\nUnforgettable scenes in the previous movies include Tom Cruise climbing up the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai, or hanging from a plane as it takes off.\n\nIn 'Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol' (2011), Tom Cruise climbs up the world's tallest building Image: David James/Paramount Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection/picture alliance\n\nA highlight of the new film combines a motorcycle stunt and a parachute jump.\n\nLike the \"John Wick\" films with Keanu Reeves, the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise counters the trend of having blockbuster action scenes created exclusively through CGI.\n\nCruise is perhaps the most famous action star doing his own stunts today. But other actors, including older ones, also insist on filming dangerous sequences themselves in order to make the movie feel more authentic.\n\nJackie Chan: Stunt legend despite serious accident\n\nThis includes Chinese martial arts legend Jackie Chan, who has insisted on doing practically all of his stunts himself since the 1970s.\n\nHis most notable performances are in \"Snake in the Eagle's Shadow\" (1978), \"Police Story\" and \"Police Story 2\" (1985 and 1988) and \"Armour of God\" (1986).\n\nDuring the filming of the latter, Chan almost died while filming a relatively simple stunt. Jumping from a ledge onto a tree, he fell and crashed onto a rock, breaking a few ribs and cracking his skull.\n\nJackie Chan in 'Amour of God,' 1986 Image: Everett Collection/picture alliance\n\nMichelle Yeoh: Former 'Bond girl' and martial arts legend\n\nIn her Oscar-winning role in \"Everything Everywhere All at Once,\" 60-year-old Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh portrays a laundromat owner who in an alternate universe is also a famous martial arts movie star \u2014 inspired by the actress' own career.\n\nMichelle Yeoh in 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' (2000), which will be re-released in theaters in 2023 Image: Columbia Films/Entertainment Pictures/ZUMAPRESS/picture alliance\n\nYeoh, who is also among the stars renowned for performing stunts herself, played alongside Jackie Chan in action classics like \"Police Story 3: Supercop\" or \"Supercop 2.\" She rose to international prominence with the 2000 martial arts film, \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\" in which she also did her own stunts.\n\nKeanu Reeves: 'I do all of the action'\n\nCanadian actor Keanu Reeves doesn't shy away from getting his hands dirty in action-packed scenes either. In films like \"Speed\" (1994), \"Matrix\" (1999) or the \"John Wick\" series, he jumps out of moving cars and fights his opponents in nerve-wracking scenes.\n\nIn 'Chain Reaction' (1996), Reeves escapes an explosion on a motorcycle Image: TBM/United Archives/picture alliance\n\nFollowing the release of \"John Wick 3,\" Reeves confirmed in an interview that he did almost all of the stunt work himself: \"I do all of the action. I'm 90 percent of what's happening there. I'm maintaining the connection to the audience, and with the story.\"\n\nHarrison Ford: Stuntman at 80\n\n\"Indiana Jones\" star Harrison Ford can't be left out of any list of actors performing their own stunts.\n\nThe 80-year-old actor has had an impressive film career spanning six decades. His most successful films include the \"Star Wars\" saga and the \"Indiana Jones\" series.\n\nHarrison Ford shot this iconic opening scene from 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' 10 times Image: Paramount/Everett Collection/picture alliance\n\nThe opening scene of the first Indiana Jones movie,\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" is particularly iconic, with Harrison Ford running away from a giant boulder that is chasing him. Even though the rock was a prop, it was still heavy enough to seriously injure the actor, who was not doubled in the scene.\n\nFord completely immersed himself in the role of daredevil archeologist Indiana Jones.\n\nIn the recently released \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,\" he still took over many stunts himself, dislocating his shoulder while filming. But for real action stars, that's just part of the job.\n\nThis article was originally written in German."

    "text": "Since \u201cMission: Impossible III\u201d in 2006, Simon Pegg has been part of the core ensemble of the \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d franchise, playing hacker and sometime field agent Benji Dunn opposite its stalwart star Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt. Pegg was never going to be the actor risking life and limb on screen \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s Benji\u2019s job to be the one that actually says, \u2018what the fuck are we doing here?\u2019,\u201d he observes. But over five installments of the indefatigable series, his character has shifted from questioning what Ethan is doing in the moment to believing absolutely in why he\u2019s doing it, thanks in no small part to the writing and directing of Christopher McQuarrie.\n\nMcQuarrie came onto \u201cGhost Protocol\u201d as \u201ca sort of master plumber to re-wriggle the pipes,\u201d as Pegg characterizes it, and since became the series\u2019 ongoing co-architect with Cruise. Their partnership reaches its peak, even if by all indications it\u2019s far from over, with \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One,\u201d half of an operatic culmination of narrative seeds planted since Cruise first played Hunt back in 1996. In a conversation with Variety, Pegg discusses what makes McQuarrie\u2019s creativity so special, and his collaboration with Cruise et al so unique; he also talks about new details he discovered about Benji, explored the challenges of being self-referential in a franchise like this without undermining emotional stakes, and hinted at what is yet to come as he and the rest of the filmmaking team move on to \u201cDead Reckoning \u2014 Part Two.\u201d\n\nYou said that you have shot at least some of these films without a script. What\u2019s actually there for you to work from, and what\u2019s the minimum you need to play a scene without knowing what it might connect to?\n\nWe never don\u2019t have a script on the day of the shoot. The scene will have been written and we would\u2019ve had time to learn it. It\u2019s more that McQ allows the locations we go to, the characters, the actors he\u2019s working with to help him tell the story. He\u2019ll let the story be revealed to him by, say, looking at the streets of Rome or the canals of Venice. It\u2019s a fly by the seat of your pants way of working because you\u2019ve got a rough idea of what you\u2019re doing, but the minutia doesn\u2019t come sometimes until the last minute. But that\u2019s part of being an actor, and I enjoy that \u2014 we have a mission impossible going alongside our \u201cMission: Impossible.\u201d But it\u2019s never not in McQ\u2019s head. He\u2019s not making it up as he goes along, by any means. It\u2019s all in there, you just have to tease it out gradually.\n\nThinking about the screenwriting that you\u2019ve done, Chris\u2019 shares in common this very Swiss-watch precision to it.\n\nWhen Edgar Wright and I write together, we have the Swiss watch laid out on a table and we do it like that. McQ throws it in the air and assembles it as it falls, and it\u2019s extremely educating for me as a filmmaker because it\u2019s the antithesis of what Edgar and I do. That\u2019s partly because a lot of Edgar\u2019s transitions are very precise so we need to know how each scene starts and finishes so that it can dovetail into the next one. But it certainly made me aware that sometimes you can allow the situation to help inform the narrative or the dialogue. That\u2019s because McQ is a master problem solver. If you give him a broken script, he just rubs his hands with glee. If you give him a blank page, he\u2019ll scratch his head. It\u2019s just how he is \u2014 he\u2019s an absolute master.\n\nIt seems like it shouldn\u2019t be quite so unique for Christopher to be able to deliver these smart, muscular, inventive action movies, but it is. What is it that makes McQ\u2019s creativity so singular?\n\nI think in Tom, he\u2019s just found such a perfect creative partner, someone who can facilitate that way of working, can allow him to practice this extreme method of filmmaking. I remember when we were making \u201cGhost Protocol\u201d and the script on that just wasn\u2019t very focused, and Tom brought in McQ, a sort of master plumber to re-wriggle the pipes. And it was on that that their creative romance really took off. They\u2019re both eternal students of film and just methods of filmmaking, methods of storytelling, certain camera rigs. I remember when we shot \u201cRogue Nation,\u201d we were still using film. The cameras were quite cumbersome. Now, you can put a camera on a motorbike and just send it off a cliff and go down and pick it out of the undergrowth. And they\u2019re forever absorbing these new methods of telling the story. So I just think they found each other \u2014 in a way that Lennon and McCartney found each other, if I could really hyperbolize.\n\n\u201cDead Reckoning\u201d feels like it\u2019s ramping up to bring full circle these ideas and themes that the series has been exploring since the very first film. Have there been callbacks or references that you particularly enjoyed being a part of?\n\nThe interesting thing about the initial phase of this story was that it was an eclectic showcase of separate directors, and then it morphed into something with greater continuity in terms of Chris and Tom\u2019s collaboration. But Chris has always had a great understanding of the importance of the legacy, and so we have Henry Czerny back for this one, which is so cool to see Kittridge back, and Henry\u2019s such a brilliant actor. And also, the acknowledgement of where Ethan came from, this idea that the IMF agents are kind of offered a choice, which is usually prison, death or joining the IMF. And we came up with Benji\u2019s whole backstory, that he was a hacker in the UK who broke into a sensitive database in the US and got extradited to be tried criminally and then was offered the choice. And so they\u2019re striving to move forward, but also the embracing of the history of it, I think really kind of singles this story out, I think, in franchise cinema.\n\nDoes Chris give you a sense of the road he\u2019s mapping, or do you even need that at this point when you learn the details of, say, Benji\u2019s origin story with the IMF?\n\nMcQ\u2019s method of filmmaking is like in Wallace and Gromit\u2019s \u201cThe Wrong Trousers\u201d when Gromit is on the top of the train and he\u2019s laying the track in front of the train as it\u2019s moving. I think McQ loves to have the story reveal itself to him, and those beautiful little parallels and callbacks aren\u2019t necessarily preordained \u2014 they just kind of present themselves. McQ\u2019s really keen to evolve the story in a very organic way and never to cram anything in. If it feels right, we\u2019ll do it. If it feels like it\u2019s just fan service or it\u2019s just some kind of tenuous link, which doesn\u2019t quite ring true, then it won\u2019t find its way in.\n\nOn the other hand, the movie pokes very gentle fun at the idea that the IMF team has gone rogue more than it simply just followed a mission. Have there been other tropes you felt it probably was time to actually admit to as opposed to just sweeping past that choice?\n\nI\u2019m so glad they made the IMF joke in this because the International Monetary Fund has become more of a presence in the news, and it felt like it had to be addressed. But something like the mask gag, which is probably the most absurd thing in all \u201cMission: Impossible,\u201d the idea that you could literally just immediately look like someone else, I love the fact that we utterly commit to that device in such a way that it rings true. I think if we ever went, wait a minute, how could you look so much like [that person]? It would spoil it. We are not a self-reflexive series. There\u2019s a little bit of that occasionally when it\u2019s required, but I think sometimes being arch reflects a lack of confidence in your own story. If you don\u2019t have the confidence in the absurdity of your story, no one else is going to. And certainly with the mask gag, you\u2019ve just got to commit.\n\nOne of the things that you do in this film is ride in a self-driving car. Why would Benji do that if it could be manipulated by The Entity?\n\nThat\u2019s why he puts his seatbelt on. We had that thought, and we even spoke about the idea of The Entity hacking the car whilst Benji was in it. But I think he has to just do a Hail Mary and hope The Entity isn\u2019t listening. I mean, fortunately, they\u2019re using kind of analog comms, so with a bit of luck The Entity won\u2019t be able to infiltrate the car. But I think it\u2019s that moment of Benji thinking, you know what? I\u2019m just going to pop on my belt, and that was our a way of saying, yes, we know.\n\nHow important are those plot redundancies? Is there a certain threshold where telling a story that\u2019s exciting is more important than every single screw fitting into every little round hole?\n\nTom and McQ are incredibly meticulous with that kind of stuff. Obviously at times, just the sheer size of the story, the amount of characters, there are probably little holes that people can find, but we\u2019ve always got a reason like that to explain stuff. But it is important to not just rely on people\u2019s goodwill. I think you do have to try and cover every base as best you can, otherwise it\u2019s just lazy. I get annoyed when I watch movies and things happen that just wouldn\u2019t happen for whatever reason. And not necessarily great big fantasy films where you\u2019re dealing with fantastic ideas, I don\u2019t like it when characters do things they wouldn\u2019t do just to facilitate a certain plot point. And I think McQ is really good at making sure that doesn\u2019t happen with this.\n\nAfter returning to Benji so many times, what are you still learning about the character?\n\nWhat I love about McQ\u2019s writing is that he\u2019s always very true to the characters. Some people often say, \u201cdon\u2019t you want to go and do that crazy stunt?\u201d And it\u2019s like, well, maybe, but would Benji do that kind of thing? He\u2019s not Ethan. It\u2019s Benji\u2019s job to be the one that actually says, \u201cWhat the fuck are we doing here?\u201d Whereas Ethan\u2019s got to be so focused, he can\u2019t afford to take that pause. But I love the scene in this movie when Benji\u2019s defusing the bomb and it\u2019s starting to kind of grill him about his personal life. It\u2019s both a heartwarming and sinister moment because it\u2019s The Entity kind of drilling into Benji, but at the same time, you understand just how much Benji cares about who\u2019s around him. That character stuff is the secret weapon, I think, of these films. People often make a lot of the stunts, obviously, because Tom\u2019s doing incredibly daring stuff, but what Tom and McQ talk about the most is character, and that\u2019s what they obsess about the most, that\u2019s what they spend the most time working on, is making sure that the people involved in these moments of daring are people that you give a shit about. Because if you don\u2019t, then those stunts will just be hollow.\n\nPart One feels very complete even though obviously Part Two is coming. How much have you filmed of Part Two and what has the flow been from one film to the next?\n\nWe\u2019re not shooting in a pandemic, which means it\u2019s not going to take quite as long as the last one did, which is a relief. I can tell you that we\u2019ve already shot stuff which makes part one seem tame. To sit with an audience and watch Part One and know what\u2019s coming, I feel this supreme sense of dramatic irony. It\u2019s going to be extraordinary and surprising and also have the same degree of heart and character and attention to detail that Tom and McQ always bring."

    "text": "Celebrated writer Frederic Raphael has lashed out at Hollywood actor Tom Cruise , branding him an \"egocentric control freak.\" The renowned writer, known for his work on the 1999 film ' Eyes Wide Shut ,' expressed his grievances about his experience working with the late director Stanley Kubrick and criticized the chemistry between Cruise and his then-wife Nicole Kidman in the movie, despite them never having met.Raphael's scathing remarks were unveiled in a letter featured in his latest book, ' Last Post .' In the letter, he accused Tom Cruise, along with the director's wife, Christiane Harlan , and her brother Jan, of orchestrating an incessant campaign to downplay his contributions to the final version of 'Eyes Wide Shut.' The trio allegedly attempted to rewrite history and tarnish the writer's reputation by inserting derogatory content into his Wikipedia entry.The 91-year-old writer further lamented his inability to combat the libelous claims, citing a lack of modern skills and energy to do so. He decried the efforts to establish Cruise as the grand master of the film and expressed deep disappointment at being called a liar by individuals he had never even spoken to, including the Harlan clan and Tom Cruise. Raphael also made references to Cruise's involvement with Scientology, suggesting that it contributed to the actor's controlling behavior.Not stopping there, Raphael questioned Stanley Kubrick's judgment and motives in casting decisions for the film. He raised doubts about whether Kubrick admired Cruise's versatility or if he simply sought to get the best value for Warner Brothers ' money. The writer alluded to a strained working relationship between Kubrick and Cruise, implying that the actor was driven relentlessly to deliver for the studio.Moreover, Raphael criticized the director's choice to cast a real-life married couple, Cruise and Kidman, as an on-screen married couple, questioning the feasibility of portraying \"the truth\" about their relationship. He argued that public disclosures from conjugal duos rarely reveal the crucial aspects of their relationships.The writer's candid revelations have stirred up discussions about Hollywood's behind-the-scenes dynamics and the extent to which egos and control may impact artistic collaborations. However, Tom Cruise, Christiane Harlan, and Jan have yet to respond to these accusations, leaving the industry and fans wondering about the true nature of the working relationships during the making of 'Eyes Wide Shut.' As the controversy unfolds, Raphael's words serve as a reminder that even in the world of glitz and glamour, personal conflicts and power struggles can cast shadows on artistic endeavors."

    "text": "Tom Cruise famously sends his friends in Hollywood a coconut cake every year for the holidays \u2014 but for his Mission: Impossible costars, the actor-producer is even more generous.\n\nCruise, 61, is back in theaters with the seventh installment in the hit action series, Dead Reckoning Part One, with many returning cast members (Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Vanessa Kirby and Rebecca Ferguson) as well as new ones (including Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff).\n\n\n\nAs one of the franchise's newcomers, Atwell, 41, tells PEOPLE she was especially touched by her costar's \"very thoughtful gifts.\"\n\nTIZIANA FABI/AFP via Getty\n\n\"I'm on my fourth Christmas cake,\" the English actress says. \"I've had a few birthdays as well because we've been working together nearly, what, over three and a half years now.\"\n\nFor one of her special days, she recalls receiving \"a beautiful amphora\" from Cruise, which she describes as \"this beautiful old clay pot, which is a natural filtering system.\"\n\n\"I'm like, 'It's a water jug. Nice,' \" she continues. \"And then you taste it and you compare it to normal filtered water or tap water, and it's really light and kind of creamy. It's just a different level of clarity. It's beautiful.\"\n\nParamount Pictures/Skydance\n\nKlementieff, who goes head-to-head with Cruise in Dead Reckoning as one of the film's villains, is also a fan of the coconut cake.\n\n\"I freeze it and then I eat it frozen, so I just eat it every day,\" she shares. \"That's what I did last year for Christmas. I started it when I got it and I ate it every morning, so I had a sugar rush. It was not good for my health, but it was delicious.\"\n\nAnother gift from Cruise was even more addictive.\n\n\"Another beautiful gift that was so thoughtful is that I wanted to skydive with him and also the stunt team, but they said that I needed to get my license,\" recalls the French actress, 37. \"So when I wrapped the movie, he gifted me, as my wrap gift, the lessons of learning how to skydive.\"\n\n\"He found a teacher for me and I learned how to skydive and I got my license and we even did jumps together. And now I'm addicted, so that's my new thing now!\"\n\nCourtesy of Paramount Pictures\n\nDespite having worked with Cruise since the third Mission: Impossible film in 2006, Pegg, 53, continues to be surprised with what his costar does for his cast.\n\n\"He's always very keen to show his appreciation,\" says Pegg. \"I think he's so used to being the focus of attention, it's naturally his instinct to kind of reflect everything back. And he's always incredibly sort of generous in terms of his gratitude to us and how he thanks us and how he lets us know that we're valued.\"\n\nNever miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nOne way Cruise showed his appreciation for his crew, as Pegg recalls, was taking the team shark-diving on a break from filming.\n\n\"We were filming somewhere near some coastal waters where there were sharks and we had the afternoon off and we all jumped,\" says Pegg.\n\n\"It's such a Tom Cruise thing. We've been filming in a helicopter and he flew us in the helicopter to this place where you could go into a cage and feed sharks. It was one of those days that we got to the end of the day and we were like, 'That was a real Tom Cruise kind of day.' \"\n\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is in theaters now.\n\n"

    "text": "Some of the cast members of Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One have revealed that they had their hearts in their mouths while Tom Cruise was performing one of the most dangerous stunts going.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\nCruise, who is well known for doing his own stunts whenever possible, decided that he wanted to drive a motorbike off a cliff and then parachute away, which \u2013 given his celebrity status \u2013 must have been a worry for everyone in the film.\n\nAdvert 10\n\nWhat\u2019s more, his fellow cast members will also have worried for their co-star.\n\nIt\u2019s a dangerous thing to do, it turns out.\n\nTalking to NME, Pom Klementieff and Vanessa Kirby explained how they felt when Cruise was undertaking the terrifying task.\n\nUnderstandably, it was a bit tense.\n\nAdvert 10\n\nTom Cruise chucked himself off the cliff six times. Credit: Paramount Pictures\n\n\u201cIt was mind-blowing,\u201d said Klementieff, who plays an assassin called Paris in the flick.\n\nKirby, who is returning to the franchise as Alana Mitsopolis, added: \u201cEveryone else was so nervous and fearful, and he wasn\u2019t. I just thought it should have been the other way round.\u201d\n\nHer co-star continued: \u201cWe stopped breathing when he was jumping.\n\nAdvert 10\n\n\u201cAnd then someone would yell, \u2018Canopy!\u2019 you know, when the parachute opens, and we would all cheer and applaud.\n\n\u201cAnd then he would do it again.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the problem with stuff like this \u2013 if you don\u2019t get it all on the first go, you\u2019ll just have to do it again.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\nAdvert 10\n\nThis sort of stuff doesn\u2019t seem to faze the 61-year-old Cruise, though.\n\nHe\u2019s been training super hard for the film, and he\u2019s been doing these films for decades now, too.\n\nIt has been reported that he performed more than 500 skydives and around 13,000 motocross bike jumps before finally going for a take.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of preparation, and very impressive dedication to he work.\n\nAdvert 10\n\nWhatever you might think about Cruise, he\u2019s committed to what he does, and he definitely doesn\u2019t do things by halves.\n\nThe blockbuster film was released on June 19 and is the seventh instalment in the Mission: Impossible franchise.\n\nThis takes some serious courage. Credit: Paramount Pictures\n\nHaving been delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, much like loads of other productions - not to mention just about everything else - the film has raked in around $226 million at the box office, and has broadly positive reviews.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 96 percent positive critical score, with an average rating of eight out of 10."

Photo / AP\n\nThe strike began after actors\u2019 demands for higher wages and protections against artificial intelligence were not met in negotiations.\n\nThe A-list cast of Christopher Nolan\u2019s epic Oppenheimer walked out of the movie\u2019s UK premiere in London and Ryan Reynolds\u2019 Deadpool 3 has also gone on hiatus.\n\nOppenheimer cast members including Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh were visibly emotional as they left the premiere early and Nolan said the cast had left to \u201cwrite their picket signs\u201d.\n\nSuccession star Brian Cox said the situation may cause Hollywood big hitters to \u201cgo to the brink\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a situation that can get really very unpleasant and could go on for some time,\u201d the actor told Sky News.\n\nThe bulk of filming for part two of Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning has already been shot, with only some of the most extreme, and crucial, scenes yet to be filmed.\n\nDirector Christopher McQuarrie told Collider at the premiere of part one: \u201cWe\u2019ve shot all but one of our international locations. We\u2019ve shot our big action except for the biggest set piece, the central set piece of the film, which is massive and unlike anything we\u2019ve done and, I think, unlike anything you\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s another blow for the franchise, which faced setbacks while trying to film the first instalment, which was constantly pushed back by the Covid pandemic.\n\nNow all of Hollywood is set to halt as unions ordered members to down tools during the long-standing row that could delay the release of blockbusters across the globe.\n\nThe latest Deadpool instalment, starring Ryan Reynolds, has also halted production. Photo / Supplied\n\nThe actors\u2019 strike centres on a dispute over compensation, especially in light of an industry-wide shift towards streaming that has changed the way performers receive residuals or royalty payments.\n\nProtections for actors from AI are also on the negotiation table due to advancements in technology causing fears within the industry.\n\n\n\n"

Fans and supporters of such celebrities make numerous efforts to meet them- some travel across the globe to catch a glimpse while others wait for them in hotel lobbies or outside restaurants for long hours. In one such instance, a woman recently got to meet her crush, Tom Cruise, at the premiere of 'Mission Impossible 7'. She shared a video on Instagram where she spoke to the actor and told him about the same. Hearing this, Mr Cruise had the funniest reply. His response is going viral on social media and the internet cannot get enough of it.\n\nThe video was shared by a user who goes by the handle @grace_trx on Instagram. In the video, she is seen greeting the actor. She then tells the actor that 30 years ago her mother told her father that she has a crush on Tom Cruise. Later, she tells him that it's not only her mom, but she has a crush on the actor too. Hearing this, Mr Cruise jokingly said, \"I hope your dad's ok with that.\"\n\n\"Had the sweetest moment with @tomcruise at his Mission Impossible 7 premiere on Monday. If you know me, you'll know how much this means to me because I've loved him as an actor and his movies since high school. The undivided attention to listen to my story, him reaching out to squeeze my hand gently - he made me feel like I was the only person there.He also came back to me to check that I took the perfect photo of us, after he had already moved on to other fans. Can't wait to see the movie,\" she wrote in the caption.\n\nSince being shared two weeks ago, her post has amassed over 2.8 million views and 4.7 lakh likes.\n\n\"Bro is a generational crush,\" said a user.\n\nAnother user commented, \"Tom's really been the villain for her dad.\"\n\n\"You deserve a lot of credit for getting that story out coherently in front of an absolute legend,\" remarked another user.\n\n\"I love how Tom took the time to listen, didn't rush you and was classy as always. That is why he is a movie star,\" commented a person.\n\nA fifth user added, \"How were you able to actually have a conversation with him? If I was in your shoes I'd have forgotten how to speak as soon as he came up to me.\"\n\n\"My Man Stole Both The Generations,\" added a user.\n\nClick for more trending news"

    "text": "Whether motorcycling off a cliff in Dead Reckoning, scaling the exterior of the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Ghost Protocol or dangling from a helicopter in Fallout, Tom Cruise is famous for doing his own stunts in his visually breathtaking Mission: Impossible films.\n\nHe's a Hollywood star who has always made clear that he believes that audiences would much rather see actors themselves rather than any computerised digital jiggery-pokery when it comes to performing action sequences.\n\nAnd it was his passion for authenticity that saw Cruise intervene last week in the dispute between actors and film producers over new artificial intelligence (AI) technology that, in theory, could mean he never has to do another stunt again and audiences would never know the difference.\n\nThe entertainment industry bible, The Hollywood Reporter, states that, in the run-up to the Hollywood actors and writers strike, the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) recruited him to help voice their fears over the use of AI by the studios and streaming giants.\n\nIt was his passion for authenticity that saw Cruise (pictured with Hayley Atwell) intervene last week in the dispute between actors and film producers over new artificial intelligence (AI) technology that, in theory, could mean he never has to do another stunt again and audiences would never know the difference\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter, states that, in the run-up to the Hollywood actors and writers strike, the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) recruited him to help voice their fears over the use of AI by the studios and streaming giants. Pictured: Olivia Wilde\n\nAI lies at the heart of the strike that has brought Hollywood to a standstill. Battles over pay and healthcare are certainly part of the dispute but the unions claim 'generative' AI actually poses an existential threat to film and TV as we know it.\n\nThey say it could be used by studios to replace actors and professional stuntmen and women by making it look as if the actors are performing when they are not. It could be used to bring long-dead stars 'back to life' to play roles in modern films. And, astonishingly, it's widely predicted that AI programs will one day be able to create digitally the entire cast for a film. All of it so much cheaper than using real people.\n\nFran Drescher, president of the 160,000-member SAG-AFTRA union, has bluntly warned: 'We are all going to be in jeopardy of being replaced by machines.'\n\nIs this all Tinseltown hyperbole? Experts say not. AI really could make huge numbers of screen actors obsolete \u2014 which explains why Tom Cruise is not the only celebrity involved in this fight.\n\nAmong many others are his co-star in Dead Reckoning, Hayley Atwell, and Succession star Brian Cox, who joined a demonstration in London last week by the British actors' union Equity.\n\nHollywood writers, who were the first to strike, also fear that AI will replace them \u2014 that digital entities could soon be delivering polished scripts created by computer. Popular AI programs such as ChatGPT don't seem able to produce a convincing film script \u2014 but experts say that will change.\n\nAnd in the meantime, the technology is churning out film plots and ideas, while some screenwriters complain that they are being offered insultingly cheap rates to clean up sub-par AI-created scripts rather than produce original ones themselves.\n\nBut if the threat to film writers seems obvious to anyone who has ever tinkered for five minutes with ChatGPT, industry experts say the AI revolution ultimately poses a far more serious menace to those who appear on the screen. And particularly to the massed ranks of actors whose names you will never recognise.\n\nThe principal issue surrounding AI for the unions is that it has potentially calamitous implications for the rank-and-file 'extras' (known in the U.S. as background actors) who constitute the vast majority of the profession in Hollywood. They are not famous and scratch out a living, working for modest day rates and never knowing one week to the next whether they will have work.\n\nThese are the people who have made up crowd scenes and even armies in epic productions \u2014 actors we have all taken for granted for decades. Their jobs are under threat as never before.\n\nFor AI can create and manipulate digital images of these actors so they can be replicated again and again in film after film.\n\nIn other words, you could be hired to appear in a crowd scene in a new adaptation of Pride And Prejudice only to reappear in the background in a Star Wars movie, a Game Of Thrones sequel and possibly \u2014 if you're sufficiently photogenic \u2014 in a new Barbie film.\n\nAI took 40 years off Harrison Ford for flashback scenes in the new Indiana Jones film, Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez joins the picket line as the SAG-AFTRA Actors Union Strike continues in front of Netflix on July 24\n\nThe Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) \u2014 which represents major film studios, big U.S. TV networks and streaming giants \u2014 claims it has offered the actors 'groundbreaking' guarantees on AI which will safeguard performers' digital images, and include a requirement for their consent 'for the creation and use of digital replicas or for digital alterations of a performance'.\n\nThe actors' union counters that these guarantees are worthless and that the Hollywood giants actually propose that extras should accept a day's pay in return for their pictures being taken and scanned by a studio. The latter would then be able to use that image in every film or programme they liked 'for the rest of eternity'.\n\nBut as Tom Cruise's involvement in the strike illustrates, it is not just jobbing actors who are affected. Top stars also feel threatened, even though, to date, some of AI's most obvious on-screen applications relating to them have been benign, such as knocking decades off the ages of Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci in the 2019 Martin Scorsese gangster film The Irishman.\n\nCritics complained that the technology used in The Irishman was far from perfect and the stars looked weird. However, AI continues to improve rapidly and the on-screen result becomes ever more convincing.\n\nIt took 40 years off Harrison Ford for flashback scenes in the new Indiana Jones film, Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny.\n\nFord, 81, said he was delighted with his digital facelift. 'That is my actual face at that age,' he explained on a U.S. chatshow. 'They have this artificial intelligence program. It can go through every foot of film that Lucasfilm owns because I did a bunch of movies for them and they have all this footage including film that wasn't printed \u2014 stock.\n\n'They could mine it from where the light is coming from, the expression. But that's my actual face. Then I put little dots on my face and I say the words and they make it. It's fantastic.'\n\nAI magic also gave Val Kilmer his voice back for the 2022 blockbuster Top Gun: Maverick after he developed throat cancer in his 50s, taking away his natural speaking voice.\n\nThe technology was used, too, to recreate the facial expressions of actor Josh Brolin on the ugly mug features of Marvel supervillain Thanos.\n\nDirectors are being encouraged by galloping AI developments to be ever more ambitious with it.\n\nThe forthcoming drama Here, due out next year and starring Tom Hanks and Robin Wright playing younger versions of themselves, uses a new AI program called Metaphysic Live to de-age and 'face-swap' the actors in real time as they perform rather than later in the post production stage.\n\nThe film's director, Robert Zemeckis, has boasted that the technology will allow the film to do things that were 'previously impossible'. All these actors mentioned above, however, gave their permission for the AI engineers to get to work on them.\n\nThis wasn't the case when Tom Cruise and Keanu Reeves were separately the unwitting subjects of cleverly made and highly convincing 'deepfake' videos which went viral on social media, and which were created by AI algorithms. Bruce Willis was also 'deepfaked' into Russian telecoms commercials. Reeves, who ironically battled against an AI world created by a malign super-computer in the Matrix films, described the deepfake experience as 'scary', and is worried about its effects in Hollywood.\n\nMembers of SAG-AFTRA and WGA go on strike at Netflix, Sunset Gower and Paramount Studios on July 21\n\nREAD MORE HERE: What films and TV shows will the Hollywood strike shut down? How British viewers' favourite programmes will be affected by actor walkout Advertisement\n\nHe has revealed that he has had a clause put in his contracts to prevent the digital manipulation of any of his performances. Insiders suspect that other stars have done the same.\n\nBefore he died in 2014, Robin Williams made a legal stipulation that his image couldn't be used in any future film for 25 years after his death.\n\nKeanu Reeves has also flagged up the enormous financial appeal that the technology has to employers \u2014 as well as its threat to actors, and how creativity will be sacrificed for profit.\n\n'The people who are paying you for your art would rather not pay you,' he said in an interview a few months ago.\n\n'They're actively seeking a way around you.'\n\nSusan Sarandon, star of Thelma & Louise and currently joining the Hollywood strikers' pickets, is another actor who has voiced concerns about AI, saying it could make her 'say and do things I have no choice about'.\n\nAnd there are other ethical issues over the use of AI to recreate actors who are dead.\n\nIn 2021, a documentary about the late chef and TV personality Anthony Bourdain came in for criticism when its makers re-created his voice but failed to say whether they had got his permission to do so before he unexpectedly died.\n\nDisney used AI to put Carrie Fisher, alias Princess Leia, in the 2019 Star Wars spinoff The Rise Of Skywalker even though she had died three years earlier.\n\nThe inclusion, adapted unused footage from an earlier film, reportedly had the blessing of her daughter, actress Billie Lourd, but who can be certain that Fisher herself would have agreed?\n\nAt least asking her permission was an option, which was never the case with The Andy Warhol Diaries, a 2022 Netflix TV series which recreated the voice of the artist who died in 1987.\n\nAmerica's National Association of Voice Actors has called for stronger AI regulation, saying it is becoming ever harder to detect when synthesised voices are replacing real ones.\n\nAI has very much exposed the moral issue of what rights individuals \u2014 including celebrities \u2014 have after they die.\n\nActors may dream of cinematic immortality but critics question whether the stars of Hollywood would be nearly so keen if it simply meant coming back as a digital clone. Film-makers are now on to their second attempt to resurrect James Dean, who died aged just 24 in a car accident in 1955 after starring in just three films.\n\nA 2019 feature film, Finding Jack, was cancelled but he has since been 'cast' in upcoming movie Back To Eden, a sci-fi film in which his walking, talking digital character will interact on screen with real actors on screen.\n\nAs Tom Hanks has pointed out, 'I could be hit by a bus tomorrow and that's it, but my performances can go on and on and on.'\n\nSome in Hollywood fear that all this AI-enabled nostalgia and virtual resurrections will also stop producers bothering to find new talent.\n\nOne only need look at this summer's blockbusters at the cinema and streaming \u2014 starring the likes of Ford, Cruise, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Denzel Washington and Pierce Brosnan \u2014 to see the continuing appeal of older stars.\n\nA recent poll of people of all ages found 19 of the top 20 movie stars people most want to see are over 40. How much more appealing would a 60-something actor be if he can be made to be 30-something again?\n\nAnd if at 61 Tom Cruise can still 'speed fly' \u2014 running headlong off a Lake District cliff wearing only a parachute for his latest film \u2014 what might we see him do in the future looking 21 again?"

    "text": "Does Tom Cruise ever worry \u2014 as you might on occasion \u2014 that maybe he shouldn\u2019t have eaten something past its sell-by date? Who could ever say or know? He\u2019s not a movie star you identify with or empathize with. You simply get out of his way.\n\nMission: Impossible\u2014Dead Reckoning Part One is another colossal but expertly engineered vehicle, like 2022\u2019s Top Gun: Maverick, that knows exactly how to deliver the maximum Tom Cruise experience. Two hours and 36 minutes long, Reckoning spends too much time on expository blather, but you can just tune that all out as you watch Cruise being put through his paces (and his paces are faster and better than yours) in two phenomenal action scenes.\n\nOne is a breathless, battering car chase through the streets of Rome (partly in a tiny yellow Fiat). The other, even better, involves a train barreling out of control while Cruise, holding onto a motorcycle for dear life, plunges down toward the rogue choo-choo from a high, high cliff. If you have vertigo, it's a potential barf-bag moment.\n\nCourtesy of Paramount Pictures\n\nAccording to production notes, Cruise rehearsed for this particular stunt by completing more than 500 skydives and 13,000 motocross jumps. That probably answers the question about whether he worries about sell-by dates.\n\nIn the course of Dead Reckoning, number 7 in the M:I franchise, Cruise\u2019s agent Ethan Hunt suffers some genuine sorrow \u2014 he all but clutches his heart after one key twist \u2014 and even loses his cool, but mostly he sizes up every situation with that same wily, cocky Tom Cruise look, as if he could outplay and outfox doomsday itself. Which, actually, is Ethan\u2019s assignment here: His new enemy is a near-omniscient AI program \u2014 nameless, faceless and (one hopes) odorless \u2014 that basically wants to hack the entire world. It\u2019s so colossal a threat, Dead Reckoning will spill over into a second installment in June 2024.\n\nHayley Atwell is the major new addition to the franchise. She plays Grace, a thief who keeps trying to steal a key \u2014 part of a key \u2014 that\u2019s crucial to stopping the AI nemesis. If you admired the gravity and intelligence that this British actress brought to the ABC Marvel series Agent Carter or to STARZ\u2019s adaptation of Howards End, you may be puzzled by her first, flirtatious scenes with Cruise: She\u2019s glossy and empty-eyed, with a faint smile on her lips. She looks as hollow-headed as a Team America puppet.\n\nHowever, she\u2019s giving precisely the one-to two-note performance that\u2019s required here \u2014 the same could be said for returning players Vanessa Kirby, arrogant and kittenish as Alanna (she occasionally crinkles her nose), and Rebecca Ferguson, noble and watchful as Ilisa. Anything more would distract from the bold, cold mechanisms of the action. Their performances all interlock and flow with the narrative seamlessly, unlike Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s more idiosyncratic performance in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.\n\nChristian Black/Paramount Pictures\n\nAs summer action blockbusters go, for that matter, Reckoning is certainly the more impressive of the two movies: Harrison Ford\u2019s return was like a gift from an old friend making a surprise visit out of the dusty past \u2014 if his gift had gotten a bit banged up from all that time in the saddle bag and the wrapping paper was torn, so be it. Cruise is more like some new form of man rocketing in from the future, combining a primal will to survive with a gleaming indestructibility. He\u2019s like the evolutionary union of Bear Grylls and Buzz Lightyear.\n\nIn the long run, neither of these films deserves to be as well-remembered (or taken as seriously) as the year\u2019s third ginormous action fantasy, John Wick: Chapter 4, a dreamlike quest for both redemption and death in which Keanu Reeves, his dank black hair framing his face like a broken-winged raven, serves as the tale\u2019s woeful knight. It\u2019s the martial-arts equivalent of The Lord of the Rings.\n\nAt the moment, though, Tom Cruise is running in a straight line down the middle of a long air-terminal rooftop, pumping his arms like a windup toy. No one will catch him. Only an idiot would try.\n\nIn theaters July 12, rated PG-13\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "Tom Cruise really wants you to go see Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. And Barbie. And Oppenheimer.\n\nDespite his own blockbuster opening in a few weeks (that would be Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning, Part One), Cruise is urging his fans to check out the summer movie competition.\n\n\u201cThis summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters,\u201d Cruise wrote on Instagram post (below) that showed him standing with his Dead Reckoning writer-director Christopher McQuarrie in front of posters for Indy 5. \u201cThese are just a few that we can\u2019t wait to see on the big screen.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongratulations, Harrison Ford, on 40 years of Indiana Jones and creating one of the most iconic characters in cinema history,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou have given us countless hours of joy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love a double feature, and it doesn\u2019t get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie.\u201d\n\nThe messaging suggests Cruise is once again hoping to save the summer box office \u2014 this time by bringing along a few other titles.\n\nLast year, the massive success of Top Gun: Maverick (which made $1.5 billion globally) was credited as \u201csaving Hollywood\u2019s ass\u201d by no less than Steven Spielberg himself.\n\nThis year, a few films have struggled to gain box office traction \u2014 such as The Flash and Elemental \u2014 though Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse successfully popped.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is facing headwinds with modest reviews, yet is tracking to open with a solid $60 million to $70 million over the June 30-July 2 weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, Dead Reckoning is headed toward a franchise-best $90 million opening for its extended weekend, which gets underway Wednesday, July 12.\n\nThere\u2019s no tracking yet for Barbie or Oppenheimer, which open head-to-head July 21, but both are considered highly anticipated \u2014 though, with respect to Cruise, would likely make for a rather odd back-to-back viewing experience.\n\nThe move follows a viral report from Puck that a \u201cpissed\u201d Cruise was had loudly complained to Paramount executives about the impact of Oppenheimer\u2019s IMAX deal. Cruise was reportedly upset that IMAX was going to boot Dead Reckoning from its large-format screens after just one week in order to make room for its prior commitment to run Oppenheimer \u2014 which was entirely shot in the IMAX format \u2013 for three weeks.\n\n\u2014 Pamela McClintock contributed to this report"

Perry\n\nGROWING UP, Greg Davis was a wild child. \u201cMy family used to say I was bad,\u201d says Davis, \u201cbut I say I had a lot of energy!\u201d With all that energy and long, curly hair down to his back that he later styled into dreads, he got the nickname \u201cTarzan\u201d from his family. It\u2019s since become his middle name in his credits as an actor in action films like Top Gun: Maverick and this summer\u2019s Mission: Impossible\u2014Dead Reckoning Part One.\n\nShooting back-to-back projects with Tom Cruise requires every ounce of that Tarzan energy, something Davis knew from the grueling prep for Maverick, during which he withstood up to eight g\u2019s of force and underwent intensive swim training. This time, a mere two weeks after he got the call for Mission: Impossible, Davis was on set\u2014the \u201cset\u201d being a mountaintop in Norway\u2014waiting to watch Cruise shoot a stunt involving a cliffside motorcycle BASE jump. \u201cTom flies over us hanging off the end of a helicopter, gets to the edge of the cliff, and just jumps off,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that was his warmup for the actual stunt!\u201d\n\nDavis\u2014who spent his youth dabbling in football, basketball, baseball, track, and tae kwon do\u2014found kindred spirits and mentors in Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie. They all share a similar can\u2019t-stop-won\u2019t-stop attitude. But Davis knows how to relax, too, like on a trip to Jamaica last summer. \u201cI\u2019m a pool guy,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I do enjoy swimming, now that I\u2019ve learned from Top Gun.\u201d\n\nAt a tucked away booth at the Heimat Fitness Concept Club in Los Angeles, where Davis had just wrapped a Men's Health photoshoot sporting the summer's most versatile shorts and shirts\u2014get the look below!\u2014he described his wild first day on set with Cruise for Mission: Impossible, how the movies pull their intense stunts together, and why he hopes we never see the unreleased footage of the now-iconic Maverick football beach scene.\n\nBar Stars: These Gucci vintage-inspired swim shorts are made of breathable, fast-drying nylon.

Andre L. Perry\n\nMen's Health: Your father is a boxer and so is one of your brothers, but you've taken up a lot of sports and types of exercise over the years. What's been your exercise of choice to get into Mission: Impossible shape?\n\nGreg Tarzan Davis: Boxing is currently is my exercise of choice. For Mission: Impossible, I did a lot of physical training that required me to learn different techniques, so I've taken up kickboxing on top of boxing. I mean, it's Mission: Impossible\u2014it's an action film to the biggest degree. We do all our own stunts because that's what you do with Tom Cruise, and there are sequences where my character shows a background in martial arts. Something I think is so cool about this film is that each character has their own specific fighting style or way of moving. Rebecca [Ferguson] has more more of fluid style of fighting, whereas I have more of a brute force style, and Tom has his own style, which we all saw in the amazing Mission: Impossible\u2014Fallout bathroom fight scene. So if you go back and watch all the Mission: Impossible movies, you'll see that each character has developed their own physicality.\n\nTom Cruise is known for going hard in his movies, whether it's for stunts or fight scenes or chase sequences. Did you feel a lot of pressure to keep up?\n\nThere's no pressure necessarily. But you're always thinking, What is he going to have me do next? But he's so good at preparing you for what you're about to take on. So I've never been scared because I've been so prepared. He sets up all these training regimens in order for you to be able to do what you need to do. My training consistent of martial arts, weapons training, skydiving, drifting, motorcycle riding, and flying planes. It was like a crash course of every wild thing you can do in an action movie.\n\nChilling Out: Thorsun\u2019s classic Americana swim shorts can dry in a Miami minute.

Andre L. Perry\n\nThis is your first Mission: Impossible movie. What was your first impression when you got on set?\n\nOkay, so, the stunts that we have in this movie are insane. The motorcycle stunt is insane. And to see it in person is really insane. I went to set every day, even when I wasn't working, because I was shadowing McQ. I want to learn from him and Tom. They've been great mentors, teaching me all the intricate details of how things work, whether it's on set or in the editing room.\n\nOn top of that, we're all always on set when there's a big stunt. So I remember on the very first day, we were in Norway, filming on top of a mountain cliff. I asked how we were going to get to set, and they said, \"Oh, a helicopter.\" So they send everybody to the top of the mountain by helicopter. It's me, Haley Atwell, Simon Pegg, Pom Klementieff, Shea Whigham. We get up to the top of this mountain, and everyone is setting up for Tom to do a BASE jump off the cliff. So I asked, \"Where's Tom?\" Then Tom flies over us hanging off the end of a helicopter, gets to the edge of the cliff, and just jumps off. And that was his warmup for the actual stunt!\n\nPool to Table: Not your dad\u2019s chino shorts: These Vuori unlined, stretchy, loose-fitting swim trunks can handle all day at the pool and moonlight as a dressier look in the evening.

Andre L. Perry\n\nWere there any sequences that you had to hype yourself up for?\n\nMy first day of shooting was actually to shoot my big stunt. I was like, \"Damn, so this is how you ease people into the world of Mission: Impossible?\" When you're shooting stunts at these great heights, there's something that kicks in, that happens in your mind: you just don't want to fall. So you have to fight the urge to hang on for dear life. You have to look cool! You have to look like this is something you do all the time. In one particular shot, I lost my shoe and it just fell out of sight. I thought, That could have been me! Goddamn! Then I had to shoot the rest of the scene without a shoe. There was nothing we could do. The cameraman just had to try to hide my bare foot. It was a weird shot. But I couldn't stop the whole production to go get my shoe. You keep going, you get something, and you see what they can do with it. It was the same kind of thing with Maverick. You're up there in a cockpit by yourself, and you have to get the shot. You want to use every second available to you.\n\nQuad Goals: These sporty lined swim shorts from Brooks Brothers are great for swimming, running, playing pickleball\u2014you name it. They\u2019re made with 10 percent spandex and have a roomy thigh fit so you can really move as you kick, stretch, or squat. The five-inch inseam also shows off your summer quads.

Perry\n\nTom and director McQ have made a lot of these movies over the years and developed their own approach to creating big action movie tentpoles. What was the process of creating a Mission: Impossible movie?\n\n\n\nSo I got my first actual, full script for Mission: Impossible two weeks before I wrapped the film. Izzy, the AD, came to my trailer and she said, \"Hey, I have a gift for you!\" And she handed me this big old printed script. But during most of the filming, you get pages throughout the process. When you're shooting scenes with dialogue and you get the script for those scenes the night before, you have to adjust quickly and you have to trust McQ and Tom. But they also have to trust us. I think it's incredible that they have so much faith in their actors to handle an unorthodox process, to be able to adapt, and to make the most of the freedom you get to help create your character and contribute. And I will say that Simon and Rebecca were also great at helping usher us in to the Mission way. We would go into a scene, we would do something, and McQ would say, \"That's really good. Do more of that.\" Then the next day, he would come to you and say, \"That thing you did yesterday, we were watching dailies, and we loved it and now we're doing this new thing with your character.\" And I'd seen this in Maverick too. My part was basically a background character, but I did one thing in one scene and they said, \"Okay, let's give him more.\" So I was able to understand the process going into Mission.\n\nSpeaking of Maverick, it would be journalistic malpractice not to ask you about the beach football scene. What was it like to shoot that and try to live up to the beach volleyball scene in the original Top Gun?\n\nThat was an intense time. We killed ourselves for that beach scene because we knew how important it was, and how many people love the iconic volleyball scene from the first Top Gun. So we starved and worked out three times a day. We were angry campers\u2014hangry campers.\n\nThen we found out two weeks after we shot the scene\u2014after everybody had just pigged out\u2014that we had to shoot the scene again. So then we had to go through an expedited version of preparations. It was terrible!\n\nGet the Look: ($68) by Fair Harbor; ($1,389) by Frost NYC. Andre L. Perry\n\nWell, the results speak for themselves: the scene was so popular that last Christmas, Paramount+ looped the scene into a three hour yule log-style video for the holidays. Is there any more footage that you're holding out on us?\n\nOh, there's a lot of the footage that we did not want to put out from the beach scene in Maverick\u2014out in fear of embarrassment!\n\nWhy was it so embarrassing?\n\nThere's just one shot of all of us, oiled up, shirtless, doing the most erotic dances on the tarmac before even going to the beach. We're not even on the beach yet! It started out with us all just working out, and someone started playing some music, so we all started getting into it. And suddenly there's this raunchy Magic Mike moment happening on the tarmac of a naval base. Someone still has the footage! But we were supposed to be these hotshot pilots, so I'm pretty sure the studio just couldn't put out a lot of the content that they recorded. And I am thankful for that!\n\nThis interview has been condensed for content and clarity."

    "text": "Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part 2 is still being filmed as we speak according to the movie's director. Christopher McQuarrie was interviewed by Collider's Steve Weintraub during the movie's worldwide premiere. As for Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part 2, a lot of the international locations are done. But, the biggest set piece at the heart of the movie is still left to hammer out. The creative team is already teasing the absolute scale of that one. McQuarrie also mentioned that there are some surprises waiting for fans in Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part 2. Characters that didn't appear in the first installment, action sequences for the whole team, and much more. Check out what he had to say here.\n\nMcQuarrie began, \"We've shot all but one of our international locations. We've shot our big action except for the biggest set piece, the central set piece of the film, which is massive and unlike anything we've done, and, I think, unlike anything you've seen.\"\n\n\"All the interstitial stuff is shot. There are characters in the movie you don't even know about yet. And I have one\u2014how would I call it? It's a sidebar action sequence involving the team, which we haven't shot yet, and that's first up as soon as we get back,\" he continued. \"It's involving elements that I've never worked with before. It's a big challenge, and it's a tight schedule. The plan to be wrapped for all principal photography is early next year.\"\n\nMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One Brings the Stunts\n\nIt's no secret that these big stunts have become the lifeblood of the Mission: Impossible brand. No one is driving that truck, or in this case motorcycle, harder than Tom Cruise. Comicbook.com's Brandon Davis spoke to McQuarrie about the hair-raising bike stunt in Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part 1. The push to keep going bigger is keeping the director very busy.\n\n\"There's not a chicken, there's not an egg,\" McQuarrie explained. \"Sometimes we start with...like, Fallout started with the emotional story of Ethan and Julia, and the stunts were kind of put around in the periphery. The beginning of this one, I said, 'What do you want to do?' He said, 'I want to ride a motorcycle off a cliff. What do you want to do?' And I said, 'I want to wreck a train. Let's just wreck a train.' Of course, both of us at one point or another would remind the other, 'You know, this was your idea. You wanted to do this.' Tom was very fortunate in one respect becuase he got his stunt out of the way day one. I'm still shooting that train. That just took forever, and it was very, very challenging.\"\n\nChristopher McQuarrie Knows The Weight of the Mission: Impossible Brand\n\n(Photo: Paramount Pictures)\n\nWorking in these big franchises can be a little tough. McQuarrie told Total Film that the realization came through very clear working on Top Gun: Maverick. It seems like people care about these long-established characters more than ever. So, the pressure is there, but the filmmaker feels like the team can meet that expectation.\n\n\"I don't take my position for granted. I don't take the audience's participation for granted. When we were making Top Gun: Maverick, I didn't take for granted that people loved that movie or that it was a 35-year-old cultural institution. I looked at it with a very suspicious and cynical eye towards Hollywood's tendency to make it a cash grab,\" McQuarrie said. \"So, everything I do is to constantly check myself and remind myself that it does not matter what you did before, this is the one you're doing now. I'm terrified of the result of Dead Reckoning, which lives in the shadow of Fallout, which lives in the shadow of Rogue [Nation], and Ghost [Protocol], and all the other movies that came before it. I don't want to let the franchise down. I'm more frightened now than I was on my first Mission.\"\n\nHow Do We Get To Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part Two?\n\nTom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, which premieres in theaters on July 12th. It's the beginning of the end for the action-packed franchise, as Cruise reteams with longtime collaborator and filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie for more death-defying and breathtaking stunts. Hunt and allies Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) attempt to track down a new weapon with the power to tear the world apart. Actors Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, and Esai Morales join the cast for the latest installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise, which is set to wrap up with Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part Two.\n\nAre you amped to see Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One?

    "text": "Mission: Impossible is getting ready to release another installment in the franchise, and it's actually the first part of a two-parter. Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One is already in theaters, and it was released to some of the best reactions of the year for a blockbuster movie. Not only is Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One one of the best-reviewed films of the year, it's actually the highest-rated Tom Cruise film of all time, and that's saying a lot for one of the last movie stars. The film seems to have it all going for it. Stunts, action, and a hell of a plot But one of the things it doesn't have is Angela Bassett. According to a new interview with Variety, director Christopher McQuarrie revealed what Bassett's role could have been in Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One and even teased her return in Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part Two.\n\n\"It was interesting,\" McQuarrie said in a recent interview with the trade. \"She was going to be the head of the CIA. She would have been in that room with all the other heads of the intelligence community and, uh, we're not done with Angela Bassett. Angela is too fabulous. You could never ever let Angela get away. There's always a plan in the future.\"\n\nWhat happens in Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One?\n\nTom Cruise is back as the iconic action hero Ethan Hunt in the seventh installment, Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, which is set to make its way into theaters next week. It's the beginning of the end for the action-packed franchise, as Cruise reteams with longtime collaborator and director Christopher McQuarrie for more death-defying and breathtaking stunts. Hunt and allies Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) attempt to track down a new weapon with the power to tear the world apart. Actors Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, and Esai Morales join the cast for the latest installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise, which is set to wrap up with Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part Two.\n\nMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One is set to roll into theaters on July 12th with a sequel, Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part Two, already filming and expected to hit theaters on June 28, 2024, but could wind up being delayed due to the ongoing WGA strike.

And it probably won\u2019t be the last time that he risks his life to achieve the best scenes for one of his favorite series: Mission Impossible. So much so that Paramount Pictures has shared a new making-of trailer in which we see good old Tom paragliding surrounded by cameras, thus achieving one of the riskiest and most spectacular sequences in the actor\u2019s already long career. This is how they filmed the so called \u201cSpeedflying\u201d scene for Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning - Part 1.\n\nTom Cruise and his riskiest scenes\n\nThus, after the famous motorcycle jump off a cliff, we now see how Tom Cruise stars in a new action scene executed by himself, without doubles, without cheating or tricks. So much so, that Cruise trained for hours and hours to learn how to paraglide down an impressive mountainside, including sharp turns at full speed to end up landing in the lowest part of the valley that served as the setting for this new feat.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to wait and see what context this new scene is situated in which the actor, instead of leaving these activities to the stuntmen, stars in the entire stunt himself, jumping from the top of a mountain without qualms. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning - Part 1 aims to become one of the most visually spectacular installments of the franchise, which is no small thing.\n\nFull screen Aston Martin's Canadian driver Lance Stroll competes in the qualifying session at the Red Bull race track in Spielberg, Austria on June 30, 2023, ahead of the Austrian Formula One Grand Prix.

    "text": "Tom Cruise has been one of the most recognizable stars in Hollywood for, literally, my entire life. The original Top Gun (1986) came out nearly 10 years before I was born (1995), so I\u2019ve never known a Hollywood landscape without Tom Cruise playing a major part in it. But somewhere in the 2010s it felt like Cruise had entered his \u201cjust a guy\u201d era. Movies like Jack Reacher, Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, and The Mummy all made technically decent money. But nothing that jumped off the page to say that Tom Cruise was a big box office draw anymore. Maybe after a couple decades of being a huge star, the big Cinematic Universe machine had finally passed him by. Or so we might have thought. Looking at it now, though, with the trio of Fallout, Top Gun: Maverick, and now Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part 1 in the past few years, Tom Cruise has proven that not only is he still, at age 61, a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood but he is THE force. Dead Reckoning Part 1 confirms what we\u2019ve known. Tom Cruise has no peers today as a movie star.\n\nMission Impossible Dead Reckoning Synopsis\n\nMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Recoking Part One Official Trailer\n\nIn Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team embark on their most dangerous mission yet: To track down a terrifying new weapon that threatens all of humanity before it falls into the wrong hands. With control of the future and the fate of the world at stake, and dark forces from Ethan\u2019s past closing in, a deadly race around the globe begins. Confronted by a mysterious, all-powerful enemy, Ethan is forced to consider that nothing can matter more than his mission \u2013 not even the lives of those he cares about most.\n\nUpping the Stakes\n\nAs the 7th film in the Mission: Impossible franchise, and following up the most successful film in the series to date, Dead Reckoning looks to heighten the stakes in every way for Tom Cruise\u2019s Ethan Hunt. Obviously the fate of the world being on the line isn\u2019t new territory for a movie like this. But Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part 1 weaves a thrilling, if a bit contrived, web of a story about a complicated AI weapon that feels especially timely given *waves hands vaguely* everything. While it\u2019d be easy for a story about world-eating artificial intelligence to feel completely detached from real human stakes, Dead Reckoning does a great job of giving viewers plenty of characters to latch onto.\n\nHayley Atwell hangs with Tom Cruise every step of the way in Dead Reckoning\n\nA Strong Supporting Cast\n\nThe stakes are a testament to the performances as well. You already know what Tom Cruise brings to the table. But beyond that, the supporting cast members, especially series newcomers and MCU-alumnae Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff, are all well-aware of what movie they\u2019re in and they provide the perfect amount of bad-ass sexy international criminal energy that a movie like this needs. Obviously no one is going to catch an Oscar nomination for their work here. But in order for a movie like Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning to work, there can be no weak links in the action or the dialogue that take away from how cool everything and everyone you\u2019re seeing on screen are. And I\u2019m happy to report that there are no weak links here.\n\nDead Reckoning\u2018s main villain Gabriel (Esai Morales) is equally off-putting, dangerous, and kinda hot. Gabriel is the scariest possible manifestation of the AI/Crypto bros we\u2019ve all come to despise on Twitter. He\u2019s a fanatic who follows the AI unflinchingly to the point it\u2019s become his God. And as annoying as that could have been, Morales makes it work by being fascinating to watch. Morales actually does what Rami Malek was trying to do in No Time To Die with the slow-talking heavy accent thing.\n\nEsai Morales plays a fantastic villain in Gabriel\n\nTom Cruise Stands Alone\n\nUltimately, as good as the supporting cast and the plot are, that\u2019s not why we\u2019re here. As the great philosopher of our time Nicole Kidman said, we come to this place for MAGIC. And for the past few years, no one in Hollywood has single-handedly provided us with more movie magic than Tom Cruise.\n\nSay whatever you want to about the Church of Scientology, or jumping on Oprah\u2019s couch, or whatever thing you might want to knock Tom Cruise for. But at the end of the day, who am I to deny this man who has consistently risked both life and limb, purely for my entertainment, his rightful due?\n\nMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One | The Biggest Stunt in Cinema History (Tom Cruise)\n\nWhether it\u2019s jumping out of an airplane, climbing the world\u2019s tallest building, or doing a motorcycle jump off a mountain, we know that Tom Cruise lives and breathes for this shit. I don\u2019t know why he does it. Maybe he has a death wish. Maybe he\u2019s had a mid-life crisis. Perhaps he\u2019s wanted to do all of this stuff forever and he\u2019s just now finding a way to make other people pay for it. I don\u2019t care why. What I do care about is that every second of Tom Cruise doing cool shit on screen, and there\u2019s a lot of that in Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part 1, feels authentic and spell-binding. At my screening, you could feel the entire theater shifting to the edge of their seats for stunts. You could hear the child-like glee and amazement of grown adults who just watched Tom Cruise do the craziest shit they\u2019d ever seen.\n\nThere are certain things in life that elicit a communal \u201cOHHHHHHHHHHH\u201d reaction. If you\u2019ve ever been in a packed gym for a basketball game where someone did something absolutely amazing, it feels like that. And getting to be a part of it in person feels incredible.\n\nThe crowd reaction is so good.\n\n\n\nNothing like a hot crowd for a basketball game. pic.twitter.com/Z2Z8yNlzAs \u2014 De\u2019Vion Hinton (@LordDexHinton) July 8, 2023\n\nI never thought I\u2019d feel that in a movie theater. But there\u2019s a stunt sequence in Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part 1 that got that reaction out of my crowd at the screening I went to. Through sheer force of will and movie star badassery, Tom Cruise had my Tuesday night movie screening sounding like a basketball game.\n\nYou can keep the Keanu Reeves of the world. Brad Pitt, Leo, Matt Damon, Christian Bale, whatever MCU star you want to name. It doesn\u2019t matter. Tom Cruise has no rivals and no equals as a movie star. He is a cinematic event unto himself. And we may never see anyone like him again.\n\nEnjoy him while you can. And do so on the biggest possible movie screen you can find. Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part 1 is yet another can\u2019t miss moment in an already incomprehensible legacy. It\u2019s one of them ones.\n\nGrade: A+\n\nRecommendation: IMAX, Dolby, RPX, whatever you got at your local cinema. Go to that shit.\n\nCheck out our other Pop Culture coverage here on the blog including our reviews of No Hard Feelings, Moon Garden, Beau is Afraid, and more.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @WatchWithApollo, Tik Tok @WatchWithApollo, and subscribe to our Youtube Channel Watch With Apollo for more.\n\nThanks for reading all that, and as always\n\n#SupportFlorencePugh"

    "text": "Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One may be a mouthful, but the newest addition to the 27-year-old movie franchise comes equipped with consistency and relentless energy. The two-hour and 43-minute extravaganza does not stop. Dead Reckoning is an all-out sprint (literally, this is a Tom Cruise picture, after all) to the finish line.\n\nAll the usual suspects are here. There are telephoto shots of Tom Cruise doing his best Usain Bolt impression. There are messages that self-destruct. There are our old Impossible Mission Force friends Luther Stickell and Benji Dunn, portrayed by Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg, respectively, whose familiarity allows Dead Reckoning to advance a complicated plot at a breakneck pace. With all that same, Dead Reckoning manages to be different. The film is a fresh, pulse-pounding entry into a flailing 2023 summer blockbuster season in dire need of the kind of escapism it provides.\n\nThe advertising blitz leading to the release of Dead Reckoning was vague about the film\u2019s plot details, but without giving away the story, the subject matter is prescient. The story\u2019s villain just a year ago may have seemed like that of a 2000s-era James Bond movie. In 2023, however, Dead Reckoning taps into the basest fears of viewers experiencing modern technological change. The narrative of the seventh Mission: Impossible film seems possible, if not probable, and while it can at times verge into silly, the actors play the scenarios so straight-faced that it\u2019s hard as a viewer not to treat them similarly.\n\nPom Klementieff in Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning \u2013 Part One from Paramount Pictures and Skydance.\n\nThe ladies of Dead Reckoning are the most valuable players in the film. Hayley Atwell, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, and Pom Klementieff all hit the ground running and provide compelling foils, allies, and everything in between for the IMF. Klementieff, in particular, shows a side unseen in her previous entries into the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Mantis. Her quirky, stone-cold killer is a welcome addition to the group of substantial actors.\n\nThen there\u2019s Tom Cruise, the superstar of Dead Reckoning. What can be said about Cruise that hasn\u2019t already been said? He certainly has his detractors, but it\u2019s challenging to find an argument against him being on the movie star Mount Rushmore. The man is here to entertain, and all of Dead Reckoning is a testament to that. Cruise runs, jumps, rides, quips, and emotes with the same conviction we\u2019ve come to expect from his recent offerings. There is no \u201cphone it in\u201d for Tom Cruise, and it results in a compelling and convincing performance that elevates the film to heights (literally) that other big-budget movies don\u2019t always reach.\n\nThere are nitpicks. The dialogue can be corny at times. The characters habitually look off into the distance and dramatically utter the movie\u2019s plot, seemingly directly to the audience at times. The main villain, and by proxy the story in general, while modern, is a little on the nose. Those taking this thrill ride should know that Dead Reckoning is part one of two, and expectations should be tempered to match that. Every loose end does not necessarily receive a tie-up here.\n\nThese gripes, however, are minor complaints about a film that doesn\u2019t take itself seriously enough to warrant them. The film is here to entertain, and it does, with exquisite style and substance. Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One is the movie of the summer so far and earns a recommendation."

    "text": "Tom Cruise has another potential franchise-best entry on his hands with Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One. According to the latest projections, the Paramount and Skydance movie could reach $90 million here in the United States on opening weekend. The three-day weekend estimate for Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One sits at $65 million. That would put the latest Ethan Hunt adventure ahead of Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout's $61 million opening back in 2018. That year and 2019 were absolutely banner years for the cinema on multiple fronts.\n\nMore interestingly, the success of Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One creates another dimension to Cruise's partnership with Paramount. As you all are probably aware, Top Gun: Maverick earned approximately infinite dollars at the box office. A lot of theater owners are pushing for Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One to be successful as well. Cruise was absolutely adamant about the importance of the theatric experience in the face of streaming a few years ago. So, that all hangs in the air as well.\n\nMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One Features Some Absolutely Harrowing Stunts\n\n(Photo: Paramount/Empire Magazine)\n\nComicBook.com's Brandon Davis talked to Hayley Atwell about working with Cruise. Her admiration for the star stems from his desire to make good with his co-stars. He goes out of his way to make them feel welcome. And that would include one particularly hairy stunt that most stars of his stature simply wouldn't sign up for!\n\n\"How did Tom Cruise manage to sit in the passenger seat first of all, handcuffed to someone else who was driving him, drifting him?\" Atwell said. \"That, to me, shows total dedication to his craft. [That's] probably the hardest thing he's ever done in Mission: Impossible. He was so generous, wanting to find moments for Grace that had real levity in the middle of the car chase sequence -- that had real comedy between them, that felt earned, that didn't feel pushed, or didn't feel like it was actually gonna take away from the stakes of it.\n\nShe added, \"Watching Tom and [Christopher McQuarrie] design this, this sequence and having me on a racetrack very early in the morning before the sun had come up with [stunt driver] Wade Eastwood in London, making sure that I was drifting competently and weaving in between cones, to make sure that I could obstacle courses, meant that by the time we got out to Rome, we knew what the shape of it was, and we knew that there was always gonna be time to ad lib.\"\n\nHow Does The Creative Team Decide on Stunts For These Movies?\n\n(Photo: Empire Magazine/Paramount Pictures)\n\nEvery big action movie now has numerous set-pieces. But, how does Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One go about choosing what makes the cut? Director Christopher McQuarrie talked to Comicbook.com about his choices with these films. He gave some insight on how they crack \"the stunt\" of any given movie in this franchise.\n\n\"There's not a chicken, there's not an egg,\" McQuarrie explained to Brandon Davis. \"Sometimes we start with...like, Fallout started with the emotional story of Ethan and Julia, and the stunts were kind of put around in the periphery. The beginning of this one, I said, 'What do you want to do?' He said, 'I want to ride a motorcycle off a cliff. What do you want to do?' And I said, 'I want to wreck a train. Let's just wreck a train.' Of course, both of us at one point or another would remind the other, 'You know, this was your idea. You wanted to do this.' Tom was very fortunate in one respect becuase he got his stunt out of the way day one. I'm still shooting that train. That just took forever, and it was very, very challenging.\"\n\nMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One Poised to Change The Game\n\nTom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, which premieres in theaters on July 12th. It's the beginning of the end for the action-packed franchise, as Cruise reteams with longtime collaborator and filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie for more death-defying and breathtaking stunts. Hunt and allies Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) attempt to track down a new weapon with the power to tear the world apart. Actors Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, and Esai Morales join the cast for the latest installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise, which is set to wrap up with Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part Two.\n\nAre you seeing Mission: Impossible when it releases?

Unless, that is, Tom Cruise chose to accept it.\n\nThe fearless actor has, once again, created such an incredible big screen blockbuster that audiences will simply have to pay for a ticket to see it.\n\n4 Tom Cruise's latest Mission Impossible is a blockbuster for the ages Credit: Alamy\n\nAfter the success of the superb Top Gun: Maverick, that finally got bums in cinema seats after lockdown, Cruise has hit the ground running \u2013 and jumping/flying/driving/train hopping \u2013 again with this action-packed ride.\n\nThe seventh \u2013 and without a doubt best \u2013 in the excellent MI franchise sees Ethan Hunt (Cruise) back with his Impossible Mission Force, including computer hackers Benji (Simon Pegg) and Ving (Luther Stickell), and martial art fighter Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson).\n\nThey are to embark on their most dangerous mission yet: finding a terrifying new weapon that threatens all of humanity if it falls into the wrong hands.\n\nSo far, so very Bond, right? In fact, the film starts deep below the Arctic sea, where a submarine full of sweaty Russians watch on a bleeping sonar as they are about to be attacked for a key that\u2019s on board.\n\nIt feels like any minute James will appear with a Martini and one-liner.\n\nBut, no.

    "text": "Movie: Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One\n\nYear: 2023\n\nDirector: Christopher McQuarrie\n\nRunning time: 2h 43m\n\nLast summer, Tom Cruise was given credit for saving the theatrical experience with the widely beloved \u201cTop Gun: Maverick.\u201d One of our last true movie stars returns over a year later as the blockbuster experience seems to be fading with high-budget Hollywood endeavors like \u201cThe Flash\u201d and \u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\u201d falling short of expectations. Can he be Hollywood\u2019s savior again? I hope so because \u201cMission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d is a ridiculously good time. Once again, director Christopher McQuarrie, Cruise, and their team have crafted a deceptively simple thriller, a film that bounces good, bad, and in-between characters off each other for 163 minutes (an admittedly audacious runtime for a film with \u201cPart One\u201d in the title that somehow doesn\u2019t feel long). Some of the overcooked dialogue about the importance of this particular mission gets repetitive, but then McQuarrie and his team will reveal some stunningly conceived action sequence that makes all the spy-speak tolerable. Hollywood is currently questioning the very state of its industry. Leave it to Ethan Hunt to accept the mission.\n\nWhile this series essentially rebooted in its fourth chapter, changing tone and style significantly, this seventh film very cleverly ties back to the 1996 Brian De Palma original more than any other, almost as if it\u2019s uniting the two halves of the franchise. It\u2019s not an origin story, but it does have the tenor of something like the excellent \u201cCasino Royale\u201d in how it unpacks the very purpose of a beloved character. \u201cDead Reckoning Part One\u201d is about Ethan Hunt reconciling how he got to this point in his life, and McQuarrie and co-writer Erik Jendresen narratively recall De Palma\u2019s film repeatedly. And with its sweaty, canted close-ups, Fraser Taggart\u2019s cinematography wants you to remember the first movie\u2014how Ethan Hunt became an agent and the price he\u2019s been paying from the beginning.\n\nIt\u2019s not just visual nods. \u201cDead Reckoning\u201d returns former IMF director Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny) to Ethan\u2019s life with a new mission. Kittridge informs Hunt that there\u2019s essentially a rogue AI in the world that superpowers are battling to control. The A.I. can be manipulated with a key split into two halves. One of those halves is about to be sold on the black market, and so Ethan and his team\u2014including returning characters Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg)\u2014have to not just intercept the key but discern its purpose. The key only matters if IMF can figure out where and how to use it.\n\nAfter a desert shoot-out that ushers Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) back into the series, the first major set piece in \u201cDead Reckoning Part One\u201d takes place in the Dubai airport, where Hunt discovers that there are other players in this espionage chess game, including a familiar face in Gabriel (Esai Morales), a morally corrupt mercenary who is one of the reasons that Hunt is an agent in the first place. Gabriel is a chaos agent, someone who not only wants to watch the world burn but also hopes the fire inflicts as much pain as possible. In many ways, Gabriel is the inverse of Ethan, whose weakness has been his empathy and personal connections\u2014Gabriel has none of those, and he\u2019s basically working for the A.I., trying to get the key so no one can control it.\n\nAt the airport, Ethan also crosses paths with a pickpocket named Grace (Hayley Atwell), who gets stuck in the middle of all of this world-changing insanity, along with a few agents trying to hunt down the rogue Ethan, who are played by a wonderfully exasperated Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis. A silent assassin, memorably sketched by Pom Klementieff, is also essential to a few action scenes. And Vanessa Kirby returns as the arms dealer White Widow, and, well, if the ensemble has a weakness, it\u2019s Kirby\u2019s kind of lost performance. She has never quite been able to convey \u201cpower player\u201d in these films as she should.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t matter because people aren\u2019t here for the White Widow\u2019s backstory. They want to see Tom Cruise run. The image most people associate with \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d is probably that of Mr. Cruise stretching those legs and swinging those arms. He does that more than once here, but it seems like the momentum of that image was the artistic force behind this entire film. \u201cDead Reckoning Part One\u201d prioritizes movement\u2014trains, cars, and Ethan\u2019s legs. It\u2019s an action film that\u2019s about speed and urgency, something that has been so lost in the era of CGI\u2019s diminished stakes. Runaway trains will always have more inherent visceral power than waves of animated bad guys, and McQuarrie knows how to use it sparingly to make an action film that both feels modern and old-fashioned at the same time. These films don\u2019t over-rely on CGI, ensuring that we know that it\u2019s really Mr. Cruise jumping off that motorcycle. When punches connect, bodies fly, and cars crash into each other\u2014we feel it instead of just passively observing it. The action here is so wonderfully choreographed that only \u201cJohn Wick: Chapter 4\u201d compares for the best in the genre this year.\n\nThere\u2019s also something fascinating thematically here about a movie star battling AI and questioning the purpose of his job. Blockbusters have been cautionary tech tales for generations, but think about the meta aspect of a spy movie in which the world could collapse if the espionage game is overtaken by a sentient computer that stars an actor who has been at the center of controversy regarding his own deepfakes. There\u2019s also a definite edge to the plotting here that plays into the actor\u2019s age in that Ethan is forced to answer questions about what matters to him regarding his very unusual work/life balance, a reflection of what a performer like Cruise must face as he reaches the end of an action movie rope that\u2019s been much longer than anyone could have even optimistically expected. Cruise may or may not intend that reading\u2014although I suspect he does\u2014but it adds another layer to the action.\n\nOf course, the most important thing is this: \u201cMission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d is just incredibly fun. It feels half its length and contains enough memorable action sequences for some entire franchises. Will Cruise save the blockbuster experience again? Maybe. And he might do it again next summer too.\n\nCulled from www.rogerebert.com\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nWhatsApp\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nTelegram\n\nMore\n\nMastodon\n\nEmail\n\nReddit\n\nPocket\n\n"

    "text": "\u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d topped domestic box office charts while falling short of initial expectations. Tom Cruise\u2018s latest blockbuster collected $56.2 million between Friday and Sunday, a lackluster start for a movie that cost nearly $300 million before marketing.\n\nHeading into the weekend, Paramount and Skydance\u2019s action-adventure was hoping to establish a new franchise record with $60 million or more. Instead, ticket sales landed behind 2018\u2019s \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout\u201d ($61 million) and 2000\u2019s \u201cMission: Impossible II\u201d ($57.8 million), which remain as the top openings in the 27-year-old series.\n\nComparisons aren\u2019t exact because \u201cDead Reckoning Part One\u201d opened on Wednesday rather than Friday. The seventh installment has generated an estimated $80 million in its first five days of release, which is more than \u201cFallout\u201d ($77.5 million) and \u201cMission: Impossible II\u201d ($78.8 million) earned in their first five days in theaters. With a stellar 96% on Rotten Tomatoes and a glowing \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore, though, \u201cDead Reckoning\u201d is likely to remain a force at the box office throughout the summer.\n\nBut right now, it\u2019s pulling in similar numbers to Disney\u2019s $300 million-budgeted \u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,\u201d which debuted to $60 million over the traditional weekend and pulled in $84 million through the five-day Fourth of July holiday frame. \u201cIndiana Jones 5,\u201d which doesn\u2019t have the benefit of great reviews or very positive audience scores, hasn\u2019t shown endurance; ticket sales stand at $136 million domestically and $302 million worldwide.\n\nTo avoid a similar fate, \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d needs to have a box office run as long and unwieldy as the film\u2019s title. The movie, which finds Cruise\u2019s teflon operative Ethan Hunt defying death as he flies off a mountain on his motorcycle, scales a runaway train and maneuvers a tiny car through the bustling streets of Rome, was incredibly expensive due to COVID-related starts and stops and other pandemic-era safety measures. So there\u2019s a chance that next summer\u2019s sequel, \u201cDead Reckoning Part Two,\u201d also directed and co-written by Christopher McQuarrie, will be less expensive.\n\nRepeat business, as well as global box office returns, will be key in saving Cruise\u2019s latest mission. Already, the seventh \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d is showing strength at the international box office with $155 million, even with its weak $25.4 million debut in China. That brings its worldwide tally to a respectable $235 million, the biggest global start for the franchise.\n\n\u201cThis [domestic] opening is roughly average for an action thriller at this point in its series,\u201d says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. \u201cThe foreign markets are where action movies excel and the overseas openings are strong.\u201d\n\n\u201cMission: Impossible\u201d films tend to attract an older audience, which doesn\u2019t always show up in force on opening weekend. With good word-of-mouth, ticket buyers could continue to find the film, as was the case with Cruise\u2019s enduring smash \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d which powered to $1.4 billion last summer.\n\nIn the past, \u201cMission\u201d installments have demonstrated remarkable box office longevity even with smaller opening weekends. \u201cFallout,\u201d for example, collected $61 million to start and ended up setting a series record with $791 million globally. Plus, \u201cMission\u201d movies tend to earn roughly 70% of overall ticket sales at the international box office. That should help offset any potential shortcomings in North America.\n\nThat\u2019s good news because Ethan Hunt is gearing up to face the phenomenon known as \u201cBarbenheimer.\u201d Next weekend, the latest \u201cMission\u201d will compete for attention against Christopher Nolan\u2019s dark historical drama \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and Greta Gerwig\u2019s hot pink romp \u201cBarbie,\u201d both of which open on July 21. The unlikely showdown between the two very different films has become an online craze, one that has carried into the real world with tens of thousands of moviegoers booking double features of \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and \u201cBarbie.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018MI7\u2019 could also benefit by being in the epicenter of that box office storm as a hugely appealing alternative to the other two films,\u201d says senior Comscore analyst Paul Dergarabedian. \u201c\u2018Cruisenheimer\u2019 anyone?\u201d\n\nElsewhere, the unlikely box office hit \u201cSound of Freedom\u201d climbed to second place in its sophomore outing with $25 million from 3,265 theaters, up 25% from last weekend. The faith-based movie about child sex trafficking has collected a remarkable $83 million after two weeks of release. It\u2019s a reminder in the power of religious audiences, who have turned out in force and look to propel the low-budget movie past $100 million.\n\nSony\u2019s horror sequel \u201cInsidious: The Red Door,\u201d which led the box office last weekend, dropped to No. 3 with $13 million from 3,188 venues. So far, the movie has collected a strong $58 million on its $16 million budget.\n\n\u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\u201d took fourth place in its third weekend of release, adding $12 million from 3,865 venues. To date, the Harrison Ford-led tentpole has grossed $145 million in North America and $302 million globally.\n\nDisney and Pixar\u2019s \u201cElemental\u201d rounded out the top five, generating $8.7 million from 3,235 theaters in its fifth weekend on the big screen. The animated family film, which cost $200 million, has managed to stick around with $125.3 million domestically and $311.7 million worldwide. But, like \u201cIndy 5,\u201d the massive production budget means it has ways to go to really climb out of the red in its theatrical run.\n\nIn limited release, Searchlight\u2019s mockumentary \u201cTheater Camp\u201d opened to $270,000 from six theaters in New York and Los Angeles \u2014 averaging a healthy $45,000 per location. The film, which stars Ben Platt and Molly Gordon as kooky drama instructors who attempt to keep their beloved summer camp in business, premiered at Sundance Film Festival to enthusiastic reviews. Moviegoers were also complimentary, awarding the film an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore. Next weekend, \u201cTheater Camp\u201d will continue its slow expansion to Austin, Chicago, Boston, Denver and San Francisco, among other cities."

    "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 After a globe-trotting publicity blitz by Syracuse-born star Tom Cruise, \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d launched with a franchise-best $80 million over five days, though it came in shy of industry expectations with a $56.2 million haul over the three-day weekend, according to studio estimates.\n\nThe Paramount Pictures debut was boosted by strong overseas sales of $155 million from 70 markets. But while a $235 million worldwide launch marked one of the best global openings of the year, \u201cDead Reckoning\u201d couldn\u2019t approach the high-speed velocity of last summer\u2019s top film, \u201cTop Gun: Maverick.\u201d\n\n\u201cDead Reckoning Part One,\u201d the seventh film in the 27-year-old series, had been forecast to better the franchise high of the previous installment, \u201cFallout,\u201d which opened with $61 million domestically in 2018. Instead, it also fell short of the $57.8 million \u201cMission: Impossible II\u201d debuted with in 2000.\n\nThat puts the film\u2019s opening-weekend tally very close to the tepid launch of Disney\u2019s \u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,\u201d which opened in U.S. and Canadian theaters with $82 million over five days and $60 million over the three-day weekend. Paramount and Skydance had higher hopes for the action extravaganza of \u201cDead Reckoning,\u201d which cost $290 million to make, not counting marketing expenses.\n\nThose costs were inflated, in part, by the pandemic. \u201cDead Reckoning,\u201d directed by Christopher McQuarrie, was among the first major productions shut down by COVID-19. It was preparing to shoot in Italy in March 2020. When the film got back on track, McQuarrie and Cruise helped lead the industry-wide recovery back to film sets \u2013 albeit with some well-publicized friction over protocols along the way.\n\nStill, \u201cDead Reckoning\u201d was hailed as a high point in the franchise. Critics (96% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and fans (an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore) alike came away awed by the stunts and chases of the latest \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d film. Though the coming competition of \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d \u2014 the much-anticipated debuts of \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d \u2014 looms, \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d should play well for weeks to come.\n\n\u201cThis is a global franchise. It\u2019s going gangbusters and its going to play for a long time. Quality always wins in the end,\u201d said Chris Aronson, distribution chief for Paramount.\n\n\u201cDead Reckoning,\u201d Aronson said, met or exceeded the studio\u2019s expectations.\n\n\u201cIn international markets, in like-for-like markets, we\u2019re 15% ahead of \u2018Fallout,\u2019 and that\u2019s taking China out,\u201d added Aronson. \u201cDomestically, we\u2019re over 3% ahead of \u2018Fallout\u2019 for the first five days. To beat its predecessor is phenomenal, especially in this environment.\u201d\n\nCruise, the so-called savior of movie theaters last year, traveled tirelessly to again pump life back into a summer box office that\u2019s been sluggish. After a splashy world premiere in Rome with a red-carpet on the Spanish Steps, Cruise and McQuarrie surprised theaters in Atlanta, Miami, Toronto and Washington D.C. in the days ahead of opening.\n\n\u201cDead Reckoning\u201d hit theaters at a crucial mid-summer period for Hollywood, and not just because of the SAG-AFTRA strike which began Thursday. \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d launched a week before one of the biggest box-office showdowns of the year.\n\nThough \u201cDead Reckoning\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d have vied for some of the same IMAX screens, each film has publicly endorsed the idea that a rising tide lifts all blockbusters. Cruise and McQuarrie in early July even bought opening-weekend tickets to both \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d \u201cBarbie\u201d director Greta Gerwig and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d filmmaker Christopher Nolan reciprocated with their own gestures of support.\n\nHowever that trio of films performs over the next few weeks will do a lot to determine the fate of the summer box office.\n\n\u201cThese are a crucial couple of weeks for the industry starting this weekend,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a fun reinvigoration of the box office because we have had a few films underperforming. Really, the summer movie season restarts this week with \u2018Mission\u2019 leading into \u2018Barbenheimer.\u2019\u201d\n\nNo other new wide release challenged \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d over the weekend. Second place went to Angel Studios\u2019 faith-based political thriller \u201cSound of Freedom\u201d which increased 37% in its second with $27 million. Jim Caveziel stars in the child trafficking drama.\n\nLast week\u2019s top film, \u201cInsidious: The Red Door \" slid to third with $13 million in its second weekend. \u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\u201d is dropping quickly with $12 million its third weekend, with a domestical total so far of $145.4 million.\n\nIn limited release, the Searchlight Pictures\u2019 mockumentary \u201cTheater Camp\u201d opened to $270,000 from six theaters in New York and Los Angeles.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.\n\n1. \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One,\u201d $56.2 million.\n\n2. \u201cSound of Freedom,\u201d $27 million.\n\n3. \u201cInsidious: The Red Door,\u201d $13 million.\n\n4. \u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,\u201d $12 million.\n\n5. \u201cElemental,\u201d $8.7 million.\n\n6. \u201cSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,\u201d $6.1 million.\n\n7. \u201cTransformers: Rise of the Beasts,\u201d $3.4 million.\n\n8. \u201cNo Hard Feelings,\u201d $3.3 million.\n\n9. \u201cJoy Ride,\u201d $2.6 million.\n\n10. \u201cThe Little Mermaid,\u201d $2.4 million."

Particularly, the train-set sequences drew comparisons between the two movies, leading to online discussions and contrasting opinions.\n\nTwitter users shared screenshots from both films, highlighting the resemblances they observed. Instances like Tom Cruise hanging off a cliff and the train crash scene triggered memories of Pathaan for fans. One user pointed out the irony, saying, \u201cFew days ago, I saw the whole Twitter making fun of #Pathaan train scene just because it accidentally has a similarity with Jackie Chan cartoon.

He was spotted with British actress Hayley Atwell - both wearing black masks because it was taking place in the middle of the Covid pandemic.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actor was photographed by a blue railway carriage - but the storyline, not surprisingly, was kept under wraps.\n\nOnlookers could see Cruise - dressed in dark trousers and roll-neck sweater - at work by a modified train and tracks.\n\nHe was flanked by an entourage as he made his way across the set and spotted clambering on top of a carriage while apparently filming a stunt.\n\nTom Cruise films on a train at Levisham for Mission: Impossible 7\n\nTrain action in Mission: Impossible 7 In one image, he was joined by Atwell, wearing a grey suit and white shirt.\n\nBut now that Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning, Part One, is out in cinemas, all can be revealed about what actually happened when Tom came to work for a time in North Yorkshire.\n\nWithout spoiling anything about the storyline, the North Yorkshire filming slots into the daring finale of the film, where Cruise's character Ethan Hunt has to board a train, which contains Atwell's character Grace and a combination of baddies out to do no good.\n\nThe world thrilling does not do the action sequences justice - be prepared to be on the edge of your seat, or grabbing a neighbouring arm as the drama unfolds.\n\nCruise not only filmed in North Yorkshire for the movie.\n\nScene from Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One out now\n\nHe was also spotted in the Lake District, filming daring paragliding scenes for the movie.\n\nOne lucky onlooker saw Cruise paragliding by cliffs at Buttermere - which turns out to be a breathtaking part of the final movie.\n\nTom Cruise paragliding near Buttermere\n\nWork on Paramount Pictures's Mission: Impossible 7 was hit by delays caused by the Covid pandemic, with filming in Italy in February 2020 brought to a halt as the situation worsened.\n\nAfter a delay, filming restarted at locations including Warner Bros Studios Leavesden in Hertfordshire.\n\nThe movie was expected to have been released last summer. The follow up, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning, Part Two, is scheduled for release next year.\n\nA last word: go see Mission: Impossible on the big screen - not just to spot Tom Cruise filming in our neck of the woods, but for a massive adrenaline rush while you do so!\n\nThe day we met Tom Cruise\n\nTOM Cruise made even more fans during his brief spell filming in North Yorkshire for Mission Impossible: 7.\n\nHe posed for photos with wellwishers and onlookers during filming of action scenes on a train at Levisham, near Pickering, back in April 2021.\n\nIt was during the pandemic, so masks were worn and social distancing observed.\n\nAmong locals lucky enough to see and meet Tom were Harriet Allen and her mum Amy, who saw him at Levisham.\n\nHarriet told The Press shortly after the meeting: \"My mum and I live in Pickering and a few months ago we heard a rumour that Tom Cruise had been spotted getting off a helicopter up the railway line.\n\nHarriet and her mum Amy meet Tom Cruise while he was filming in North Yorkshire for Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning\n\n\"We didn\u2019t think much of it till I did a bit of Googling and things started to happen on the railway - two carriages and a strange train appeared one weekend when we were out walking.\"\n\nHarriet said: \"Last weekend my parents spotted a huge marquee up on the old trout farm site and we heard the helicopters, so last night we went up to Levisham to see what was going on!\n\n\"We kept away from the crew and sat on the moor, watching the train speed off and followed by a helicopter filming it. But then the train came back about 20 mins later, and they all got off.\n\n\"We decided to cautiously wander to the station and we saw Tom say hello to the small bunch of onlookers on his way to his trailer. Then an assistant came out of his trailer to ask who were the ones having photos. We assumed it was all pre-arranged but they came to each bubble of people, handing out masks if any one needed and organising our photos before the star himself appeared, with trademark aviators!\n\n\"He was lovely and gracious, stopping for photos with everyone and commented on how much he liked Yorkshire. A really lovely guy - he didn\u2019t need to come and do this, we were quite taken aback.\""

    "text": "Did you know Tom Cruise's celebrated spy franchise Mission Impossible is based on Bruce Geller's 1966 TV series of the same name? Well, most spy thrillers are often a product of one's imagination, a representation of novels with heroic characters, or a rehash inspired by other spy dramas.\n\nWhile the Mission Impossible franchise could be based on a TV series, the dare-devilry action performed by the 61-year-old actor in these movies are a visual treat for all. And with Cruise performing his career's most dangerous stunt in Mission Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, the new installment has blown away the minds of the audience.\n\nHowever, Cruise isn't the only actor known for playing a fearless spy (Ethan Hunt) on the big screen. Many known actors like Matt Damon, Salman Khan, Scarlett Johansson and others have entertained the audience with their spy acts in edge-of-the-seat thrillers and parodies. Scroll down to check out these films and series.\n\nTom Cruise as Ethan Hunt in Mission Impossible & 7 other actors who've played iconic spy characters\n\n1. Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt in Mission Impossible franchise\n\nAfter scaling the tallest building in the world, strapping himself onto the outside of a flying plane and other mind-blowing stunts, Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt on the big screen. And this time, the 61-year-old actor is riding a motorcycle off a mountain cliff in Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One. The spy franchise that began in 1996 has emerged as one of the most successful and popular secret agent dramas globally.\n\nWhere to watch them: All Mission Impossible movies are available on Amazon Prime Video (except Mission Impossible 7, which was released in theatres on 12 July 2023)\n\n2.

    "text": "By Jana Monji\n\nFrench actress Pom Klementieff, 37, is best known as her Guardians of the Galaxy character, Mantis, but instead of the whimsically cheerful alien, she plays an assassin working against Ethan Hunt and his team in Mission: Impossible\u2013Dead Reckoning.\n\nEthan Hunt and his team accept the mission to find two interlocking keys. Hunt\u2019s old friend, former M16 agent, Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) holds one and Hunt must go into the Arabian Desert near the Yemen border to retrieve it.\n\nOn horseback, he\u2019s pursued by riders with guns for a sand-blown shootout. Faust is listed as dead but now Hunt must exchange the key for money. He hopes that the buyer will lead him to the other key and reveal what and where the keys can be used.\n\nThe exchange at the Midfield Terminal of the Abu Dhabi International Airport doesn\u2019t go well, and Hunt is forced to team up with a pickpocket who calls herself Grace (Hayley Atwell).\n\nHunt\u2019s team guides and helps him avoid other teams also in pursuit of the key by feeding into the surveillance system false images of Hunt on unsuspecting innocent bystanders.\n\nAnother team turns that game against Hunt. There\u2019s an invisible man, one hidden by the Entity behind one of the teams, but there\u2019s also a nuclear bomb in the baggage that one team member must defuse by answering riddles. Hunt\u2019s just distracted enough to let Grace escape.\n\nHunt follows Grace to Rome and it\u2019s there that Pom\u2019s assassin, the silent Paris, makes her appearance. She\u2019s a no-nonsense girl driving a big black SUV.\n\nKlementieff told Digital Spy \u201cI wanted to be something eerie and strange and kind of like a monster, but that looked like a porcelain doll or a pantomime at first. It was inspired by the character Pierrot from the Commedia Dell\u2019Arte. I wanted to bring something that was a bit melancholic but also a little wild that\u2019s unleashed when I do the car chase.\u201d\n\nThe audience soon learns that the ghost at the airport is a very real man, Gabriel (Esai Morales). Paris is also on his team.\n\nWhile Cruise\u2019s Hunt and Atwell\u2019s Grace share driving duties during a crazy and often humorous car chase in Rome, Klementieff\u2019s Paris seems to relish the chaos and destruction. While Hunt and Grace make it out of Rome they will be running to and from each other and ghosts in their computer systems in Venice.\n\nParis will face Hunt\u2013the first time in the franchise that Hunt will be fighting a woman, according to Digital Spy. That may be the reason why Hunt shows mercy, but the question must always be: Will this act of kindness hurt or help the mission?\n\nThat will be answered when a disguised Grace ends up on a train and Hunt is delayed from joining her while Gabriel and Paris are already on board. The title tells us that this fast-moving film will end with a cliffhanger and director Christopher McQuarrie gets you there with intense action scenes that while remaining serious have visual humor.\n\nMcQuarrie co-wrote the screenplay with Erik Jendresen (HBO miniseries Band of Brothers), but McQuarrie has been credited with the Mission Impossible screenplays since Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol in 2011 (with Josh Appelbaum and Andr\u00e9 Nemec). He also directed the 2015 Mission: Impossible \u2013 Rogue Nation and the 2018 Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout.\n\nAlthough, unlike the original series which seemed more of a team mission, the film series is a Tom Cruise-centric story, his character, Ethan Hunt has friends and enemies who return from previous films.\n\nThis film\u2019s Mission: Impossible Force includes computer technician (and Hunt\u2019s BFF) Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames and IMF technical field agent Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg). The black market arms dealer, Alanna Mitsopolis (Vanessa Kirby), AKA the \u201cWhite Widow\u201d is the daughter of a character from the first film and was last seen in the 2018 Fallout.\n\nKlementieff\u2019s Paris, like Kirby\u2019s Alanna, has a certain fashion flare. Working for a man who knew Ethan before he was Ethan, Paris is part of a mysterious menacing adversarial group whose client isn\u2019t initially revealed. Even when one knows more about that entity, there are so many questions still unanswered.\n\nWhile Klementieff may not have any lines, she is an important player during some of the action scenes, particularly the car chase. Klementieff\u2019s Paris will be back for Part Two when so many questions will be answered.\n\n\u201cMission: Impossible \u2013Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d premiered on the Spanish Steps in Rome on 19 June 2023. Paramount released the film in theaters on 12 July 2022. \u201cPart Two\u201d is scheduled to be released on 28 June 2024.\n\nAsAmNews is published by the non-profit, Asian American Media Inc.

In this episode, we feature our thoughts on Mission Impossible and Almost Paradise as well as some other shows and movies that have been keeping us busy over the summer.\n\nWe kick off the show with our review of Indiana Jones and The Dial of Destiny and then move on to the new season of Almost Paradise, which dropped last weekend on Amazon\u2019s Freevee channel. The show, which stars Christian Kane as retired DEA Agent Alex Walker is a rare blend of action and comedy and is somewhat of a throwback to TV shows that populated the networks throughout the 1980s and 90s. Jeff thinks this show is Christian Kane\u2019s best work to date. Whereas Ian loves the blend of action and comedy.\n\nNext up Marx talks about Silo now that he has viewed most of the show and expresses some concern as to where the show might go in its second season now that one of the key mysteries has been revealed.\n\nNext up Jeff gives us his thoughts on \u2060Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One\u2060 and enjoyed how the film uses A.I. as the main part of its story. He was particularly impressed with Hayley Atwell in her role as the thief Grace who gets in over her head with a certain group of IMF agents.\n\nWe round out the show by talking about Heels, which is a show about a group of professional wrestlers as they struggle to keep their franchise going. Heels stars Stephen Amell who is best known for his role of Oliver Queen in CW\u2019s Arrow.\n\nAnd finishing off. Jeff, Marx, and Ian give their thoughts on Star Trek: Strange New Worlds episodes Charades and Lost In Translation. So tune in. Zone out and have fun while we take you through a variety of TV shows with some really bad puns and awful jokes.\n\nYou can listen to this latest episode by pushing play on the Audio Player embedded below:\n\nIf you enjoyed our reviews show, please subscribe to our feeds and follow us on Spotify and iTunes"

Thankfully, Kartik Aaryan and Kiara Advani\u2019s SatyaPrem Ki Katha did the job of getting things back on track. Amid this, the Hollywood biggies continue to enjoy run of their own at the Indian box office, with first Fast X and now Mission: Impossible 7 turning out to be major successes. Keep reading to know more!\n\nIn a surprising trend, 2023 has witnessed no box office failure from Hollywood in India (major releases). Even though there have been limited films, none of them turned out to be a loss affair. On the other hand, there has been inconsistency with Bollywood releases. Thankfully, there are a couple of winners in quick succession, but on the whole, Hollywood releases have shown their dominance.\n\nIn 2023, except for Pathaan and The Kerala Story, there have been no big successes from Bollywood. Even Tu Jhooti Main Makkaar, despite closing its run near 150 crores, ended up being an average affair due to its cost. On the other hand, Fast X scored a century and was a huge success at the Indian box office. Now, even Mission: Impossible 7 is following the same route.\n\nMission: Impossible is now standing at 65 crores and will soon be overtaking SatyaPrem Ki Katha (75.75 crores) and Zara Hatke Zara Bachke (86 crores), which are celebrated as Bollywood\u2019s recent successes. It clearly shows Hollywood\u2019s dominance over Bollywood releases.\n\nStay tuned to Koimoi for more box office updates!\n\nNote: Box office numbers are based on estimates and various sources.

    "text": "Extending one of the most successful franchises in movie history, Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One follows secret agent Ethan Hunt on a quest to save the world from an AI program known as The Entity.\n\nTom Cruise is back as Hunt, accompanied by series regulars Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, and Vanessa Kirby. New to the franchise: supervillain Esai Morales and his deadly cohort Pom Klementieff.\n\nDead Reckoning unfolds on a massive scale, with scenes shot in Rome, Venice, Abu Dhabi, Tangier, Austria, and Norway, as well as various studios in the UK. COVID disrupted the project, complicating logistics for director Christopher McQuarrie and his production designer Gary Freeman.\n\nThis is the first Mission: Impossible credit for Freeman, who worked previously on films like Allied and Tomb Raider. He spoke with Below the Line by phone from England, where he is hard at work on Dead Reckoning Part Two.\n\nBelow the Line: Give us a sense of the scale of this project. When and where did your work start?\n\nGary Freeman: I started on this back in the autumn of 2019. They\u2019d already scouted several countries. I was concentrating on the Italian locations. Venice and Rome would be tentpole sequences for the movie. We were also in Ukraine. I believe President Zelensky reached out to Tom at some point, but the situation there obviously changed.\n\nTravel, distant locations \u2014 they\u2019re the heartbeat of these movies. We\u2019re in Venice in autumn, 2019, and it felt like everything was simmering. Veneto was kind of the epicenter of European COVID, but nobody really understood it yet. We decided to move to Rome, but COVID was spreading like wildfire. We were about to head out to Abu Dhabi when the whole world imploded.\n\nTom and Chris wanted to keep the momentum going, so we continued to work. I planned the desert build and the train sequences and had endless Zoom meetings with Chris McQuarrie.\n\nI think we were one of the first movies to have boots back on the ground when we restarted in Venice.\n\nBelow the Line: How important is it to do practical stunts instead of using visual effects? How does it affect your work as well?\n\nFreeman: It\u2019s all about the energy and the performance. We all know you can shoot in a CGI volume, and these artisans with amazing digital skills can pretty much do anything.\n\nBut with practical stunts you can see subtleties in performances. Take the Orient Express sequences. We shot that for real in Norway. We\u2019re not on a green screen stage, we\u2019re on real rolling stock going through an amazing countryside. The quality of light is different. You see light going through a cloud, you see the nuances of the performances. You\u2019re immersed in the action.\n\nTo help get that, we built rubber tops for the railroad carriages so Tom and Esai could get decent grips for their stunts. We built lower roof sections so we could travel on real tracks in a real environment. The visual effects team could work with real imagery rather than digitally generating backgrounds.\n\nBelow the Line: What about the interior scenes in the rail cars? What did it take to be able to move them the way you did?\n\nFreeman: That was all done on huge rigs. [Special effects supervisor] Neil Corbould and his team built these amazing rigs that could tip up and spin and drop. Huge gimbal rigs that were shot on the back lot. I can\u2019t remember how many we had because there were so many manifestations of the cars. Obviously, we had stage versions for the dialogue scenes. They were built as sets with flyable or wild walls. We placed them on gimbals that could rock and roll.\n\nThen for the stunt sequences we had metal versions, basically steel boxes that were built onto gimbal rigs depending on whether they had to tilt or drop. The special effects team built the armature or structure for the cars. We\u2019d tell them, \u201cWe need something sticking out here and something sticking out there.\u201d You would want all those items welded or securely fixed or boxed to the structure.\n\nWhen Tom and Hayley are dropping through the carriage and landing on those partitions between the sofas or couches? Those were structurally built and then clad in some sort of hard material, a GRP or hard foam, which we painted to look like wood.\n\nBelow the Line: What about that piano in the car? Was that an effect?\n\nFreeman: Oh no, that was a real piano that was dropped. Most movies would probably have done a CG version, but Chris wanted to drop a real piano. He wanted to see it drop away.\n\nBelow the Line: In the old days they would have used horizontal sets and just turned the cameras perpendicular to them, right?\n\nFreeman: Absolutely. But then on a flip side, we referred a lot to The Train, the John Frankenheimer film where Burt Lancaster did his own stunts. That\u2019s the film where they scuttled real trains. The power of that movie when you see real 70-, 80-, 100-ton steam locomotives smashing and crashing\u2014you almost feel the weight of them. Or Buster Keaton\u2019s The General. That\u2019s the way Tom and Chris roll, they want to acknowledge those classic movies where they did it for real. That\u2019s why the energy comes across. You as a viewer feel that it\u2019s real.\n\nIt makes my life a nightmare because it\u2019s so much easier to do it digitally on a green screen and have visual effects add texture. I don\u2019t think that ever works. It doesn\u2019t look as good.\n\nBelow the Line: What about the sequence in Rome where cars are crashing down the Spanish Steps? I noticed in the credits a \u201cdo not try this yourself\u201d disclaimer.\n\nFreeman: I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been to the Spanish Steps but they\u2019re vast. The idea was to send our version of a military special forces armored truck probably weighing about five tons down them. Chris wanted it to be this sort of Terminator-style unstoppable machine that would break through walls and crash down.\n\nChris is not a previs kind of person because he doesn\u2019t want to be boxed in, but that sequence was so specific that it was very heavily prevised. We always try to give Chris options to swing left or right, but we had to be a bit more surgical in that build. That was something we worked on during COVID. I had digital models we used to spin around, examine angles, to give Chris as much as we could within the parameters we had.\n\nWe split the sequence into three parts. Parts one and three we shot in Rome. So everything at the top of the stairs and everything at the bottom was all Rome.\n\nWe built the steps in between ourselves on the back lot. It was a hugely expensive build because of the detail and also the reinforcement for the armored truck. A lot of structural engineering to work out. We massaged it a bit, used smoke and mirrors to provide an overlap between the three pieces. Then visual effects came in and did their magic and just blended the worlds perfectly together.\n\nBelow the Line: Are you working on Part Two?\n\nFreeman: I am. I\u2019m at my desk going through the locations, trying to get a package together for our director. A lot on, but it\u2019s all good. It\u2019s all good.\n\nBelow the Line: Does Ethan Hunt save the world?\n\nFreeman: I can\u2019t say anything except that the next one\u2019s going to be even bigger.\n\nMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One is now playing in theaters."

    "text": "The latest film releases include \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One,\u201d \u201cFinal Cut,\u201d \u201cBlack Ice,\u201d and \u201cTheater Camp.\u201d KCRW gets reviews from William Bibbiani, film critic and co-host of the podcasts Canceled Too Soon and Critically Acclaimed; and Alison Willmore, film critic for New York Magazine and Vulture.\n\n\u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d\n\nThis is the seventh installment in the 27-year-old franchise starring Tom Cruise, now age 61, who\u2019s still doing his own stunts. Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Vanessa Kirby and Rebecca Ferguson also star as members of a secret U.S. spy team led by Cruise\u2019s Ethan Hunt. This time, they\u2019re fighting artificial intelligence.\n\nBibbiani: \u201cThe plot is just an excuse to travel the world and do car chases and jump onto moving trains. \u2026 There's nothing particularly wrong with that. Despite being very entertaining by being very globetrotting, despite having fantastic action sequences, we've reached the point where these movies no longer actually feel like \u2018Mission Impossible.\u2019 This is just \u2018James Bond.\u2019 But whereas the modern \u2018James Bond\u2019 movies are super depressing and want you to really think about how much it would stink to be James Bond, the \u2018Mission Impossible\u2019 movies are like: What if \u2018James Bond\u2019 \u2014 but fun?\u201d\n\nWillmore: \u201cIn \u2018Top Gun: Maverick,\u2019 Tom Cruise was showing off against the drone plane, right? He was making the case that you still need human pilots, by which he was basically saying, \u2018You still need movie stars like me.\u2019 And in this case, he's facing down AI. So he's really making a point in terms of fighting on behalf of analog movies.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinal Cut\u201d\n\nThis French zombie horror/comedy is a remake of the 2017 Japanese cult hit \u201cOne Cut of the Dead.\u201d\n\nWillmore: \u201cThe movie is essentially them showing you how this disparate group of actors and crew members come together \u2026 to make the movie that you've already watched. \u2026 This film becomes a little bit more about the idea of authenticity and making quality work, even if it's not highbrow. And I don't think that works quite as well. I would say if you can find the Japanese film, it is the one to watch.\u201d\n\nBibbiani: \u201cThe remake is too slick. And I think it is weirdly apologetic about the kind of movie that the characters are making. When you watch the zombie movie that they're making, it is way more-in-your-face about how inept it is, whereas in the original \u2018One Cut of the Dead,\u2019 it's actually fun and freewheeling and it feels more real. Here, the film is slightly apologetic about itself, and I really think that undermines the wholesome, everything-is-wonderful-about-filmmaking kind of vibe it\u2019s trying to create. If you only ever see the remake, it will probably be fine and be okay. But \u2018One Cut of the Dead\u2019 is literally on Shudder right now and you don't have to pay extra for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlack Ice\u201d\n\nThis documentary exposes racism \u2013 past and present \u2013 in Canadian and American hockey. Executive produced by Drake and LeBron James, the film won the People's Choice Award for Documentaries when it premiered last year at the Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nBibbiani: \u201cIt focuses on the current aspects of the industry where, sadly, there aren't a lot of players of color, and the ones that are playing professional hockey are often denied meaningful opportunities. They're treated with outright racism, not just by fans, but also by their coaches, other teams. But there's also another aspect of it where they \u2026 discover a history of a Black hockey team from over 100 years ago, who were directly responsible for helping the sport evolve into its current form. \u2026 To see just how important that is and how swept under the rug it was, is both illuminating and, obviously, incredibly shameful.\u201d\n\nWillmore: \u201cThe film is a sidelong look at race in Canada. \u2026 One of the interviewees, who's an academic, talks about how because Canada was set up as the end of the Underground Railroad \u2026 the place where you would go to get away from America and racism and anti-Blackness \u2014 that Canada has historically been bad at talking about racism within it because it doesn't fit with the Canadian national story and identity. And there's a lot of denial or looking away, and I felt like that \u2026 was so interesting that I almost wanted more to be explored on that.\u201d\n\n\u201cTheater Camp\u201d\n\nThis largely improvised mockumentary stars Ben Platt and Molly Gordon. It revolves around a sleepaway camp in upstate New York and is based on an 18-minute short film that Gordon, Platt, Noah Galvin, and Nick Lieberman uploaded to YouTube a month or so into the COVID pandemic.\n\nWillmore: \u201cIt is really a celebration of the idea of theater camp as the sanctuary and haven for all of these young kids. \u2026 Most of the male attendees seem to be gay. Most of the girls are \u2026 big personalities. And it just is so affectionate about those kids and about the adults, most of whom are \u2026 former attendees \u2026 and are now eccentric teachers.\n\n\u2026 And I think at a moment where we're seeing actors and writers fighting back against large corporations, the underlying story about the scrappy theater camp trying to fight off acquisition from a banker \u2026 that has extra resonance.\u201d\n\nBibbiani: \u201cIf this is the soothing balm you're looking for right now, this late 90s, Sundance comedy kind of thing, like \u2018Wet Hot American Summer\u2019 but not quite as funny, \u2018Waiting for Guffman\u2019 but not quite as mean spirited, this will do you right.\u201d"

    "text": "The Mission: Impossible franchise has always found new ways to surprise us when it comes to the practical stunts Tom Cruise will perform, but the announcement of the most recent project also surprised fans when it was announced that the next Mission: Impossible story would be divided in half, requiring two movies to complete. While one has to assume that the studio had little problem greenlighting even more Mission: Impossible, director Christopher McQuarrie says it was the story, not the box office that required Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning to be two movies.\n\nMission: Impossible movies have always been showcases for incredible action. But especially in the time that Christopher McQuarrie has been at the helm, they certainly haven\u2019t skimped on the story either. And because Ethan Hunt works with a team, these are movies with a lot of characters. Speaking with Collider, McQuarrie says that it was ultimately the characters that drove the idea of breaking Dead Reckoning in two because he simply needed more time to create the characters and give them emotional stories. He explained\u2026\n\nWell, we knew with Fallout. Fallout really grew because of all the character and emotion we were putting into the story, all the things that we had discovered in Rogue Nation that was so unexpected. I knew I wanted to expand the cast, and I knew I wanted to give each one of those characters more to do, so I knew the movie was going to be bigger and longer than Fallout. And at which point I said, 'Why are we fighting this? Why are we going to try to jam this into two hours? Let's just break it in half and make it two movies.' That really was the rationale behind it being a two-part movie. It just it wasn't just that the story was bigger but that we wanted more emotion in the movie.\n\nThere certainly are a lot of characters in the Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One cast. In addition to Tom Cruise and his regular team (including Simon Pegg and Ving Raimes), we see the return of characters we haven\u2019t seen since the first entry in the franchise, as well as several new characters who clearly have stories to tell. One can only imagine how difficult it would be to give all of them enough to do, in a way that would be emotionally satisfying, if they tried to cram it all into a single film.\n\nDead Reckoning Part One is already a nearly three-hour movie, so a plot that moved twice as fast would have so much story to cover that it\u2019s hard to imagine we\u2019d get to know the characters at all. McQuarrie has said that he specifically wanted to the new movies to have less plot in them because that let the action tell more of the story, and clearly, it also gave us more time with the various characters.\n\nWhat will happen to our heroes in Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part Two is anybody's guess right now. However, with so much groundwork already done to introduce characters and plot ideas, one can imagine it will hit the ground running, and with another two or three hours of story to tell, it certainly will have the ability to come to a very emotionally satisfying conclusion."

    "text": "Mission: Impossible star Henry Czerny has shed some light on his nearly three-decade long absence from the franchise.\n\nThe Canadian actor, 64, played IMF boss Eugene Kittridge in the original Mission: Impossible film in 1996, but did not appear again until Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, which was released in cinemas this week.\n\nSpeaking to Uproxx, Czerny, who is also known for his role in the spy thriller Clear and Present Danger, revealed that he had once been involved in a dispute over his character.\n\nAhead of filming Mission: Impossible, he took it upon himself to research the role, spending a day and a half with people at the CIA.\n\n\u201cBecause they want people to know what they do as well, within reason, of course,\u201d Czerny said. \u201cSo, I did all kinds of homework there. And then I had the script with me, and I didn\u2019t try to show them the script, but I knew the questions that I wanted to ask them about it.\n\n\u201cAnd so I went to the UK with all these answers \u2013 all these suggestions about what should be done perhaps with this script. And, of course, that was not met in the way I expected it to be met. It was, \u2018Thank you very much, but please keep that to yourself. Great backstory for you. I love that you did that for you.\u2019 Very Mission: Impossible.\u201d\n\nThe actor explained that he was \u201ca bit s***-grinned\u201d over their response because he had \u201cgone through the effort\u201d.\n\nHe continued: \u201cSo, after Mission: Impossible, the first month, I had a lunch with Paula Wagner, who was, at that time, Tom [Cruise]\u2019s producing partner. And I let her know all the things they didn\u2019t do with Kittridge, and what they should be doing with Kittridge in the future, if they had options.\n\nHenry Czerny as Kittridge in \u2018Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\u2019 (Paramount)\n\n\u201cAnd she was very polite, very nice, paid for the lunch. And that\u2019s the last I saw of Mission: Impossible. I burned that bridge.\u201d\n\nCzerny added that they may have been planning to write out his character anyway. \u201cBut I certainly didn\u2019t do myself any favours as a young actor telling Paula Wagner what she missed in this supporting character,\u201d he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe actor also claims that Christopher McQuarrie, Dead Reckoning\u2019s director, had wanted to bring back Kittridge in an earlier instalment, \u201cbut it just wasn\u2019t right apparently, or whatever\u201d.\n\nHe claimed that McQuarrie was \u201cmore open\u201d to his own input on the character.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s more open to what the actor wants to bring, given the genre, given the tone of the scene, given the trajectory of the story. Yes. All within that, thank you very much. But bring it and we\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nDead Reckoning is out in cinemas now."

    "text": "Last summer, when \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d was making roughly all the money printed in the United States during that fiscal quarter, I read a number of articles (many publications jumped on the trend at once) calling Tom Cruise various iterations of \u201cThe Last Movie Star.\u201d The moniker is obviously an exaggeration \u2013 Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt haven\u2019t exactly been left in the dust in Hollywood \u2013 but it\u2019s understandable where it comes from. It may take a few beats to remember that the \u201cAvatar\u201d movies star Sam Worthington or that Tom Holland is the most recent (live-action) version of Spider-Man, but there is no such confusion with a Tom Cruise movie. I bet most people, when discussing the \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d movies, say \u201cTom Cruise\u201d instead of his character\u2019s name, Ethan Hunt. For that matter, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if people say \u201cTom Cruise\u201d instead of \u201cJerry Maguire\u201d when discussing the film named after the character.\n\nAll of this is to say that Tom Cruise has an undeniable screen presence and charisma. He certainly has the straight-up talent to justify this popularity, but his blockbuster appeal is about more than that. He clearly believes that if he\u2019s going to be at the top of the industry, he should push himself harder than the rest of the industry. That\u2019s why he insists on undertaking difficult tasks like long sequences of running and dangerous stunts involving planes and motorcycles. This kind of dedication is why \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d is a respectable franchise unto itself and not the James Bond knockoff that it would be otherwise.\n\nThe new installment sees Hunt racing around the globe to stop The Entity, a computer program that has seemingly become sentient and bent on world domination. Whoever can access The Entity first, whether it\u2019s a government or an individual, can basically control the world. Hunt is initially sanctioned by the U.S. government, represented by Impossible Mission Force leader Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny), but he soon realizes that nobody should be allowed to have that much power, so he goes on a rogue mission to destroy The Entity.\n\nHunt is aided by faithful teammates Luther (Ving Rhames), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson). Complicating matters are money-driven duplicitous characters like high-class pickpocket Grace (Hayley Atwell) and black-market arms dealer Alanna (Vanessa Kirby). Full-on villains include assassin Gabriel (Esai Morales) and his henchwoman Paris (Pom Klementieff, gleefully maniacal in a role that frankly doesn\u2019t call for it), who are apparently representing The Entity itself, and no, I\u2019m not sure how that business relationship works.\n\nThe mission involves gaining possession of two halves of a key and then figuring out what exactly the key opens. It also involves an elaborate series of druggings, pickpocketings, thievery, bomb scares, knife fights, shootouts, car chases, crosses and double-crosses, and a ton of antics with a runaway train. Oh, and those super-realistic masks that this series loves come into play. This movie really hopes you like Vanessa Kirby, because you\u2019re getting a double dose of her here (no complaints from me).\n\nI spent most of this movie having a hard time deciding if it was worth recommending. Cruise and his team are their usual delightful selves, but it seems like this movie\u2019s been done several times before. The villains are more memorable than some of the others in this series, but their motivations are questionable. The action is mostly pretty exciting, but the stakes are affected by the \u201cPart One\u201d in the film\u2019s title, which tells me that nothing too conclusive is going to happen here. At the last minute, the film pulled out an effective action sequence with a train that finally earned it my endorsement. I reckon you\u2019ll have a good time with the seventh \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d\n\nGrade: B-\n\n\u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action, some language, and suggestive material. Its running time is 163 minutes.\n\nContact Bob Garver at rrg251@nyu.edu.\n\nfiled under:"

Preferably in IMAX because in a week\u2019s time, you won\u2019t be able to.\n\nWhy? Well, you can blame it on the release of Christopher Nolan\u2019s highly anticipated Oppenheimer.\n\nBoth movies release in mid-July with Mission: Impossible releasing on 13 July and Oppenheimer on 20 July. So when the latter drops into theatres, it will take up all IMAX screens in the US for three weeks, leaving Cruise\u2019s spy-action franchise with only a week in IMAX after opening.\n\nCruise was understandably unhappy (via Puck News) about the news but IMAX CEO Rich Gelfond has stepped forward with a solution that he thinks will appease the A-lister. Speaking with Variety, Gelfond suggests bringing back Mission: Impossible to IMAX once Oppenheimer finishes its run.\n\n\u201cI feel sad in a way we can\u2019t accommodate all of them. I know Mission: Impossible is going to be a really big movie,\u201d said Gelfond.\n\n\u201cNolan has a special place in IMAX\u2019s heart because he uses our cameras and promotes us. It\u2019s not a matter of us saying which we can make more money on. I would hope after Oppenheimer\u2019s\u2019 run, we can bring back Mission.\u201d\n\nThat said, there\u2019s still no confirmation from either party on whether the movie will return to IMAX so the best thing for fans to do is to rush to theatres when they can. Doesn\u2019t seem like that much of an impossible mission anyways."

    "text": "MI goes AI in this seventh outing for the TV-series-turned-action-cinema-franchise, a genuinely breathtaking romp that tops the previous Christopher McQuarrie-directed episodes (2015\u2019s Rogue Nation, 2018\u2019s Fallout) for sheer nailbiting spectacle and pulse-racing tension. The zeitgeisty plot may have holes through which you could drive the Orient Express, but for pure adrenaline rush entertainment this will leave you exhilarated and eager for more.\n\nThree decades ago, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) sold his soul to the IMF (\u201cno, the other IMF \u2013 the Impossible Mission Force\u201d), a covert organisation whose oath demands that its members \u201clive and die in the shadows for those we hold close and those we never meet\u201d. Since then, Hunt has saved the world more than once (his last mission involved neutralising nuclear bombs). But now he\u2019s up against everyone\u2019s favourite enemy de nos jours \u2013 a fiendish artificial intelligence known as \u201cthe Entity\u201d, a name that will sound sillier every time it is spoken out loud (and it is spoken out loud a lot).\n\nIt\u2019s hardly a new idea. Jack Paglen\u2019s script for 2014\u2019s 70s-influenced Transcendence dramatised the \u201csingularity\u201d (the point at which technology out-thinks humankind) a decade ago, paving the way for MI7\u2019s sentient viral intelligence (\u201cthis thing has a mind of its own?!\u201d), which is \u201ceverywhere and nowhere\u2026 godless, stateless, amoral\u201d, controlling and manipulating information so that \u201ctruth as we know it is in peril\u201d.\n\nThe wise-cracking interaction between Cruise and Atwell has a nice, old-school screwball flavour\n\nSomehow, this very modern threat has a very old-fashioned key \u2013 a weird, crucifix-shaped dongle that (like Archimedes\u2019s Antikythera in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny) has been split into two pieces that must be reunited to unlock its secrets. \u201cYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to bring us the key,\u201d declares the familiar self-destructing tape, the IMF having apparently shunned new-fangled voicemail or encrypted WhatsApp messages. Later, they will retreat to the safety of an offline analogue room \u2013 the one place the Entity can\u2019t get to them.\n\nWarring forces wish to own the Entity, to control and weaponise it. Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) apparently holds part of the puzzle \u2013 which puts a price on her head, because \u201cthe fate of the world depends on finding whatever it unlocks\u201d \u2013 thus sending Hunt off in globetrotting pursuit. The pre-credits sequence alone takes us from a submarine in the Bering Strait to a horseback chase through the desert, en route to a sandstorm shootout with brief stopovers in Amsterdam and elsewhere. We also get an early reminder that we\u2019re back in a world in which rubbery masks are realistic enough to get Jason Statham believing in the Face/Off machine again.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of caperish comedy afoot, particularly after Hunt teams up with Hayley Atwell\u2019s light-fingered Grace. A handcuffed car-chase featuring a Fiat 500 careening down Rome\u2019s Spanish Steps recalls the Mini-fuelled fun of The Italian Job (with a cheeky nod towards Battleship Potemkin), while the wisecracking interaction between Cruise and Atwell has a nice, old-school screwball flavour.\n\n\u2018Old-school\u2019: Hayley Atwell and Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One. Alamy\n\nElsewhere, the join-the-dots plot includes a James Bond-style mission to a lavish party where a scene-stealingly cracked Vanessa Kirby warns that \u201ctruth is vanishing \u2013 war is coming\u201d, a prologue to a Don\u2019t Look Now-style chase through the alleyways of Venice. Esai Morales, who proved so chilling in Ozark, nails another villainous role as Gabriel, a \u201cdark messiah\u201d who is \u201cthe Entity\u2019s chosen messenger\u201d. As for Cruise, he may still have the physical fitness of a less-than-40-year-old, but he\u2019s also developed a Richard Gere-style blinky squint of late, which adds a touch of melancholy maturity to his otherwise boyish charm.\n\nThe action is impressively gender neutral, with men and women killing and dying with equal relish (plaudits to Pom Klementieff, whose relentless \u2013 and largely silent \u2013 assassin, Paris, could give Grace Jones in A View to a Kill a run for her money). It all builds to a frankly jaw-dropping train-bound finale in which the heavily trailered sight of the real Tom Cruise really driving a real motorbike off a real mountaintop is only an appetiser for what is to come \u2013 one of the most audaciously extended action set pieces I have ever seen, which left my nails not so much bitten as gnawed to the bone. The fact that this is \u201conly the beginning\u201d is cause for celebration. Roll on Dead Reckoning Part Two."

    "text": "Photo courtesy Paramount Pictures and Skydance\n\nThis week\u2019s report takes an early look at possible box office trajectories for the seventh installment of the Mission: Impossible film franchise, alongside tracking updates for other upcoming releases.\n\nUpdates for No Hard Feelings; Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny; and Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken, plus other forecast updates, are in the table below.\n\nMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nJuly 11, 2023 (WIDE)\n\n3-Day Opening Weekend Range: $65M-$80M\n\nDomestic Total Range: $250M-$320M\n\nPROS:\n\nSelling points for Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One include not only the critical and commercial success of its 2018 predecessor, Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout, but the enormous goodwill earned by star Tom Cruise from last year\u2019s Top Gun: Maverick. These two factors combine for a potentially significant wave of momentum heading into Dead Reckoning Part One\u2018s release, as audiences look forward to Cruise\u2019s continuation of the long-running action franchise and its marquee real-life stunts.\n\nDead Reckoning\u2018s first day of pre-sales in sampled North American markets registered 8 percent above those of John Wick: Chapter 4 and just 15 percent behind Fast X. With the Mission: Impossible franchise typically being less frontloaded than the Fast and Furious films\u2014and with the fact that several other high-profile films are competing for pre-sales dollars\u2014that\u2019s a very encouraging early sign.\n\nPremium formats should be a strong component of the Mission: Impossible franchise\u2019s box office once again. This is particularly true of Imax, which featured a special making-of sequence for Dead Reckoning running in front of Maverick as an early marketing piece last year.\n\nMission: Impossible films have historically played longer than moreyouth-driven franchises, positioning this sequel to enjoy a leggy run through the back half of summer.\n\nSocial media sentiment has been consistently enthusiastic with the release of each trailer and featurette. Christopher McQuarrie, director of this entry and the previous two, has played a significant role in helping drum up buzz by posting various behind-the-scenes tidbits and announcements over the past few years.\n\nDead Reckoning\u2018s recent push up from a Friday to Wednesday release, with various preview dates also in play, helps give the film some extra time in theaters\u2014and on premium screens\u2014before Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer opens the following week.\n\nCONS:\n\nWith Oppenheimer slated to release nine days after Dead Reckoning, commanding most of the Imax and premium footprint for several weeks, crossover competition for both premium screens and the adult male audience will be notable. Fallout drew a 55 percent male and 59 percent age 35-plus opening weekend demographic share in 2018, while Nolan\u2019s Dunkirk pulled a 60 percent male lead with 76 percent over the age of 25.\n\nOn a similar note, if Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\u2014out less than two weeks before Dead Reckoning\u2018s Wednesday opening\u2014were to draw healthy word of mouth, its chase weeks at the box office could be a strong player for some of Dead Reckoning\u2018s target audience.\n\nWith the move to a Wednesday release, plus several instances of early access shows and previews, forecast models will be more volatile than when the film was slated for a traditional Friday opening.\n\nAs the first of what\u2019s presumed to be the two-part finale of Cruise\u2019s tenure with the franchise, it remains to be seen if word of mouth will be as strong as has it been for the last few entries. A cliffhanger ending, if that comes to pass, for a 163-minute movie could be a blow to the series\u2019 typical crowd-pleasing nature, depending on the tone of the film\u2019s denouement.\n\nLong Range Box Office Forecast & 2023\u2019s Upcoming Calendar\n\n(as of 6/16/23)\n\nRelease Date Title 3-Day (FSS) Opening Low/High Range Pinpoint % Chg from Last Week Domestic Total Low/High Range Pinpoint % Chg from Last Week Distributor 6/23/2023 Asteroid City (Expansion) Focus Features 6/23/2023 No Hard Feelings $10,000,000 \u2013 $15,000,000 -13% $32,500,000 \u2013 $52,000,000 -13% Sony Pictures 6/23/2023 Past Lives (Wide Expansion) A24 6/30/2023 Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny $68,000,000 \u2013 $102,000,000 $211,000,000 \u2013 $325,000,000 Disney / Lucasfilm 6/30/2023 Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken $13,000,000 \u2013 $18,000,000 -12% $38,000,000 \u2013 $66,000,000 -12% Universal / DreamWorks Animation 7/7/2023 Insidious: The Red Door $25,000,000 \u2013 $33,000,000 $56,000,000 \u2013 $76,000,000 Sony Pictures / Screen Gems 7/7/2023 Joy Ride $12,000,000 \u2013 $17,000,000 $40,000,000 \u2013 $64,000,000 Lionsgate 7/12/2023 Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One $65,000,000 \u2013 $80,000,000 $250,000,000 \u2013 $320,000,000 Paramount Pictures\n\nUnless otherwise noted, all figures above represent best and worst case scenarios for how each respective film is currently tracking based on existing market conditions and projected model fluctuation at the time of this report\u2019s publication date.

    "text": "Tom Cruise began filming the latest installment of Mission Impossible with a death-defying stunt. For the Hollywood star, there was no time to waste.\n\nIn Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One, Cruise would be seen doing several high-octane stunts, one of which includes riding a motorbike off a cliff and base jumping. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Cruise was asked why he chose to begin the film with the hair-raising stunt.\n\n\u201cWell, that way we\u2019d know either we are going to continue with the film or not! \u2018Let\u2019s know on day one what is going to happen, do we all continue or is it a major rewrite,\u201d Cruise quipped. The Hollywood star got into the specifics of the scene and said it was crucial he shot the stunt on the first day of filming as he didn\u2019t want to put that aside and shoot other things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut preparing for something like that was years (of experience). I had been riding motorcycles since I was a little kid, raced cars and spent a lot of time with aerobatics, airplanes, helicopters, parachutes. But to figure out something like that\u2026 It is our understanding of story, understanding of camera, how to do something like that, it all kind of came in that moment. I had trained f0r it, you have to be razor sharp when you do something like that.\n\nAlso read | The eyes of Cillian Murphy\n\n\u201cIt was very important as we were prepping the film that the stunt actually was the first thing. Because I don\u2019t want to drop that and shoot other things, and have my mind somewhere else. Everyone was prepped. You don\u2019t want to be waking up in the middle of the night thinking, \u2018I still have that left to do,'\u201d he added.\n\nChristopher McQuarrie, who previously helmed Rogue Nation and Fallout, has directed Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, ready to hit screens on July 12. He has also directed the sequel, which will release in 2024."

Clearly he made the right decision, as the follow-up ranked as the top film globally of the entire year, the only Mission installment to achieve the feat. Domestically it ranked third, behind How the Grinch Stole Christmas and Cast Away.\n\nCostarring Anthony Hopkins as the mission commander, John Woo (Face/Off) directed the project. Cruise even insisted that the production use a real knife during a climactic fight scene, rather than a prop.\n\nMission: Impossible III (2006)\n\nRelease Date: Friday, May 5, 2006\n\nDomestic Opening Weekend: $47.7M\n\nDomestic Total / Market Share: $133.5M (33%)\n\nOverseas Total / Market Share: $265.8M (67%)\n\nGlobal Total: $399.3M\n\nDomestic Franchise Rank: #6\n\nGlobal Franchise Rank: #6\n\nDomestic 2006 Rank: #14\n\nGlobal 2006 Rank: #8\n\nJ.J. Abrams made his feature film directorial debut, previously serving as executive producer for ABC\u2019s television shows Alias and Lost, though he would go on to helm two Star Wars and two Star Trek movies. This third Mission installment also costarred Philip Seymour Hoffman as the franchise\u2019s most memorable villain, Laurence Fishburne as the agency director and Simon Pegg as tech expert Benji Tunn, who would appear in every subsequent installment.\n\nMission: Impossible \u2014 Ghost Protocol (2011)\n\nRelease Date: Friday, December 16, 2011\n\nDomestic Opening Weekend: $12.7M in limited release, $29.5M wide\n\nDomestic Total / Market Share: $209.3M (30%)\n\nOverseas Total / Market Share: $485.3M (70%)\n\nGlobal Total: $694.7M\n\nDomestic Franchise Rank: #3\n\nGlobal Franchise Rank: #2\n\nDomestic 2011 Rank: #7\n\nGlobal 2011 Rank: #5\n\nThe series returned with a December release date, marking the only installment to shun a summer debut. It also marked the only installment not to debut wide, starting in a limited 465 theaters before expanding wide on its sophomore frame.\n\nAs a result, it\u2019s the only franchise installment not to debut atop the weekend box office. In fact, it debuted in third, behind both Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows and Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked. Yet with strong legs, it finished above both Shadows and Chipwrecked in the end.\n\nBrad Bird made his live-action directorial debut, after previously directing Pixar\u2019s animated The Incredibles and Ratatouille.

    "text": "Diverse content, driving revenue through premium formats, streamers on the big screen, and the Cineworld succession plan dominated conversations between distributors and exhibitors in Barcelona attending CineEurope, the annual trade convention for cinema operators which ran June 19-22.\n\nTheatrical is key to studio strategy\n\nHow do you make a crowdpleaser without a crowd? Variants of that question were posed repeatedly during the four days of this year\u2019s CineEurope event \u2013 the annual get-together for European cinema operators in Barcelona, which wraps today with a screening of Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny, followed by an awards ceremony. Disney, Universal, Sony, Warner Bros and Paramount all delivered slick slate presentations trumpeting upcoming titles, and consistently pushing the message of \u201csomething for everyone\u201d, a wide offering \u201cacross multiple genres\u201d, \u201cmajor IP and original stories\u201d and \u201cfilms that demand to be seen on the big screen\u201d.\n\nThe theatrical window may have reduced significantly since before the pandemic, but studios sought to banish memories of their 2020 pivot to digital and streaming releases, reminding attendees that their films will be released \u201cexclusively in theatres\u201d \u2013 a necessary message in the case of a film such as Universal\u2019s Trolls Band Together (Trolls World Tour premiered on premium video on demand).\n\nTentpole king Disney pushed the diversity message, stating that its 17 releases for the next 12 months spanned all seven of its studio brands: Marvel, Lucasfilm, Pixar, Disney (live action), Disney Animation, 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures.\n\nThe need for more diverse content was discussed on day one at CineEurope on the senior executive panel. Andrew Cripps, president of international distribution at Warner Bros Pictures International, stated that \u201cWe\u2019re still producing fewer movies, we\u2019re still catching up. We don\u2019t have the same quality of diversity we had pre-pandemic.\u201d He added that he has also observed a phenomenon of \u201chaves and have-nots\u201d, explaining, \u201cMovies that are doing well are doing as well as they ever did, but movies that are not performing are doing worse than ever.\u201d\n\nNiels Swinkels, EVP and MD of international distribution at Universal Pictures, had a positive story of volume and diversity to tell at his own studio and its Focus Features division, but added, \u201cThere\u2019s no question that we need more flow of that product [appealing to specialised and older audiences].\u201d\n\nTalent is key\n\nWhile studio executives and distribution bosses led the slate presentations on stage at Barcelona\u2019s international convention centre (CCIB), the companies as much as possible sought to foreground filmmaker talent, with content introduced via filmed pieces from creators. Universal did this most impactfully by beginning its presentation with messages from Steven Spielberg and a host of others, including Christopher Nolan, Jordan Peele, Jason Blum, Chris Meledandri, Jon M Chu, Wes Anderson, Alexander Payne, James Wan, Elizabeth Banks, the Daniels, Louis Leterrier, and Phil Lord and Chris Miller.\n\nFilm technology companies got in on the act, with sponsorship reels co-opting filmmakers enthusing why a particular format is the best way to see and hear their own films. Initially impactful, the tactic became subject to diminishing returns, as the hyperbole lost efficacy through repetition.\n\nBeing in the room where it happens\n\nWhat\u2019s better than filmed talent introductions? Bringing talent to the room, of course \u2013 and this year, more studios made the effort to bring stars to Barcelona, recalling pre-pandemic times. No Tom Cruise this year, despite some anticipation given that Paramount played the whole of Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, and in recent years Cruise has become essentially the poster boy of CineEurope. But Warner Bros offered its own TC: Timothee Chalamet, who was joined by Zendaya to talk about Denis Villeneuve\u2019s Dune: Part Two, and then returned to tell the exhibitors about Paul King\u2019s Wonka, alongside producer David Heyman.\n\nZendaya likewise performed double duties, introducing Luca Guadagnino\u2019s tennis-star love-triangle drama Challengers, in which she stars alongside Mike Faist and Josh O\u2019Connor, and produces with Guadagnino and Amy Pascal. For Sony, Aaron Taylor-Johnson introduced the trailer for Kraven The Hunter, where the emphasis was on the fact this is \u201cdefinitely R-rated\u201d and a change of pace from Sony\u2019s previous Marvel films.\n\nDisney closed its presentation with a live performance of a song from Wish \u2013 the new film for the holiday season from Disney Animation, with a voice cast including Ariane DeBose and Chris Pine. Danielle Fiamanya from the Frozen stage musical performed newly composed song \u2018This Wish\u2019.\n\nDon\u2019t forget the little guys\n\nSlate presentations from the big five studios were complemented by a presentation from Lionsgate spotlighting its prequel Hunger Games: The Ballad Of Songbirds And Snakes; as well as slates from Studiocanal, Mubi and Creative Europe/Unifrance. Studiocanal got in on the talent act, beginning with a filmed piece with Olivia Colman and Jessie Buckley, stars of its upcoming Wicked Little Letters, and then bringing Colman to the stage. The session ended with director Sam Taylor-Johnson and producer Alison Owen introducing footage from their Amy Winehouse biopic, Back To Black.\n\nSpeaking of little guys, Warner Bros revealed a key scene from Wonka, introducing Hugh Grant as the first Oompa-Loompa Timothee Chalamet\u2019s aspiring chocolatier ever meets \u2013 and staying true to Roald Dahl\u2019s text that the character be \u201cknee high\u201d.\n\nThe Apple beauty contest\n\nApple is releasing three films theatrically via studios over the next nine months: Martin Scorsese\u2019s Killers Of The Flower Moon via Paramount; Ridley Scott\u2019s Napoleon via Sony; and Matthew Vaughn\u2019s Argylle via Universal. The studios are presumably under no illusion that they are competing to deliver the most effective partnership with Apple. These titles were seamlessly and prominently incorporated into the studios\u2019 presentations.\n\nComedy cuts through\n\nFour days of back-to-back panels and slate presentations \u2013 studios correctly surmised that the gathered assembly of cinema exhibitors needed a laugh along the way. Warner Bros executives Cripps and Danielle Bekas gamely acted in a cute clip in Barbie\u2019s pink convertible driving to the airport to get to CineEurope (Warner Bros showed the first 20 minutes of Barbie in its slate presentation), but really there is no point in trying to compete with Mark Viane, Paramount Pictures International president, who this year was shown accepting an impossible mission to bring his studio presentation to CineEurope, outfoxing an array of known subversives and devious operators (a rogue\u2019s gallery including leaders of CineEurope presenting partner the International Union of Cinemas, and organisers Bob and Andrew Sunshine). Born showman Viane, bewigged as Tom Cruise, spoofed various memorable stunts from the Ethan Hunt oeuvre, and then entered the stage dragging a parachute in his wake.\n\nParty gossip\n\nHours of social interaction among the thousands of attendees gave plenty of opportunity for discussing the footage presented by studios. We are embargoed from detailing or reviewing the content (and sought studio permission even to mention the clips shown), but attendees were buzzed about titles including Universal\u2019s Oppenheimer, Sony\u2019s Gran Turismo (with extensive footage shown), Warner Bros\u2019 Wonka, Paramount\u2019s Bob Marley: One Love and Disney\u2019s The Creator.\n\nBets were taken on the likely global box office for Paramount\u2019s Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One. The studio will be looking for a \u201cTop Gun: Maverick effect\u201d, adding a halo to the box office, and pushing it beyond the $755m achieved globally by 2018\u2019s Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout. Dead Reckoning would have a long way to go, though, to match the near $1.5bn of Top Gun: Maverick.\n\nIndustry gossip topics also included the likely succession plan at the insolvent Cineworld Group, as well as, for UK attendees, what exiting Curzon CEO Philip Knatchbull will likely do next.\n\nAt the well-attended party for Vista Group on Tuesday night, two UK attendees came up with the same three candidates as possible successors to CEO Mooky Griedinger, presumably from the same source, which may or may not have any validity. Take it with a pinch of salt, but: John Fithian, who has just stepped down as CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO); an unnamed \u201cformer CEO\u201d of Regal Entertainment Group, the US exhibitor acquired by Cineworld in 2017 (Amy Miles was Regal CEO at the time); and, intriguingly, Tim Richards, founder and CEO of Vue Entertainment.\n\nPremium is king\n\nWhile there is a plentiful array of premium formats, technologies and experiences for cinemas to invest in, it\u2019s been hard to predict which, if any, would prove the definitive winner for audiences. But exhibitors still biding their time to see which investment choice to make might consider the consensus that is emerging: premium is king, across multiple formats.\n\nComscore\u2019s Lucy Jones, in her box office presentation on day one, showed how it\u2019s premium ticket prices that are saving the day for box office (at least, relative to admissions), as audiences choose premium experiences, especially for tentpole blockbusters. Jones cited the case of Germany, where the average ticket price in 2022 was \u20ac10.09 (up from \u20ac8.68 for the pre-pandemic average of 2017-2019), but for Avatar: The Way Of Water the average ticket price was \u20ac13, \u201cbecause everybody was choosing the kind of premium seating, the big screen, the excellent sound, the VIP package\u201d.\n\nJones added that during the pandemic, with venues ordered closed, \u201ca lot of cinemas took the opportunity to do innovation, improving the experience for the customer, which has enabled them to put up the prices, and the customers are very happy to still come\u201d.\n\nBridging the skills gap\n\nThe challenge of recruiting, developing and retaining staff is real and present for many cinema operators, as was highlighted in a panel session announcing UNIC\u2019s new People Programme. The board\u2019s chair Dee Vassilli, chief people officer at Vue International, participated in the session with Phil Clapp, wearing his hat as president of UNIC and the programme\u2019s deputy chair. Clapp highlighted the issue of the rise in antisocial behaviour, which has been witnessed in cinemas (and other out-of-home entertainment venues) since the pandemic, and creating challenges for staff, which in cinemas\u2019 cases can often be young, relatively inexperienced, and ill-equipped to deal with it.\n\nThe specific challenge of recruiting tech-savvy cinema projection staff was highlighted in a session titled Behind the Screens: Bridging Staff Shortages and Skills Gaps in Cinema.\n\nDon\u2019t recycle \u2013 reuse instead\n\nReusable is coming to cinemas, whether operators like it or not, as a result of EU or national government directives, consumer demand, and expectation from cinema staff. This year\u2019s Coca-Cola Sustainability Seminar, chaired by the busy and often seen (on panels) Nick Gault, the brand\u2019s away from home customers director, looked at how reusable cups will be offered, either as an alternative, or the only solution, for dispensing cold beverages in cinemas.\n\nNew research presented by Coca-Cola showed that a reusable cup only needs to be used seven times before earning back its cost, even when factoring in washing and collection costs, and that number \u2013 seven times \u2013 is the same when considering environmental impact and sustainability.\n\nA major challenge for the reuse model is that, unlike glassware, plastic cups do not emerge from dishwashers hot, and so water does not naturally evaporate \u2013 extending dry times, and creating operational inefficiencies. Andreas Hufer from Germany\u2019s Kinopolis, which was among the first to convert to reuse, revealed that there are now two German manufacturers making washer-driers specifically for venues using plastic cups.\n\nThis year, CineEurope itself switched to 100% reusable cups when dispensing cold drinks to delegates, and it was notable that these cups contained around 350ml of drink \u2013 a portion size seldom offered by actual multiplex venues, at least from Screen\u2019s own experience.\n\nA question to the panel from Screen International at the Sustainability Seminar about beverage portion size and pricing, which currently typically incentivises customers to upsize \u2013 hardly a win for sustainability and health goals \u2013 provoked a lively response and further conversations during the convention.\n\nOne UK exhibitor told us that a small cup size, priced cheaply, would cut average customer spend on food and beverage (F&B), which is revenue that UK multiplexes simply cannot afford to lose in the current economic climate. The challenge for cinemas is to offer food and beverages that will attract a high customer spend, and retain a high margin of profitability, without incentivising giant portion sizes.\n\nThe elephant in the room\n\nThe studios were happy to trumpet a full complement of releases in their 2023 and 2024 release schedules, but there is a significant threat to future flow of product that did not receive any mention in the main auditorium. However, Tim Richards, founder and CEO of Vue International did place the topic on the agenda when asked at the senior executive panel what would make a successful year. \u201cSolving the writers\u2019 strike\u201d was his pithy reply."

    "text": "Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One might be another blockbuster for Tom Cruise after last year\u2019s Top Gun: Maverick, as per box office projections. The Hollywood Reporter, citing polling estimates, stated that the spy actioner might pocket an impressive $90 million after its initial five-day run at the domestic commercial window.\n\nThe five-day release is because Dead Reckoning Part One will hit theaters on Wednesday, July 12. The collection has been calculated until Sunday, July 16, which is admittedly a terrific start for the much-awaited tentpole.\n\nHowever, the numbers elicited mixed reactions on Twitter. As soon as Discussing Film disclosed the earnings, one of the users remarked that Barbie and Oppenheimer \"are going to sweep\" upon their release.\n\nFan reacting to box office news shared by DF. (Photo via Twitter/Sportskeeda)\n\nNotably, Barbie and Oppenheimer are opening on July 21, a week after Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One. And as per a recent report, Oppenheimer\u2019s wide IMAX capture has Cruise all riled up.\n\nThe Puck report stated that while Dead Reckoning Part One will enjoy an IMAX release for the first week, it will lose it all when Oppenheimer hits theaters. The Christopher Nolan directorial will apparently be shown on all IMAX screens across the US due to an exclusive deal, which has reportedly angered Cruise.\n\nBox office opening numbers for Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One leave netizens divided\n\nIn its piece, The Hollywood Reporter said that Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One will collect a solid $65 million or probably more over the three-day weekend and reach a minimum of $90 million at the end of five days of its premiere.\n\nThis will even top 2018\u2019s Mission: Impossible \u2014 Fallout, which boasts the titular franchise\u2019s highest opener at $61.2 million (not adjusted for inflation). The Christopher McQuarrie directorial is the seventh installment of the series and is expected to be the best performer of all.\n\nHowever, it seems the projected opening score has left netizens divided. While many vociferously supported Tom Cruise and the movie, several voiced doubts after the popular cultural portal Discussing Film tweeted the statistic.\n\nFans reacting to box office news shared by DF. (Photo via Twitter/Sportskeeda)\n\nFans divided over box office news shared by DF. (Photo via Twitter/Sportskeeda)\n\nFans reacting to box office news shared by DF. (Photo via Twitter/Sportskeeda)\n\nIn a separate article, The Hollywood Reporter said that Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One will release in China on July 14, almost the same day as North America. This is a smart strategic move given that the Asian country is the world\u2019s second-biggest theatrical commercial market and that the team will save on promotional and marketing budgets.\n\nCruise\u2019s Top Gun: Maverick wasn\u2019t released there on political grounds, so Dead Reckoning might just compensate for the hunger of his fans in that country.\n\nMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One hits theaters on July 12."

Not much is known about about both films but ComicBook.com's Brandon Davis had the chance to speak with Simon Pegg in promotion of Part One and the actor teased what fans could expect from Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part Two.\n\n\"Well, whether or not Benji makes it into Part Two, which I obviously can't divulge in the true style of Mission: Impossible,\" Pegg told us, \"There will be another dial on the, you know, another notch on the dial will get turned on, and it's coming to something incredible. I love the fact that this film feels like, even though it's Part One, because it's so relentlessly paced and so sort of engaging, you get to the end of it and you're like, Okay, I can wait for the next one; you know, let me just take a break, and then we'll see what happens next.\"\n\nWhat is Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One About?\n\nTom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, which premieres in theaters on July 12th. It's the beginning of the end for the action-packed franchise, as Cruise reteams with longtime collaborator and filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie for more death-defying and breathtaking stunts. Hunt and allies Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) attempt to track down a new weapon with the power to tear the world apart. Actors Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, and Esai Morales join the cast for the latest installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise, which is set to wrap up with Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part Two.\n\nMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One hits theaters on July 12th while Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part Two is currently expected to be released on June 28, 2024, but could be delayed due to the ongoing WGA strike.\n\nWhat do you think about Simon Pegg's comments?

    "text": "Pick your poison, action-franchise edition circa 2023: balletically choreographed carnage; cars, kin and Coronas; or Tom Cruise constantly one-upping himself in the megastar stunts stakes. Hollywood loves them all. Cinemas keep welcoming them all. So, after John Wick: Chapter 4 and Fast X comes Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One to deliver the kind of movie spectacle that always looks best on the biggest and brightest of silver screens. And, as its lead actor's gleaming teeth do, the seventh instalment in the TV-to-film spy series shines. Like Cruise himself, it's committed to giving audiences what they want to see, but never merely exactly what they've already seen. This saga hasn't always chosen to accept that mission, but it's been having a better time of it since 2011's Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol, including when writer/director Christopher McQuarrie jumped behind the lens with 2015's Mission: Impossible \u2013 Rogue Nation.\n\nMcQuarrie and Cruise have history; McQuarrie first helmed Cruise in 2012's Jack Reacher, and also penned or co-penned the screenplays for the Cruise-starring Valkyrie, Edge of Tomorrow, The Mummy and Top Gun: Maverick before and during their Mission: Impossible collaboration. Prior to that, however \u2014 the year before Mission: Impossible was reborn as a movie, in fact \u2014 the filmmaker won an Oscar for writing The Usual Suspects. Take the puzzle-like trickery of that mid-90s big-reveal mystery, combine it with Cruise's determination to score the first Academy Award for Best Stunts if and when it's ever introduced (or die trying), and it's plain to see why they make an ace Mission: Impossible pair. With both 2018's Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout and now Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One in particular, they ensure that a franchise based on a half-century-old formula courtesy of Mission: Impossible's television days still feels fresh and thrilling.\n\nRubber masks so realistic that anyone on-screen could rip off their face to reveal Cruise's Ethan Hunt? Of course they're present and accounted for. Espionage antics that involve saving the world while traversing much of it? Tick that off ASAP. The saga's main Impossible Missions Force operative doing whatever it takes, including sprinting everywhere and relentlessly exasperating his higher-ups? Check. A trusty crew faithfully aiding the always-maverick Hunt, plus slippery adversaries to endeavour to outsmart? Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One gives them a hefty thumbs up as well. Shady forces with globe-destroying aims, being able to trust oh-so-few folks, wreaking slickly staged havoc, those jaw-dropping stunts, top-notch actors: Cruise and McQuarrie, the latter co-writing with Erik Jendresen (Ithaca), feel the need to feed it all into the flick, too. They're also rather fond of nodding to and reworking the franchise's greatest hits. Happily playing with recognisable pieces while eagerly, cleverly and satisfyingly building upon them isn't the easiest of skills, but it's firmly in this team's arsenal.\n\nWhen Mission: Impossible \u2014 Rogue Nation labelled Hunt \"the living manifestation of destiny\", it wasn't the series' finest piece of dialogue. There's a sense of humour about hearing him called \"a mind-reading, shape-shifting incarnation of chaos\" in Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One, though. That description could also be directed at Hunt, Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames, Legacy) and Benji Dunn's (Simon Pegg, The Boys) latest timely enemy: The Entity, an artificial intelligence that's literally killer. Unlike in The Terminator flicks, this AI is content without mechanical bodies to control. Whether in Russian submarines, Abu Dhabi's airport or on careening trains, it does a commanding job of bending both computer programs and people to its will. The aim: to secure that power, a quest that Hunt is on a mission to thwart.\n\nReturning from the OG 1996 movie, IMF head Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny, Scream VI) initially gives Hunt and company their orders \u2014 and once this troupe has been set in motion, little can stop it. So, when the crew punches its \"get disavowed by the government again\" card, they still stick to the task of tracking down the two-part key that The Entity wants. Terrorist Gabriel (Esai Morales, How to Get Away with Murder) and assassin Paris (Pom Klementieff, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) are on the AI's side. Jasper Briggs (Shea Whigham, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse) is among the US operatives trying to bring in Hunt. Back from the last instalment, arms dealer White Widow (Vanessa Kirby, The Son) has her own plan, while ex-MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson, Silo) appears in her third flick in a row to again link in with the usual team. Then there's pickpocket Grace (Hayley Atwell, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness), a newcomer who is accustomed to flying solo.\n\nAtwell and Klementieff are scene-stealing additions to the cast, and the always-great Ferguson has been a standout since Mission: Impossible \u2013 Rogue Nation. Still, as has been teased, talked about and splashed across Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One's poster, Cruise is the one actually physically soaring. What would a Mission: Impossible movie be without flaunting its riskiest stunt, as performed by its stratospheric name himself, as audience bait? Not a McQuarrie-era chapter, that's for sure. When the scene arrives, getting Cruise riding a motorcycle off a towering cliff in an effort to land aboard the hurtling Orient Express, it is indeed breathtaking \u2014 and a gripping, nerve-shredding sight to behold. It isn't alone, though, thanks to a tense underwater opening, cat-and-mouse airport antics, Arabian desert horse chases, Fiat-driving Italian Job-style Rome romps and the high-stakes hijinks on Agatha Christie's favourite locomotive itself. Cinematographer Fraser Taggart (Robot Overlords) and editor Eddie Hamilton (back from the last two movies), plus the entire stunt team, help shoot, splice and execute these setpieces rivetingly. Repeatedly besting past Mission: Impossible action triumphs? Mission: accomplished.\n\nTwenty-seven years, notching up three pictures now with McQuarrie at the helm, and with Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part Two obviously on the way (arrival: June 2024), there's a well-oiled air to Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One. That said, to run so smoothly requires care, aka someone doing the oiling, which is why there's rarely a well-worn moment or element be seen. Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One covers some ground that John Wick: Chapter 4 and Fast X already have in 2023 (and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny as well). It eagerly nods to its own past. And it knows that Cruise could just cruise-control his way through, as could his co-stars, if they wanted. Its biggest feat? Lifting everything that it does, and that a Mission: Impossible flick must, again and again so that seeming routine proves, yes, impossible. There's no self-destruction here \u2014 just devotion to an intense and entertaining action extravaganza."

Ford\u2019s not alone. Brad Pitt did it. Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro did it. Samuel Jackson and Will Smith did it, too.\n\nSo, while there will be no younger Cruise in Dead Reckoning Part One, the research process opened the doors for a potential peak at a younger Cruise on a future project, McQuarrie said.\n\n\u201cIn researching that [technology], I cracked the code \u2013 I think \u2013 on how best to approach it,\u201d McQuarrie told Total Film. \u201cBy then, we had kind of moved away from it. We may still play with it. We never say never.\u201d\n\nMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One is in theaters now.\n\nFor more on Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, check out these stories:\n\n\u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d Reviews: Cruise & Co.

    "text": "Christopher McQuarrie says he briefly considered casting a major actress for what would have been a small role in the latest Mission: Impossible movie.\n\nAs Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One filmmaker McQuarrie, 54, appeared on Empire magazine's Spoiler Special Film podcast recently, the director recalled that as the production considered de-aging Tom Cruise for a flashback sequence in the new movie, he briefly wondered whether he could book Julia Roberts to act alongside the actor.\n\n\"I said, 'OK, if I were doing this sequence, it would be Tom in, say, 1989,' \" McQuarrie recalled on the podcast, noting that he believed the late Tony Scott (True Romance) would have been a good pick to direct a late '80s Mission: Impossible movie.\n\n\"We looked at Days of Thunder and we looked at the style of it, and we started thinking what would it look like if Tony Scott had shot this, and who would it have been?\" the director continued, according to a /Film transcription of the podcast appearance. \"I looked back at who was the ingenue, who was the breakout star in 1989? And right around then was Mystic Pizza. And I was like, 'Oh my God. Julia Roberts, a then-pre-Pretty Woman Julia Roberts, as this young woman.' \"\n\nMcQuarrie continued to note that he decided he only would want to de-age Cruise for the flashback if he could \"somehow convince Julia Roberts to come in and be this small role at the beginning of this story.\"\n\nFlixPix/Alamy\n\nAs McQuarrie considered his options, though, he decided seeking out digital de-aging \u2014 and the fees the production would incur from casting an A-list star like Roberts \u2014 were not worth what he envisioned for the scene.\n\n\"As you're conceptually going through it, you're like, 'Now all anybody's going to be doing is thinking about the de-aging of Julia Roberts, and Esai [Morales], and Tom, and Henry Czerny,' \" the director said. \"And then I got the bill for de-aging those people before their salaries were even factored into it.\"\n\nNever miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n\"And if you put two of them in a shot together, or three of them in a shot together, it would have been as expensive as the train by the time we were done,\" he added.\n\n\n\nRather than spend time and money on de-aging all the actors involved, the latest Mission: Impossible movie kept the flashback sequence simple and avoided showing the faces of 61-year-old Cruise or 60-year-old Morales, who plays a villain named Gabriel. Mariela Garriga plays Marie in those flashbacks; she's expected to return in the role for the film's forthcoming sequel Dead Reckoning Part Two.\n\n\n\nTIZIANA FABI/AFP via Getty\n\nWhile the new film did not include any digital de-aging of its principal star, Cruise did perform what McQuarrie once called \"by far the most dangerous stunt we've ever done\" with his now-famous motorbike jump off a cliff for the movie.\n\n\n\nAside from Cruise, Morales and Garriga, the latest entry in Cruise's decades-long action series also stars Hayley Atwell, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, Pom Klementieff, Ving Rhames, Henry Czerny, Shea Whigham, Greg Tarzan Davis, Charles Parnell, Frederick Schmidt, Cary Elwes, Mark Gatiss, Indira Varma and Rob Delaney.\n\n\n\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is in theaters now.\n\n"

Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore, call it \"a touchstone moment for movies, moviegoers and movie theaters.\"\"Having two movies from rival studios linked in this way and both boosting each other's fortunes \u2014 both box-office wise and it terms of their profile \u2014 I don't know if there's a comp for this in the annals of box-office history,\" said Dergarabedian. \"There's really no comparison for this.\"Following its year-best $162 million opening, the pink-infused pop sensation of \"Barbie\" saw remarkably sustained business through the week and into the weekend. The film outpaced Nolan's \"The Dark Knight\" to have the best first 11 days in theaters of any Warner Bros. release ever.\"Barbie\" has rapidly accumulated $351.4 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters, a rate that will soon make it the biggest box-office hit of the summer. Every day it's played, \"Barbie\" has made at least $20 million.And the \"Barbie\" effect isn't just in North America. The film made $122.2 million internationally over the weekend. Its global tally has reached $775 million. It's the kind of business that astounds even veteran studio executives.\"That's a crazy number,\" said Jeff Goldstein, distribution chief for Warner Bros. \"There's just a built-in audience that wants to be part of the zeitgeist of the moment. Wherever you go, people are wearing pink. Pink is taking over the world.\"Amid the frenzy, \"Barbie\" is already attracting a lot of repeat moviegoers. Goldstein estimates that 12% of sales are people going back with friends or family to see it again.For a movie industry that has be trying to regain its pre-pandemic footing \u2014 and that now finds itself largely shuttered due to actors and screenwriters strikes \u2014 the sensations of \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" have showed what's possible when everything lines up just right.\"Post-pandemic, there's no ceiling and there's no floor,\" said Goldstein. \"The movies that miss, really miss big time and the movies that work really work big time.\"Universal Pictures' \"Oppenheimer,\" meanwhile, is performing more like a superhero movie than a three-hour film about scientists talking.Nolan's drama starring Cillian Murphy as atomic bomb physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer has accrued $174.1 million domestically thus far. With an additional $72.4 million in international cinemas, \"Oppenheimer\" has already surpassed $400 million globally.Showings in IMAX have typically been sold out. \"Oppenheimer\" has made $80 million worldwide on IMAX. The large-format exhibitor said Sunday that it will extend the film's run through Aug. 13.The week's top new release, Walt Disney Co.'s \"Haunted Mansion,\" an adaptation of the Disney theme park attraction, was easily overshadowed by the \"Barbenheimer\" blitz. The film, which cost about $150 million, debuted with $24 million domestically and $9 million in overseas sales. \"Haunted Mansion,\" directed by Justin Simien (\"Dear White People,\" \"Bad Hair\") and starring an ensemble of LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish, Owen Wilson, Danny DeVito and Rosario Dawson, struggled to overcome mediocre reviews.\"Talk to Me,\" the A24 supernatural horror film, fared better. It debuted with $10 million. The film, directed by Australian filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou and starring Sophie Wilde, was a midnight premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January and received terrific reviews from critics (95% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes). It was made for a modest $4.5 million.While theaters being flush with moviegoers has been a huge boon to the film industry, it's been tougher sledding for Tom Cruise, the so-called savior of the movies last summer with \"Top Gun: Maverick.\" \"Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part I,\" which debuted the week before the arrival of \"Barbenheimer,\" grossed $10.7 million in its third weekend. The film starring Cruise and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, has grossed $139.2 million domestically and $309.3 million oveseas.Instead, the sleeper hit \"Sound of Freedom\" has been the best performing non-\"Barbenheimer\" release in theaters. The Angel Studios' release, which is counting crowdfunding pay-it-forward sales in its box office totals, made $12.4 million in its fourth weekend, bringing its haul thus far to nearly $150 million.Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.1. \"Barbie,\" $93 million.2. \"Opppenheimer,\" $46.2 million.3. \"Haunted Mansion,\" $24.2 million.4. \"Sound of Freedom,\" $12.4 million.5. \"Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning Part One,\" $10.7 million.6. \"Talk to Me,\" $10 million.7. \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,\" $4 million.8. \"Elemental,\" $3.4 million.9. \"Insidious: The Red Door,\" $3.2 million.10. \"Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani,\" $1.6 million."

    "text": "The very online showdown between Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cBarbie\u201d and Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer\u201d all started with a date: July 21.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for studios to counterprogram films in different genres on a big weekend, but the stark differences between an intense, serious-minded picture about the man who oversaw the development of the atomic bomb and a lighthearted, candy-colored anthropomorphizing of a childhood doll quickly became the stuff of viral fodder.\n\nThere\u2019s even some disagreement over whether it\u2019s \u201cBarbieheimer\u201d or \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d or \u201cBoppenheimer\u201d or yet another tortured portmanteau \u2014 a phenomenon on which the AP Stylebook has yet to offer guidance, but for the purposes of this article will be \u201cBarbenheimer.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t hurt that both Nolan and Gerwig have very passionate and very online fandoms eager to join in. Never mind that many of those fans overlap \u2014 the memes, allegiances, and T-shirts were just too fun.\n\nBoth movies often trend on social media when the other releases a new asset \u2014 a trailer, a picture, an interview. On one level, it\u2019s a marketing department\u2019s dream. Awareness could not be higher, the conversation couldn\u2019t be louder, and neither film even has official reviews out yet.\n\n\u201c\u2019Barbenheimer\u2019 is a marketing gift borne out of social media and I think it\u2019s benefiting both films,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for analytics firm Comscore. \u201cYou\u2019re certainly aware of both movies in a more profound and compelling way than I think might have otherwise happened had they been released on different weekends.\u201d\n\nAMC Theaters reported that 20,000 of its AMC Stubs members had purchased tickets for a double feature. If you\u2019re counting, that\u2019s 294 minutes of moviewatching. Even Margot Robbie \u2014 Barbie herself \u2014 and Tom Cruise, the star of another summer blockbuster, have started plotting the ideal \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect double bill,\u201d said Robbie at her movie\u2019s London premiere Wednesday. \u201cI think actually start your day with \u2018Barbie,\u2019 then go straight into \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 and then a \u2018Barbie\u2019 chaser.\u201d\n\nCruise \u2014 whose \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\u201d opened a little over a week before the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d showdown \u2014 said at his premiere he\u2019d plan to see both on their opening day, likely starting with \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d which seems to be the internet\u2019s preferred viewing order as well.\n\n\u201cBarbie\u201d actor Issa Rae thinks there\u2019s a reason for that.\n\n\u201cI think that there\u2019s a very specific order that if you see them in. If you see \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 last then you might be a bit of a psychopath,\u201d she diagnosed at the London premiere.\n\nThe showdown has made armchair marketing experts out of everyone, quick to scrutinize every move by Warner Bros. and Universal \u2014 as though it\u2019s possible to compare two extraordinarily different campaigns.\n\nOne has infinite opportunities for very pink, sparkly photo opportunities, whimsical brand partnerships for seemingly everything from underwear to pool floats, large-scale fan events with autograph signings and pop stars like Billie Eilish posting about the soundtrack. In other words, the \u201cBarbie\u201d campaign can go nuclear.\n\n\u201cOppenheimer\u201d has the bomb, the alluring mystery and the big screen hook, but it\u2019s not the kind of movie that lends itself to, say, a frozen yogurt collaboration.\n\nIs the competition real, though, or just a meme? Some in Hollywood wondered if Warner Bros. plopped \u201cBarbie\u201d on the weekend as a slight to Nolan, who had opened many films for the studio in that corridor including \u201cInception\u201d and \u201cDunkirk.\u201d He left Warner Bros. amid its controversial decision to send a year\u2019s worth of movies to streaming and made \u201cOppenheimer\u201d with Universal instead. But a pointed box office war doesn\u2019t exactly make sense for a studio that has talked recently about wanting to lure Nolan back.\n\nThere is an unspoken code of conduct: Never badmouth another studio\u2019s film, publicly at least. This is partly decorum, especially when it comes to \u201cbox office showdowns\u201d which all will say are a creation of the press and sideline spectators. But it\u2019s also rooted in some truth: The conventional thinking is that having eyes on one movie is good for other movies \u2014 you see their posters and trailers and on some level everyone benefits.\n\nAnd social media has allowed movie stars to get in on the game, too. Following reports that Cruise was irked the latest \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d was going to lose its IMAX screens to \u201cOppenheimer\u201d after only a week, Cruise posted photos of himself and director Christopher McQuarrie standing in front of posters for \u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,\u201d \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d holding tickets for each.\n\n\u201cThis summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters. These are just a few that we can\u2019t wait to see on the big screen,\u201d Cruise\u2019s Instagram caption read.\n\nThe official accounts for \u201cIndiana Jones,\u201d \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d responded with supportive notes. Gerwig and Robbie even followed with a similar photo series a few days later, which the official \u201cOppenheimer\u201d Instagram account reposted in its stories. Charged with playing Oppenheimer, Cillian Murphy told the AP at his movie\u2019s London premiere that \u201cof course\u201d he\u2019d be seeing \u201cBarbie.\u201d The sporting cross-promotion between four studios \u2014 Universal, Warner Bros., Disney and Paramount \u2014 is something the film business has not quite seen before.\n\n\u201cNot only is Tom Cruise the biggest box office star in the world, but he\u2019s also an incredible ambassador for the movie theater, for the movie theater experience and boosting other movies,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cAnd that collegial atmosphere within the framework of what is seen as the very competitive box office derby is kind of a nice thing.\u201d\n\nStill, everyone likes a No. 1 debut, and both \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d reportedly carry $100 million production price tags (not including the millions spent on marketing). As far as box office tracking goes, \u201cBarbie\u201d has it in the bag with forecasts showing that it could open above $90 million in North America. \u201cOppenheimer\u201d meanwhile is tracking in the $40 million range. Then there\u2019s the wild card of \u201cMission: Impossible 7\u2019s\u201d second weekend, which could snag second place.\n\nStill even with a second- or third-place start, \u201cOppenheimer\u201d could be destined for a long, steady, profitable run into awards season. Adult audiences for R-rated movies are not often the ones who pack theaters the first weekend.\n\nBack in 2008, in the midst of the recession, Warner Bros. and Universal faced off on the same July weekend with another Nolan film that went up against a lighthearted confection: \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d and \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d \u2014 both of which went on to be enormously profitable (though Nolan did win the first weekend).\n\nThe bigger worry is that what\u2019s been heralded as Hollywood\u2019s post-pandemic comeback summer has had more ups and downs than anyone might have hoped. That\u2019s putting quite a bit of pressure on \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d to overperform and boost the lagging summer box office, which pales in comparison to the bigger issues facing the industry as actors join the writers on strike.\n\nBut with just over a week to go, it\u2019s still a source of amusement. Even \u201cBarbie\u201d co-star Will Ferrell threw the gauntlet in his winking way at the London premiere.\n\n\u201cI think the world maybe wants to see \u2018Barbie\u2019 a little bit more right now,\u201d Ferrell said. \u201cJust saying!\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP journalist Sian Watson contributed from London."

    "text": "Hollywood megastar Tom Cruise has done it again with his new film \"Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One,\" which is filled with daring stunts, breathtaking action scenes, and his endless charisma. The film ignited wows from the audience at the China premiere in Beijing on Tuesday.\n\nActor Tom Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie pose on the set of \"Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One.\" [Photo courtesy of Paramount Pictures]\n\n\"We are constantly trying to build on every movie to bring you an absolutely unrivaled experience. Director Christopher McQuarrie and I have approached 'Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning' with that same commitment to practical filmmaking,\" Cruise said via a pre-recorded video before emphasizing how much he missed all his Chinese friends and fans.\n\nCruise visited China in 2018 to promote \"Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout.\" However, the COVID-19 pandemic and its lingering aftermath have nearly halted overseas promotional tours to China by foreign cast and crew. Despite these challenges, Chinese movie fans have eagerly followed the progress of the new installment of the popular action franchise. The critically acclaimed film is now set for release in Chinese theaters in various formats, including IMAX, on July 14.\n\nOver the course of its six installments and 27 years, the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise has gained popularity in China and holds significant relevance. The second installment was directed by Chinese director John Woo, while the third film, helmed by J.J. Abrams, was shot in Shanghai and the ancient water town of Xitang in Zhejiang province. China has imported nearly all of the \"Mission: Impossible\" installments, grossing a total of 2.9 billion yuan in the country. \"Fallout\" so far stands as the highest-grossing film in the franchise in China, earning 1.25 billion yuan.\n\n\"Dead Reckoning Part One,\" starring Cruise, Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Esai Morales, and Vanessa Kirby, is one of the most expensive films ever made and the most expensive in the franchise with an estimated budget of $291 million. It is also the longest in terms of runtime, spanning 156 minutes.\n\nA thrilling scene in \"Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One\" where characters fight for survival in a train wreck that dangles from a broken bridge. [Photo courtesy of Paramount Pictures]\n\nThis opening chapter in that two-movie arc sees Ethan Hunt and his IMF team on their most dangerous mission yet: trying to save the world from a mysterious, all-powerful artificial intelligence villain with the power to control the way humanity perceives reality. \"The stakes in this story are as global as global stakes get,\" said McQuarrie, also noting the key to crafting an engaging story is by tapping into the audience's emotions, which \"makes that action worth doing.\"\n\nThe most stunning stunts in the film include Cruise fighting on a moving train, engaging in a car chase on the streets of Rome, and, in particular, riding off a cliff on a motorbike. These stunts were performed during real takes, by Cruise himself, emphasizing practical filmmaking rather than relying on computer-generated visual effects.\n\nFor the motorbike scene, Cruise rode a motorbike off a purpose-built ramp on the side of a mountain in Norway, a vertiginous rock face situated approximately 1,200 meters above sea level \u2013 all on the first day of principal shooting on Sept. 6, 2020. He then descended 4,000 feet into the ravine below before opening his parachute at a mere 500 feet from the ground. While the director and a small crew breathed a collective sigh of relief after the first successful run, Cruise picked himself up and repeated the stunt seven more times, ensuring the footage was perfect.\n\nA photo captures the moment when Tom Cruise rides a motorbike off a cliff on a mountain in Norway. [Photo courtesy of Paramount Pictures]\n\nThe stunt was undeniably the most dangerous of Cruise's career, which is quite a statement considering his previous jaw-dropping endeavors in the \"Mission: Impossible\" films. Those include swinging around the exterior of the world's tallest building, Dubai's Burj Khalifa, in \"Ghost Protocol,\" hanging onto the side of an Airbus A400M mid-flight in \"Rogue Nation,\" and launching himself out of a Boeing C-17 Globemaster III from 25,000 feet, executing a high altitude low opening (HALO) jump on film for the first time ever in \"Fallout.\" This time, after a year of rehearsals in the U.K. during pre-production, Cruise had completed over 500 skydives and 13,000 motocross jumps in preparation.\n\n\"Every time I went off the ramp, it was dangerous. It was risking my life. And we wanted to keep that to a minimum,\" Cruise had previously said. \"We have a saying on 'Mission: Impossible' movies: 'Don't be safe. Be competent.'\"\n\nAn IMAX poster for \"Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One.\" [Photo courtesy of IMAX China]\n\n\"Dead Reckoning Part One\" also marks a significant milestone for the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise. \"This is the first time we've ever split a 'Mission: Impossible' story over two movies. It's something we've never attempted before because of the complexity of these stories. The scale of these two movies is epic in every sense,\" said Cruise. The second installment of \"Dead Reckoning\" is scheduled for June 2024.\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "Mission: Impossibleis a franchise that runs high on expectations not only from audiences but from the man at the helm of the entire series: Tom Cruise.\n\nUnlike franchises likeFast & Furious orJurassic World, the Mission: Impossible films have stayed relatively the same, providing excellent action scenes, beautiful locations, and melancholy character development that leaves Cruise's Ethan Hunt more and more haunted. This consistency is largely credited to writer/director Christopher McQuarrie, who has written and directed the last four Mission: Impossible films.\n\nHowever, McQuarrie wasn't always there to lead the way for Hunt and the Impossible Mission Force. Brain de Palma, the American auteur who mentored Wes Anderson, kicked off the franchise with a gaudy, hyper-stylized, and tension-filled film based on the original TV series. Robert Towne, who wrote Roman Polanski's Chinatown, tossed the original series to the side for a new story that drew in old and new audiences to the cinema. It was a hit, and a sequel was immediately ordered.\n\nWhile John Woo's film is largely forgotten and deemed the weakest entry in the franchise, ScreenRant discovered that Oliver Stone's rejected take on the project was much, much wilder. How wild was it? Let's get into it.\n\n\n\nOliver Stone's Rejected \u200b\u200b'Mission: Impossible' \u200bMovie 'Mission: Impossible II' Paramount Pictures In their Mission: Impossible fan podcastLight The Fuse, host Charles Hood and Drew Taylor go into an in-depth breakdown of an early draft for Stone's planned sequel. Written by David Marconi with revisions by Michael Tolkin, the film saw the return of characters from the first film and an evil supercomputer as the primary villain. The script, which can only be viewed by appointment at the Ron Moore Collection at the Cinematic Arts Library at the University of Southern California, the early Mission: Impossible II outline was disjointed, leaving readers confused as transitions from each act are jarring and unnatural.\n\nMarconi's script opens with a scene that is familiar to Mission: Impossible audiences: during a prison fight, Ethan escapes to Vietnam while following the trail of the movie's antagonist, who seems to be in league with a supercomputer with an appetite for world domination.\n\nThings get stranger as the events of act two play out. At one point, the IMF headquarters in Rome is destroyed and Ethan fakes his own death at an airport in Denver. However, Ethan is then later captured and kept inside an experimental chamber named the Evolution Room where he begins to hallucinate about an escape plan attempted by Luther, which turns out to be an elaborate ploy for information extraction.\n\nEthan ends up hallucinating that he is in the Garden of Eden, where he encounters the Child of the Millennium and debates the nature of reality. Ethan ends up defeating the child, who transforms into a man and then a monster, because of a psychological epiphany that ends the simulation.\n\n\n\nThere is a lot happening in this film that would have been a huge misstep for the narrative established in the first film Yes, Ethan is an insanely impressive secret agent who almost defies the laws of physics to complete his mission, but he is still a man who needs his team. These are films about trust. To throw away that trust in favor of a biblical fight in the mind feels pointless at the end of the day. Would it have been cool to see it? Of course, but that's not what this franchise wanted to be.\n\n\n\nIf we ever get our hands on the script, it would be cool to see where the script shined the brightest and what parts were the ultimate downfall of Stone's and Marconi's screenplay.\n\n\n\nDo you think Oliver Stone's pitch for the second film would have been a success or tanked the blossoming franchise? Let us know in the comments below!\n\n"

    "text": "Paramount Pictures finally released the highly anticipated seventh installment of the Mission: Impossible franchise, and fans loved the most recent look at what Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is doing next. Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One was released to some of the best reviews of the year, and it definitely lives up to the hype. From everything that was released in the trailers, Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One was shaping up to be one of the most action-packed films of the year. As it turns out, the film features a lot of visual effects shots, and that includes the shot of Cruise actually driving a motorcycle off of a mountain. In a new interview with PostPerspective, director Christopher McQuarrie revealed that the film has 2,500 VFX shots.\n\n\"There were 2,500. While Mission is almost entirely practical, there is a great deal of VFX work \u2014 removing camera rigs and safety gear, etc. The underwater submarine shots are entire CGI, which was a very big point of concern for me,\" McQuarrie said. \"I am deeply skeptical of purely CGI shots, particularly when they are the opening and closing shots of the film.Special effects supervisor Alex Wuttke assured me it could be made to work, and I was satisfied with the end result. The shot above the ice at the end of the film is practical, captured when we filmed the Arctic portions of Dead Reckoning Part Two in March of '23, just a few months before completion of Part One.\"\n\n\"With over 2,500 shots, many of which were extremely ambitious, it's hard to pick just one. The motorcycle jump, despite being shot on the first day of principal photography, was one of the very last shots to make final. The shot in the trailer is not the finished product.\" The Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning director added.\n\nWhat Goes Down In Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One?\n\nTom Cruise is back as the iconic action hero Ethan Hunt in the seventh installment, Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One, which is set to make its way into theaters next week. It's the beginning of the end for the action-packed franchise, as Cruise reteams with longtime collaborator and director Christopher McQuarrie for more death-defying and breathtaking stunts. Hunt and allies Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) attempt to track down a new weapon with the power to tear the world apart. Actors Hayley Atwell, Pom Klementieff, and Esai Morales join the cast for the latest installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise, which is set to wrap up with Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part Two.\n\nMission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One is in theaters now with a second part, Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part Two, in production and will hit theaters on June 28, 2024, but could wind up being delayed due to the ongoing WGA strike. Stay tuned to ComicBook.com for more updates on the Mission: Impossible franchise as we learn it!\n\nWhat do you think about Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One?

    "text": "A week later, the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d boom has not abated.\n\nSeven days after Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cBarbie\u201d and Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cOppenheimer\u201d conspired to set box office records, the two films held unusually strongly in theaters. \u201cBarbie\u201d took in a massive $93 million in its second weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.\n\n\u201cBarbie,\u201d the pink-infused pop sensation, has seen remarkably sustained business following its year-best $162 million opening. Its ticket sales dipped only 43%.\n\n\u201cBarbie\u201d has also outpaced Nolan\u2019s \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d to notch the best first two weeks in theaters of any Warner Bros. release. It has rapidly accumulated $351.4 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters, a rate that will soon make it the biggest box office hit of the summer. Every day it\u2019s played, \u201cBarbie\u201d has made at least $20 million.\n\n\u201cOppenheimer,\u201d from Universal Pictures, again landed in second place with an estimated $46.2 million. It, too, held especially strong in its second weekend, with sales decreasing just 44%. Nolan\u2019s three-hour drama starring Cillian Murphy as atomic bomb physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer has accrued $174.1 million thus far.\n\nThis image released by Universal Pictures shows Cillian Murphy in a scene from \u201cOppenheimer.\u201d (Universal Pictures via AP)\n\nWith an additional $72.4 million in international cinemas, \u201cOppenheimer\u201d has already surpassed $400 million globally.\n\nThe week\u2019s top new release, Walt Disney Co.\u2019s \u201cHaunted Mansion,\u201d an adaptation of the Disney theme park attraction, was easily overshadowed by the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d blitz. The film, which cost about $150 million, debuted with $24 million domestically and $9 million in overseas sales.\n\n\u201cHaunted Mansion,\u201d directed by Justin Simien (\u201cDear White People,\u201d \u201cBad Hair\u201d) and starring an ensemble of LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish, Owen Wilson, Danny DeVito and Rosario Dawson, struggled to overcome mediocre reviews.\n\n\u201cTalk to Me,\u201d the A24 supernatural horror film, fared better. It debuted with $10 million. The film, directed by Australian filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou and starring Sophie Wilde, was a midnight premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January and received terrific reviews from critics (95% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes). It was made for a modest $4.5 million.\n\nWhile theaters being flush with moviegoers has been a huge boon to a film industry still recovering ground it lost during the pandemic, it\u2019s been tougher sledding for Tom Cruise, the so-called savior of the movies last summer with \u201cTop Gun: Maverick.\u201d \u201cMission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part I,\u201d starring Cruise and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, grossed $10.7 million in its third weekend. Its domestic total stands at $139.2 million.\n\nInstead, the sleeper hit \u201cSound of Freedom\u201d has been the best performing non-\u201cBarbenheimer\u201d release in theaters. The Angel Studios\u2019 release, which is counting crowdfunding pay-it-forward sales in its box office totals, made $12.4 million in its fourth weekend, bringing its haul thus far to nearly $150 million."

    "text": "It was only supposed to be a meme. And yet, if you made it out to the cinema this weekend \u2013 having most likely pre-booked your tickets, rapidly becoming gold dust as entire picturehouses sold out \u2013 you\u2019ll have seen foyers flooded with people doing the most (seemingly) deranged double-bill of recent memory: Christopher Nolan\u2019s soul-rattling atomic bomb creation story Oppenheimer, and Greta Gerwig\u2019s fuchsia fantasia toy story Barbie. There were pink outfits galore. There were countless discussions of the ideal viewing order. There were celebratory t-shirts designed specifically for the event. And it all came under one ridiculous name: \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019.\n\nThe result has been box office dynamite. Already, Barbie has made $344 million worldwide, with a record-breaking $162 million debut in the States \u2013 giving Greta Gerwig the mantle of highest-grossing opening weekend for a female director. And Oppenheimer \u2013 a three-hour, often black-and-white historical political drama \u2013 was caught up in the chain reaction, earning over $174 million, with IMAX cinemas now sold out weeks in advance. It all adds up to the biggest box office weekend since Avengers: Endgame arrived in 2019, this time split across two non-franchise, non-superhero, non-typical juggernauts.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time a viral trend has made the leap from internet gag to IRL phenomenon \u2013 last year saw Gen Z go wild for \u2018GentleMinions\u2019, where another seemingly ridiculous idea (dress up in your finest suits to celebrate the belated return of those sentient yellow Tic Tacs in Minions: The Rise Of Gru) resulted in major turnouts at the multiplex. \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 began from a similarly \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be funny if\u2026\u2019 notion, when film fans discovered that Nolan\u2019s deeply serious A-bomb biopic was launching on the same day as Gerwig\u2019s deeply unserious plastic-fantastic comedy; the notion of seeing both in quick succession seemed inherently hilarious.\n\nIt went from a notion that was merely pleasantly ridiculous, to pleasantly ridiculous and an absolute must-do.\n\nAnd yet, somewhere along the way, that idea mutated, gained traction. Maybe it was the way the memed designs \u2013 a figure, half-Barbie half-Oppenheimer, donning a hat; \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 written in the Barbie font \u2013 quickly became purchasable items, morphing from a digital running joke into something tangible and real-world, as did the concept of actually seeing both on the same day. Perhaps it was the way that it encroached on the press tour for each film: Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie posed with their Oppenheimer cinema ticket (sparked by Mission: Impossible\u2019s Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise; notably, the trend didn\u2019t become \u2018Barbenheimpossible\u2019), while Christopher Nolan called the notion of doing the double a \u201cgreat\u201d one. Like Margot Robbie\u2019s Barbie herself \u2013 and, for that matter, Oppenheimer\u2019s atomic bomb \u2013 what began as a mere idea soon became real.\n\nSurely contributing to the \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 blowout is that both films received excellent reviews \u2013 after weeks of omnipresent Barbie marketing, a thunderous Oppenheimer campaign, and all the accompanying Barben-hype, the critical consensus for both Gerwig and Nolan\u2019s films was rapturously positive. And while strong reviews don\u2019t always equal strong box office, it had a catalytic effect here \u2013 evolving the conversation once more from the notion that you could watch both in a day, to the idea that you should; that each film stands as a triumph from a distinctive directorial voice, and that for all their seeming differences, to watch both back-to-back would mean seeing two of the best movies of the year across one single super-sized, super-cinematic outing. It went from a notion that was merely pleasantly ridiculous, to pleasantly ridiculous and an absolute must-do.\n\nAs the idea snowballed \u2013 the realisation that people really were going to see both spurring others on to do the same \u2013 it soon became clear that Barbie and Oppenheimer make for a surprisingly great double bill. The Day-Glo colours and wacky comedy of Barbie and the intense atmosphere of doom of Oppenheimer don\u2019t just weirdly complement each other; in Gerwig\u2019s (and co-writer Noah Baumbach\u2019s) hands, Barbie itself contrasts its gleaming surfaces with deep explorations of existential ideas. They are both, oddly, about reckoning with our purpose in life; about interrogating the (destructive) role of men in society; about bridging the chasm between ideas and reality. Just, one does it with neon rollerblades and a Dua Lipa disco track. And they\u2019re both big-screen must-sees \u2013 distinctive examples of impeccable filmmaking craft, delivering undeniable cinematic spectacle in a different way to the usual fight sequences of a summer blockbuster.\n\nThe cumulative effect of Barbenheimer created the very thing that Hollywood has perhaps struggled to conjure in recent years: the sense of an all-out cinematic event. It was one that people actively wanted to be part of: to contribute to the conversation of whether you\u2019d seen one, or both; to share stories of how busy it was in the cinema; to see the most-hyped releases of the year in packed houses, all laughing together at Barbie\u2019s most uproarious jokes, or in a shared sense of deep terror at Oppenheimer\u2019s bomb blast. You really did have to be there \u2013 of everything to do in the world this weekend, being at your local cinema was the #1 destination. It\u2019s a rare but wonderful occurrence, most recently felt with Endgame\u2019s \u2018see it before anyone else spoils it\u2019 excitement, or Parasite\u2019s \u2018no, this is really one of the best and most enthralling thrillers you\u2019ll have seen in years\u2019 dismantling of the one-inch-tall subtitle barrier (as director Bong Joon-Ho put it).\n\nAnd that\u2019s where cinemas have really won this weekend: whether driven by memes, by reviews, or by a simple desire to be involved, people have flocked to their local movie-houses this weekend, and probably had their best experience there in years. The lessons Hollywood takes from it remain to be seen \u2013 a Barbenheimer likely can\u2019t be manufactured, nor is it a simple case of counter-programming, nor necessarily a signal that audiences want more movies based on historic toy brands or, um, weapons of mass destruction. Perhaps it\u2019s a sign that sequels aren\u2019t the be-all and end-all anymore. Perhaps it\u2019s an indication that allowing talented filmmakers to take major risks and marketing them properly is the way forward. Perhaps people just wanted to wear pink and have fun \u2013 and who can blame them? But for whatever reason audiences entered their Barbie and Oppenheimer screenings, they likely left with a greater appreciation of the cinema experience. Your move, Hollywood."
