In the movie, a Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) living in Barbie Land begins malfunctioning. So she heads to the real world with her companion Ken (Ryan Gosling) to figure out how to fix herself.\n\nDespite the fact that the doll is marketed to children, the movie seems to be trying to appeal to older audiences who have memories of growing up with Barbie. Plus, The Motion Picture Association has given \"Barbie\" a rating of PG-13 for suggestive references and brief language, meaning that it's not entirely kid-friendly.\n\nHere's everything we know about the film, so you can decide if your child should see \"Barbie.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are three swear words used in the movie, but one is bleeped out.\n\nRyan Gosling and Margot Robbie as Ken and Barbie in \"Barbie.\" Courtesy of Warner Bros.\n\nThe MPA's rating is mainly focused on the brief strong language and suggestive references in the movie. Throughout the movie, there are a few sexual innuendos.\n\nIn one scene that can be seen in the trailer, Ken asks to stay over at Barbie's house. \"To do what?\" she asks, to which he says, \"I'm really not sure.\"\n\nIn another scene, Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) makes a joke about the \"smooth blob\" Ken is \"packing in those shorts.\"\n\nMost of these jokes will likely go over children's heads.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are also a few scenes where mild adult language — words like \"bitch\" and \"crap\" — is used. In a major scene, the word \"motherfucker\" is also bleeped out for laughs.\n\nThere is mild violence, but it's often used for laughs.\n\nKingsley Ben-Adir, Ryan Gosling and Ncuti Gatwa as Kens in \"Barbie.\" Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nThere are also a few scenes with mildly violent fights. In the trailer, we see Barbie punch a human for touching her body without permission. In another scene, seen in the trailer, we see all the Kens fighting each other.\n\nHowever, the Kens in the battle scene specifically do not use real weapons and the battle comes off more as a joke than as a show of violence.\n\nThe movie features heavy themes about gender inequality and death, which parents may want to discuss with their children.\n\nMargot Robbie as Barbie in \"Barbie.\" Jaap Buitendijk/Warner Bros.\n\nThe movie raises many questions about death and the purpose of life, which may be subjects that parents want to discuss with their children before or after they see the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs seen in the trailer, Barbie asks her fellow dolls if they've ever thought about dying. This is a catalyst for Barbie's journey and a key theme as she learns about the real world and mortality.\n\nGender inequality and the impact of the patriarchy are other key themes within \"Barbie,\" especially when the dolls journey into the real world. This may also prompt questions from younger children.\n\nWhile children's films actually do sometimes address death (see: last year's hit movie, \"Puss In Boots: The Last Wish,\") \"Barbie\" presents this theme more philosophically and existentially, where it's more likely to prompt questions from your child.\n\n\"Barbie\" is in theaters now."

        "text": "Like it or not, we are all citizens of the state of Barbieland – or at least we were on the eve of Barbie’s opening.\n\nFollowing a year-long wink-wink, think-pink marketing blitz that shaded every corner of the public consciousness in Pantone 219C, masses of film and pop culture devotees squeezed into their rosiest garments and headed to the cinema to see writer-director Greta Gerwig’s sparkly tribute to the wasp-waisted Mattel doll. Made in conjunction with the Los Angeles-based toy brand, Barbie is the first of 45 Mattel IP productions in the works.\n\nThe film, which stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling and whose production budget is $145m, is expected to capture at least $90m in domestic ticket sales over the weekend, jolting the soft box office revenue of late. The film shares an opening date with another summer tentpole, Christopher Nolan’s atomic bomb drama Oppenheimer. Projections for the Barbie rival’s first weekend showing are less explosive, with expectations between $40m and $60m.\n\nA contingent of pop culture obsessives have made sedentary sport of the double feature, and plenty of TikTokers have opinions on the correct way to do “Barbenheimer” (save the sweet treat for last is the general consensus). The theater chain AMC reported that more than 40,000 people had purchased tickets to see Barbie and Oppenheimer on 21 July.\n\n“I can’t remember the last time I bought a ticket this far in advance,” said Hannah Jegart, a 33-year-old producer at a design agency who secured her Barbie seat two weeks before Thursday’s sneak previews. “I just want to feel unadulterated joy,” the film lover said of what she hoped would be a “silly and campy afternoon”. Hours before showtime, she was already feeling nostalgic for the kind of event entertainment that has been so lacking in recent years. “And with the writers’ and actors’ strike, this is probably the last Barbie-level movie for the next while.”\n\nMembers of the public dressed up for the opening night of Barbie in New York. Photograph: Lauren Mechling/The Guardian\n\n“I’ve been waiting for this for two years,” said Madeline Warshaw, 27, a design strategist who lives in Philadelphia. “I’ve been dying to go to a movie theater and have something that feels like a monoculture event.” The design strategist grew up playing with Barbie dolls and has been a Gerwig super-fan for her entire adult life. “I feel like the stars are aligning.” After the screening, Warshaw’s group of four headed over to her apartment to feast on a cake that she had baked and decorated with a mess of rainbow sprinkles and an actual Barbie doll.\n\n“Margot Robbie’s hair looks like whipped cream,” marveled Brooklyn resident Elena Mehlman. The 27-year-old said her commitment to putting on lavender checkered pedal pushers and seeing Barbie on opening night is about more than entertainment. “I believe in voting with my dollars,” she said, citing her desire for Barbie to win the box-office war against Oppenheimer. “Even though there’s a sense that women have a big voice in creative spaces, that’s not true,” Mehlman said. “A film directed by a woman and with a woman in the lead deserves all the support it can get.”\n\n“The cast list is so crazy it’s fun,” said another New Yorker, Arianna Mastro, who made a point of reserving her opening night spots at a theater near the Malibu Barbie Cafe in downtown Manhattan. A pre-showtime swing-by at the pop-up saw about two-thirds of the tables occupied, mostly by women wearing pink spaghetti strap dresses and feasting on California Dreamin’ club sandwiches. Also in pink was a young girl by the door, sobbing. It was her fifth birthday but the restaurant wouldn’t seat her family because they had failed to make a reservation. “You can’t just sit down and order off the menu,” a host told the Guardian. “Everything has to be selected in advance.”\n\nA trio of high-schoolers in Barbie Cosplay had better things to say about the restaurant. “The Paradise Rainbow pancakes were really good,” said Tee Compton, 17, wearing a pink A-line dress and matching bobby socks. She and her friends, who live in New Jersey, had made a two-day event of the Barbie release. They had tickets for a matinee screening the following day, and planned to wear darker versions of their outfits. “It’s something fun to do,” said Compton.\n\nMargot Robbie in Barbie. Photograph: FlixPix/Alamy\n\nFurther uptown, at the AMC theater in Times Square, there were no fewer than 28 Barbie screenings taking place between the window of 6.15pm and 12.30am. (Oppenheimer was also showing, but in fewer theaters.) Dressed in varying degrees of commitment (one woman’s fuschia sweatshirt draped over an arm is another woman’s pink bandage dress and heels), ticket-holders filtered in and reported to their assigned seats. Some stopped along the way to purchase a popcorn-filled plastic Corvette souvenir and doll combo for $64.95.\n\nMorgan Staley, a professional dog walker wearing pink cat eye glasses, was waiting at the entrance for her friend, a man who she called a Barbie obsessive. “I’m mostly here for emotional support,” she said. “But I do love Margot Robbie.”\n\nThe energy in a 7.30 screening room, filled to near capacity, started off at a high pitch. There was a note of determination to the laughter that broke out when the Mattel logo flashed on the screen. Then came rapturous cries of “Hi Barbie!” as everyone waited for the first actor to appear. Over the next hour and 54 minutes, the audience’s mood took a turn for the less forced. It was Barbie’s turn to do the work. When the house lights came back on, a woman in the front row didn’t budge. She had sunk deep into her seat and appeared to be in a state of unadulterated bliss, her pink kitten heels kicked off to the side."

        "text": "London-based personal trainer David Higgins has been working with Margot Robbie since about 2015, when she was first prepping for her role in \"The Legend of Tarzan.\" The aesthetic of that move — that is, tousled, grungy, raw — is just about the antithesis of her of-the-moment starring role in \"Barbie.\" Still, to prep for the perfectly pink, manicured role of Barbie, Robbie went back to Higgins, this time asking him not only to train her, but also the entire cast — both the Barbies and the Kens. (She got the rec, in case you were curious, from none other than Samuel L. Jackson.) What followed was just about as wholesome as it gets: the whole cast would turn up for workouts with Higgins during their summer shooting schedule in London, and it became like \"a community,\" Higgins tells POPSUGAR. \"It was a really collaborative, fun experience,\" he says, with even director Greta Gerwig and other producers coming in.\n\n\"The gym environment effectively fed into the film; it was fun and everyone was just up for a laugh and to feel good.\"\n\n\"The gym environment effectively fed into the film; it was fun and everyone was just up for a laugh and to feel good. It wasn't aesthetics,\" Higgins says. \"I always find that the aesthetics come naturally when you're working out properly and you're looking after your diet, but it wasn't ever the focus. It was more of a team-building, community experience . . . it wasn't like the superhero movies that I usually work on, where [the goal] is very specific, like, let's create these superhero bodies. Barbie was more about: let's just feel good, and if you feel good, that's going to translate on camera.\" If you had to guess what type of workouts would comprise the \"Barbie\" method of training, you might say . . . step aerobics? And that's not far off, considering Gerwig herself is a certified step-aerobics instructor. But the reality is even more obvious, considering it's the hottest workout right now: Pilates. Higgins, who's also a physical therapist, has been marrying Pilates with traditional strength and conditioning training — in the world of fitness, a surprisingly unlikely pair — for about 20 years now. As a PT, he comes at exercise from a rehabilitation perspective. He realized he \"really enjoyed the majority of what Pilates was about, which was control, engagement, and correct alignment,\" he says. But instead of going full-on Pilates, Higgins thought: \"Why don't you learn how to do it all? And you can, because the body responds significantly well to diversity.\" This hybrid approach forms the basis of the Barbie method — a name he hasn't personally given the workout style, but which seems fitting when referencing his training of the movie's cast — and it seems like a great method for anyone, life in plastic or otherwise. Here, peek behind the curtain at the Barbie cast's training sessions, and even try a workout for yourself."

        "text": "The fact is, it’ll be nearly impossible for Barbie to live up to its hype. Just as perfection only exists as an ideal never quite made flesh, Greta Gerwig’s desperately anticipated film based on the blonde plastic doll will necessarily disappoint some when the fantasy of its stunning promotion gives way to the reality of seeing the actual movie. That’s the double-edged sword of so much frenzied buzz.\n\nA kind of mob hysteria has taken hold of us in the past few months: the people are demanding cinematic Barbie — the version artfully masterminded by an esteemed auteur director, starring two beautiful and seriously regarded actors. But of course, Barbie fever is in many ways manufactured mania, with the backing of a Hollywood blockbuster marketing budget. Barbie’s total marketing spend hasn’t been confirmed, but it’s not uncommon for big studios to fork over $100 million or more on major releases (according to Deadline, global marketing for The Little Mermaid cost around $140 million.) After a few extremely shaky years for moviegoing, studios are ramping up to blowout ad campaigns again.\n\nThe biggest stars of Barbie arguably aren’t Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken but the movie’s uncanny marketing team, which has worked overtime to ensure the doll, movie, and brand are inescapable this summer. They’ve acquired an almost mythic stature, spawning memes and parodies of their terrifying prowess. Never mind all the traditional advertising you might see on the street or on TV, as well as the magazine covers, talk show interviews, and Margot Robbie’s to-die-for red carpet outfits that come with a press tour (a tour, however, that has been interrupted by the WGA/SAG-AFTRA double strike). No, this Barbie is all about securing brand deals.\n\nThe amount of Barbie film branded merch is pretty mind-numbing. You could build an entire closet out of them: A collection with Gap, Barbie x Bloomingdales, hot pink roller suitcases with luxury luggage brand Beis, a capsule collection with sneaker brand Superga, more makeup and skin care sets than we’re willing to count, accessories with Fossil, even a full-on assortment of clothes and accessories at Hot Topic, which has in recent years become a bastion for feeding fandom obsession and millennial nostalgia. (Also important to note that Trisha Paytas did a haul vid of every Hot Topic x Barbie piece). Furniture brand Joybird has a slate of Barbie Dreamhouse-inspired seating to adorn your home. In Brazil, there’s even a limited-edition Barbie cheeseburger from Burger King that’s dressed with a disturbingly pink sauce.\n\nThere were some standout moments, like the blindingly neon Barbie rollerblades from Impala Skate, which went viral after the set photos leaked. An army of rollerbladers wearing those exact skates promoted the movie at New York City Pride this year. Or take the surprise reveal of a Barbie Dreamhouse in Malibu, bookable on Airbnb. There’s a Barbie Xbox that looks like a little dollhouse (though, personally, a Barbie-pink edition of the Nintendo Switch would have been way more enticing). If your brand exists in 2023, chances are you did some kind of Barbie collab: a Bumble event featuring online dating tips from Barbie and Ken; a Progressive Insurance commercial set in the Barbieverse; a redesigned Roku City featuring Barbie’s Dreamhouse and a movie theater marquee advertising the film. A Barbie selfie generator went somewhat viral a few months back. Google any keywords related to the film right now, and watch the search engine’s typically staid colors turn pink, with pink sparkles raining down the screen.\n\nWhat stands out for brand strategist Moshe Isaacian is how much of the promo around the film has savvily drawn on “what makes Barbie and the movie iconic,” he tells Vox — such as the rollerblades. In a viral Twitter thread listing Barbie’s copious brand tie-ins, Isaacian noted, “The devil works hard, but @Barbie’s marketing team is INSANE.”\n\nBut all that hustle seems poised to pay off. National Research Group, which releases box office projections, is now expecting Barbie to make $110 million in its opening weekend. (Meanwhile, rival Oppenheimer’s projections are a more modest $49 million.) To compare that with other blockbuster openers, Top Gun: Maverick banked $124 million in its domestic opening weekend. Over $100 million in the first three days is pretty impressive for a film about a popular child’s toy that’s aimed at adults — though we do live in a world where the Super Mario Bros. movie destroyed box office records. Not unlike Barbie, Super Mario Bros. also snared a lot of brand deals in the lead-up to its release: a mushroom-heavy Shake Shack menu and a line of body care products with Lush Cosmetic, just to name two.\n\nIsaacian says that such quirky, at times outlandish brand tie-ins are a callback to how big and bold movie marketing was in the ’90s — like the now-coveted McDonald’s Szechuan sauce, which was originally released to promote Disney’s Mulan. “What we’re seeing [that’s] different is that with Barbie, it’s not about getting all this movie marketing to sell Barbie toys,” says Isaacian. “It’s to bring what Barbie stands for to our real world.”\n\n“It’s been appealing to the gamers, it’s been appealing for people who like collecting stuff for their home, people who love skating, and shoes,” he continued. That’s a large part of the appeal — the world of Barbie has always been hyper-surreal fantasy. A doll living in a perfect world, who jumps from career to career with no barriers in her way and a million friends by her side. A doll whose feet literally never quite touch the ground. With each new piece of Barbie promo, we’re asked to imagine, what if it were all real and possible? Wouldn’t la vie en rose be so delightful?\n\nGerwig’s Barbie, with its tongue-in-cheek tone and PG-13 rating, is not for young children. It’s camp that promises to hit hardest for adults of a certain generation — with a cast that includes Helen Mirren, Will Ferrell, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, Michael Cera, and Rhea Perlman.\n\nBeyond the tangible Barbie logo stuff stans can buy, much of the promo has targeted a kind of digital culture cachet — catnip for adults who keep tabs on art, design, and whatever the latest vibe shift is. Of course there was an Architectural Digest tour of Barbie’s house. The alleged discovery of Margot Robbie’s secret Letterboxd list of films to watch for Barbie (with the likes of Jacques Demy’s The Umbrellas of Cherbourg appearing on it) set cinephiles trembling. Recently, Gerwig did an actual interview with Letterboxd of her “official Barbie watchlist” (it did in fact include Umbrellas). The very fact that it’s a project helmed by Gerwig — whose past work includes Little Women, Lady Bird, Frances Ha — with a screenplay co-written with Noah Baumbach, was an absurd enough premise to draw an audience in. With their names attached, there’s been a permeating sense that the film is bound to be subversive, boundary-breaking, a technicolor acid trip. Axios reports that almost half a million Barbie pieces have been published in 2023 — reports, essays, takes, odes to all that Barbie means in the culture — like this Artsy deep dive into the film’s “hyperfeminine” kitsch. Tumblr and Instagram accounts dedicated to aesthetic film stills will be eating good off Gerwig’s Barbie for decades.\n\nIt’s also coming at more or less the right time, in the post-bimbo wave of pop culture theory, which says that there’s actually no need to choose between hyperfemininity, in whatever forms we typically conceive of it (like, for example, wearing a lot of pink) and being taken seriously as a smart, competent person — that was always an illusory choice anyway. Meanwhile, the platonic ideal of a man is pretty much Ken, a himbo who displays an unpracticed wisdom, and impeccable taste, through his total awe and adoration of the Barbie in his life. You see, he’s the polar opposite of a dude who’ll smugly observe that you’re not like the other girls. A few years earlier, and Gerwig’s Barbie might not have seemed so cool; a few years later, it could have felt extremely stale.\n\nAnd then there are the memes. Barbie fever isn’t just driven by nostalgia or Gerwig heads or the prospect of a big theater-worthy event to look forward to after the lean pandemic years. Hype itself is the energizing pleasure, a wink and nod that you’re in on the joke. The biggest catalyst, without a doubt, is the fortuitous fact that Christopher Nolan’s gritty biopic Oppenheimer, about the man who created the atomic bomb, is opening on the same day as Barbie. On social media, there’s been joke after joke about the movie’s made-up rivalry. People are arguing about the correct itinerary for what amounts to summiting Mount Everest in terms of moviegoing this summer: the Barbie-Oppenheimer Double Feature. We have to ask ourselves, would Barbie thirst as we know it today exist without Oppenheimer? If the Extremely Online writers and meme purveyors weren’t so tickled by the situational irony of it?\n\nTo be clear, the online memes have spilled over into the real world. Barbie’s virality has taken on a life of its own, growing into a self-sustaining creature that no marketing team on Earth could predict or wrangle. I actually don’t know many people are clamoring to buy Barbie merch — but, according to AMC, over 40,000 people have bought tickets to both Barbie and Oppenheimer this weekend (somewhere in the world, Nicole Kidman is beaming with pride). I went to a Barbie-themed birthday party last weekend, the first in my life, adult or child. A few weeks ago at the Soho REI store, among the Camelbaks and carabiners, employees were conducting a poll asking customers whether they were seeing Barbie or Oppenheimer first. (An REI spokesperson confirmed that the company wasn’t a part of either film’s marketing campaigns.)\n\nWe’ve talked each other’s ears off about the movie for free — a thing that no marketing strategy, no matter how savvy or well-funded, could buy. The real Barbie (2023) was all the friends we made along the way."

        "text": "Barbie fervor has taken over the nation recently, but here at 1 Up in Orlando, there is a designated place to celebrate the release of the new movie.\n\nFrom Barbie’s kitchen to her couch, to her bathtub, 1 Up has it all. The arcade has an upstairs section dedicated entirely to Barbie.\n\nThat discovery has been the delight of Instagrammers and Barbie fans all over Orlando. Blair Hurley came with a group of friends to celebrate the movie release at 1 Up.\n\n\"What Barbie means to me is that as a girl, we can do anything,\" said Hurley.\n\nFor 1 Up Bar Manager Luke Horman, the best part is that the Barbie section of the arcade happened to already be there. The bar crafted special drinks for the movie release, and made sure to have plenty of people in costume, but didn’t have to add any new furniture.\n\n\"We’ve got a really good, Instagrammable place,\" said Horman. Memories as well – if you grew up on Barbie, you come in here, you’re like, ‘I remember a lot of this stuff.’\"\n\nBut that isn’t Central Florida’s only Barbie connection. A local named Ashely Young plays \"Bionic Barbie\" in the movie.\n\n\"They reached out to me saying the Barbie movie was looking for a dancer with a limb difference, and wondering if I wanted to come in and audition,\" she recounted. \"I was like, ‘Yeah, absolutely.’\"\n\nYoung was born without the lower half of her right arm.\n\nShe says on top of an amazing experience with the cast, crew, and set – she’s grateful that other people with limb differences will be able to see themselves in the movie.\n\n\"Growing up, I didn’t have any sort of role models or any kind of dolls that looked like me, so hopefully this next generation of kids with limb differences, amputees, they can see me in this movie and think this is possible for them as well,\" said Young. \"At the end, when we wrapped up filming, I think it finally hit me what sort of impact this is going to have. I just broke down and cried – a bunch of people hugged me in the makeup tent.\"\n\nWith Barbie clocking in so far as the second-biggest release of the year, and a Rotten Tomatoes score hovering around 90%, you can expect to see plenty of pink for a while longer.\n\nSteffani Ouano, another member of a group dressed up for the Barbie movie release has this advice:\n\n\"Be pink, be extra, just have fun. And be a great role model, because that’s what Barbie is.\"\n\n1 Up says they typically do different events every single Friday, but they said if the Barbie one turns out to be a hit, they might bring it back."

        "text": "There’s a new angle in the summer face-off between Oppenheimer and Barbie. It’s over which of the two movies is more politically controversial. The odd thing is, Barbie might win.\n\nWhat might tilt the competition is a single shot in the film, lasting just a few seconds. It occurs when Barbie looks at a map of the real world. Barely visible on the map—but flashing like neon strobe lights to some viewers—is a dotted line in the middle of a sea. The government of Vietnam took that to be the infamous “nine-dash line” that the People’s Republic of China draws on its official maps to denote the maritime border in the South China Sea—a border that Vietnam, most other Asian countries, and the United States fiercely contest. As a result, Vietnam’s government banned the movie.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz careened into the squabble, denouncing the movie as “Chinese Communist propaganda.” Rep. Mike Gallagher, chairman of the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, didn’t go quite that far but claimed that the map “illustrates the pressure that Hollywood is under the please [Chinese Communist Party] censors.”\n\nAs the characters in a Coen brothers movie might say: What’s the rumpus?\n\nFor well over a decade, Hollywood studios have taken great care not to offend China in any way whatsoever, lest their products be banned from the lucrative Chinese market. Some of the resulting instances of self-censorship have hovered between appalling and hilarious.\n\nRelated From Slate The Correct Order in Which to See Barbie and Oppenheimer Read More\n\nIn 2012 MGM remade Red Dawn, a 1984 movie about a Soviet invasion of the United States. By the time of the reboot, U.S.–Russia relations had settled into the post–Cold War reset, so the enemy was recast as China. But studio execs, worried about losing the China market, ordered the script to be rewritten to paint the invaders as swarms of North Koreans—a completely preposterous premise. (The movie still grossed $65 million.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFear of losing revenue is why Disney added a panda bear to the Chinese version of Zootopia; why Disney and Marvel together changed the ethnicity of the spiritual leader in Doctor Strange from Tibetan to Caucasian; why—as Emily Nussbaum reported in the New Yorker a few years ago—CBS censored a scene from The Good Fight that satirized Hollywood’s pandering to Beijing; why you almost never see any harsh reference to China in any American film or TV show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe flap over the Barbie map is almost a self-parody of cultural politics. The film’s studio, Warner Bros., issued a statement, insisting, “The map in Barbie Land is a whimsical, child-like crayon drawing. … It was not intended to make any type of statement.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn one sense, the studio is clearly correct. The map is an imaginary hodgepodge. The countries and seas look nothing like real countries or seas. The vague maritime border line has just eight dashes, not nine. This may be why the Philippine government, which at first followed Vietnam’s suit in banning the film, retracted the ban upon closer scrutiny.\n\nStill, Stanley Rosen, a professor of political science at the University of Southern California who has written extensively about China and pop culture, told me in a phone conversation, “It’s strange that the map has any dashed lines at all.” He speculated that Warner Bros.—which has huge investments in China—is “trying to have it both ways: kowtowing to China by drawing the dashed lines but keeping plausible deniability by drawing them in an imaginary map.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are a few signs, however, that at least some in Hollywood are growing less fearful of Beijing’s cultural dictates. Ever since 2017, when then-President Donald Trump launched his trade war, the China market has diminished in importance. In the spring of that year, Screen Daily reported that China’s once-bottomless well of resources for foreign entertainment had “slowed to a trickle.” Wang Jianlin, head of the Dalian Wanda Group, a major Chinese media firm who once nourished dreams of conquering Hollywood, had “his wings clipped” after Chairman Xi Jinping ordered corporations to reduce their debt. Huahua Media and the Shanghai Film Group backed out of a $1 billion financial deal that they had signed with Paramount just a few months earlier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, each side has learned that the other might not be as vital as it once was. COVID shut down movie theaters in both countries. Once they reopened, Beijing’s cultural ministers discovered that Chinese-made movies did very well at the box office. Meanwhile, some Hollywood blockbusters did spectacularly well without earnings from China at all. In the most notorious case, Paramount digitally altered a scene in Top Gun: Maverick showing a patch of Taiwan’s flag on Tom Cruise’s flight jacket. When fans protested, the company restored the image. As a result, Beijing banned the film. But it has grossed more than $1 billion worldwide anyway.\n\nRosen told me that, even for big-budget movie franchises that haven’t been banned, ticket sales in China have been “much less strong” for more recent films than they were for earlier ones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking at those numbers (a cultural aspect of the broad “de-risking” in U.S.–China trade relations), some studio executives are beginning to ignore or defy Beijing’s cultural dictates.\n\nIn 2019 The Laundromat, a Netflix film made by Steven Soderbergh about the international financial scandals revealed in the Panama Papers, featured a whole segment about scandals involving Chinese state-owned companies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis year, in the first few episodes of The Blacklist’s 10th and final season, the bad guy was a Chinese criminal who, according to the plotline, worked with officials in the consulate of the People’s Republic of China in New York. As a fan of the show, I was startled by this—as was Rosen. The character had been featured in the show’s first season. But, Rosen said, “bringing the Chinese consulate into the plot goes a step beyond what had been done before.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was particularly surprising because NBC’s parent company, Universal Pictures, which aired the show, has a huge theme park in Beijing and has co-produced about 50 films with China’s Perfect World Pictures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNonetheless, John Eisendrath, a writer and executive producer of The Blacklist, told me in a phone conversation that the studio raised no complaints about these or any other episodes. “I think China has become less and less important as a market, and as a result, there might be less inclination to follow their rules,” he said.\n\nAnd so we may see more of this indifference to Chinese sensitivities—because of not just loosening financial ties with Beijing but tightening political pressures at home. In April, Rep. Gallagher, whose House committee stands as a bipartisan funnel of Beijing bashing, met with some Hollywood leaders, including Disney’s Bob Iger, and, according to one knowledgeable source, “gave them an earful” on their China groveling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill the next reboot of Red Dawn portray air and naval battles in the Taiwan Strait? Will the new James Bond go after a rogue villain on one of the militarized islands in the South China Sea? Will Keanu Reeves (whose John Wick 4 was banned in China because he attended a concert to aid Tibet) be allowed to make a movie about the Dalai Lama or Uyghur internment camps?\n\nProbably not. China isn’t as big a market for the studios as it used to be, but it’s still very big. It will be interesting to see what the map’s eight-dash line in Barbie looks like—and whether the studio thinks any changes might be warranted—when the movie comes out in Blu-ray."

Then make others weaker with a Q-tip. This makes them 3D and dimensional, rather than all the same strength in color.\" Freckles should go on first, so any product you use shouldn't smudge when you put the rest of your makeup on, said Primorac. Try Rimmel Scandaleyes Exaggerate Eye Definer in Chocolate Brown or Charlotte Tilbury The Feline Flick in Super Brown , both of which have great staying power.

        "text": "New York CNN —\n\nIt’s a tale of two movies and a box office triumph: “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” maintained incredible momentum into their second weekends.\n\n“Barbie” wore several hats this weekend, with domestic “Barbie” impressing with $93 million in gross revenue and international “Barbie” bringing in around $122 million, making it the No. 1 release worldwide.\n\nIt is the largest domestic second weekend performance ever for Warner Bros., which distributed the movie. (CNN and Warner Bros. are both owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n\n“Oppenheimer” also had a blowout weekend, with a domestic total of $46 million, according to estimates from media analytics company Comscore, bringing its worldwide total to almost half a billion dollars. Universal, which distributed the movie, estimated Oppenheimer will be Nolan’s biggest non-superhero film of all-time in 40 regions, and his biggest film ever in 28.\n\nCrucially, these numbers reflect that not only is there high energy and excitement for movies, but an appetite for the movie theater experience.\n\nPeople dress up as the doll Barbie to attend the Barbie movie on July 21, 2023 in New York City. Stephanie Keith/Getty Images\n\n“Barbenheimer was never going to happen on your TV, it’s just not,” said Michael O’Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of Theater Owners in the United States. “You have to go into the theater to experience it.”\n\nRepeat viewings are also fueling box office earnings. Midwest-based chain B&B Theaters estimated that across its 55 theaters, more than 2,100 people saw “Barbie” both opening weekend and this weekend, and almost 500 returned to see “Oppenheimer.”\n\n“Hollywood” is often considered interchangeable with “the movie industry,” and O’Leary notes that there has always been a strong movie theater culture in the United States.\n\nAfter the pandemic ravaged theaters and public screenings, people are now looking forward to “sitting in a theater with world-class projection and sound systems, having an immersive experience alongside other people,” he said.\n\n“Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” will trigger more and more people going to the movies by reminding them “the best of what the theatrical experience can be. It’s a reawakening,” he added.\n\nA fake doctor's note posted by movie theater chain B&B Theaters, excusing theatergoers from other commitments until they've seen both \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" on July 21, 2023. bbtheatres/Instagram\n\nO’Leary expects the movies to perform well for weeks to come, noting there’s been a rise over the past several years in very strong holdover weekends. That could be partly due to energetic word-of-mouth stoked by social media.\n\n“At their core, consumers want to go see a compelling story, they want to be entertained,” he said. “If stories resonate with people… they tell other people.”\n\nThe overwhelming appreciation for these creative projects means that the ongoing Writers Guild of America and actors union SAG-AFTRA strikes could be a dark cloud over the these financial successes, according to some analysts.\n\n“There’s pressure to resolve (these labor disputes) because the possibility of revenue is built on the foundation of having movies and actors to promote them,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. “For now we have high-profile films, but that pool will be drying out.”\n\nWriters Guild of America and Screen Actors Guild members with supporters on a picket line outside Fox Studios in Los Angeles on July 21, 2023. Eric Thayer/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe production limbo caused by a lack of negotiations on the part of studios are leading to a ripple effect where the release dates for those projects will also be postponed. According to Boxoffice Pro chief analyst Shawn Robbins, this means that in the second half of 2023 and throughout 2024, theater chains will need “to keep a weather eye on the horizon for problems beyond their control.”\n\n“While it’s important to celebrate the good times right now and realize they can be a barometer for the future, it’s just as important to recognize the fight for equality by so many who play a part in creating the content we see on our screens, large and small,” he added."

        "text": "The Warner Bros. Film Group in the U.S. has made a public apology about social media activity concerning the “Barbenheimer” meme that has caused major offence in Japan.\n\n“Warner Brothers regrets its recent insensitive social media engagement. The studio offers a sincere apology,” the company said in a statement emailed to Variety on Tuesday.\n\nThe move follows criticism of Warner by members of the public in Japan, the start of an online petition against the studio and an unusual maneuver by the Japanese distribution arm of Warner.\n\nWarner Bros. Japan on Monday posted a statement on its official Japanese-language “Barbie” Twitter account criticizing the studio’s U.S. branch for feeding into the “Barbenheimer” craze on social media. The “Barbie” U.S. Twitter account has positively interacted with some fan posts about “Barbenheimer,” which refers to the dual summer releases of Universal’s “Oppenheimer” and Warner Bros.’ “Barbie” movies. Both movies were released on July 21 in North America and many international territories and became box office juggernauts. Together, they boosted the box office to its fourth highest-grossing weekend in history during their debut outings.\n\n“Oppenheimer” has not been released in Japan and no release date has yet been determined. While the film debates the issue of whether the bombings ultimately saved lives and brought international peace, the latest skirmish underlines the continuing sensitivity of the nuclear weapons debate in Japan. By some estimates, as many as 250,000 people were killed by the two atomic bombs dropped by the U.S. on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.\n\n“We consider it extremely regrettable that the official account of the American headquarters for the movie ‘Barbie’ reacted to the social media postings of ‘Barbenheimer’ fans,” Warner Bros. Japan wrote in a statement published on the “Barbie” Japan Twitter profile. “We take this situation very seriously. We are asking the U.S. headquarters to take appropriate action. We apologize to those who were offended by this series of inconsiderate reactions. Warner Bros Japan.”\n\nResponding to one “Barbenheimer” fan art poster which depicts Margot Robbie’s Barbie sitting on the shoulders of Cillian Murphy’s J. Robert Oppenheimer in front of a fiery atomic mushroom cloud, the “Barbie” U.S. Twitter account wrote, “It’s going to be a summer to remember.” Twitter, now called X, added a community note to the post explaining the historical context of the mushroom cloud image.\n\n“At 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945 (Showa 20), an atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima for the first time in human history,” the Twitter note reads. “The particular nature of the damage caused by the atomic bombs is that mass destruction and mass murder occurred instantaneously and indiscriminately.”\n\nThe “Barbenheimer” craze has drawn criticism in Japan for making light of the mass destruction caused by the atomic bombs. The hashtag #NoBarbenheimer has trended in the country in recent days."

        "text": "It was only supposed to be a meme. And yet, if you made it out to the cinema this weekend – having most likely pre-booked your tickets, rapidly becoming gold dust as entire picturehouses sold out – you’ll have seen foyers flooded with people doing the most (seemingly) deranged double-bill of recent memory: Christopher Nolan’s soul-rattling atomic bomb creation story Oppenheimer, and Greta Gerwig’s fuchsia fantasia toy story Barbie. There were pink outfits galore. There were countless discussions of the ideal viewing order. There were celebratory t-shirts designed specifically for the event. And it all came under one ridiculous name: ‘Barbenheimer’.\n\nThe result has been box office dynamite. Already, Barbie has made $344 million worldwide, with a record-breaking $162 million debut in the States – giving Greta Gerwig the mantle of highest-grossing opening weekend for a female director. And Oppenheimer – a three-hour, often black-and-white historical political drama – was caught up in the chain reaction, earning over $174 million, with IMAX cinemas now sold out weeks in advance. It all adds up to the biggest box office weekend since Avengers: Endgame arrived in 2019, this time split across two non-franchise, non-superhero, non-typical juggernauts.\n\nIt’s not the first time a viral trend has made the leap from internet gag to IRL phenomenon – last year saw Gen Z go wild for ‘GentleMinions’, where another seemingly ridiculous idea (dress up in your finest suits to celebrate the belated return of those sentient yellow Tic Tacs in Minions: The Rise Of Gru) resulted in major turnouts at the multiplex. ‘Barbenheimer’ began from a similarly ‘Wouldn’t it be funny if…’ notion, when film fans discovered that Nolan’s deeply serious A-bomb biopic was launching on the same day as Gerwig’s deeply unserious plastic-fantastic comedy; the notion of seeing both in quick succession seemed inherently hilarious.\n\nIt went from a notion that was merely pleasantly ridiculous, to pleasantly ridiculous and an absolute must-do.\n\nAnd yet, somewhere along the way, that idea mutated, gained traction. Maybe it was the way the memed designs – a figure, half-Barbie half-Oppenheimer, donning a hat; ‘Oppenheimer’ written in the Barbie font – quickly became purchasable items, morphing from a digital running joke into something tangible and real-world, as did the concept of actually seeing both on the same day. Perhaps it was the way that it encroached on the press tour for each film: Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie posed with their Oppenheimer cinema ticket (sparked by Mission: Impossible’s Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise; notably, the trend didn’t become ‘Barbenheimpossible’), while Christopher Nolan called the notion of doing the double a “great” one. Like Margot Robbie’s Barbie herself – and, for that matter, Oppenheimer’s atomic bomb – what began as a mere idea soon became real.\n\nSurely contributing to the ‘Barbenheimer’ blowout is that both films received excellent reviews – after weeks of omnipresent Barbie marketing, a thunderous Oppenheimer campaign, and all the accompanying Barben-hype, the critical consensus for both Gerwig and Nolan’s films was rapturously positive. And while strong reviews don’t always equal strong box office, it had a catalytic effect here – evolving the conversation once more from the notion that you could watch both in a day, to the idea that you should; that each film stands as a triumph from a distinctive directorial voice, and that for all their seeming differences, to watch both back-to-back would mean seeing two of the best movies of the year across one single super-sized, super-cinematic outing. It went from a notion that was merely pleasantly ridiculous, to pleasantly ridiculous and an absolute must-do.\n\nAs the idea snowballed – the realisation that people really were going to see both spurring others on to do the same – it soon became clear that Barbie and Oppenheimer make for a surprisingly great double bill. The Day-Glo colours and wacky comedy of Barbie and the intense atmosphere of doom of Oppenheimer don’t just weirdly complement each other; in Gerwig’s (and co-writer Noah Baumbach’s) hands, Barbie itself contrasts its gleaming surfaces with deep explorations of existential ideas. They are both, oddly, about reckoning with our purpose in life; about interrogating the (destructive) role of men in society; about bridging the chasm between ideas and reality. Just, one does it with neon rollerblades and a Dua Lipa disco track. And they’re both big-screen must-sees – distinctive examples of impeccable filmmaking craft, delivering undeniable cinematic spectacle in a different way to the usual fight sequences of a summer blockbuster.\n\nThe cumulative effect of Barbenheimer created the very thing that Hollywood has perhaps struggled to conjure in recent years: the sense of an all-out cinematic event. It was one that people actively wanted to be part of: to contribute to the conversation of whether you’d seen one, or both; to share stories of how busy it was in the cinema; to see the most-hyped releases of the year in packed houses, all laughing together at Barbie’s most uproarious jokes, or in a shared sense of deep terror at Oppenheimer’s bomb blast. You really did have to be there – of everything to do in the world this weekend, being at your local cinema was the #1 destination. It’s a rare but wonderful occurrence, most recently felt with Endgame’s ‘see it before anyone else spoils it’ excitement, or Parasite’s ‘no, this is really one of the best and most enthralling thrillers you’ll have seen in years’ dismantling of the one-inch-tall subtitle barrier (as director Bong Joon-Ho put it).\n\nAnd that’s where cinemas have really won this weekend: whether driven by memes, by reviews, or by a simple desire to be involved, people have flocked to their local movie-houses this weekend, and probably had their best experience there in years. The lessons Hollywood takes from it remain to be seen – a Barbenheimer likely can’t be manufactured, nor is it a simple case of counter-programming, nor necessarily a signal that audiences want more movies based on historic toy brands or, um, weapons of mass destruction. Perhaps it’s a sign that sequels aren’t the be-all and end-all anymore. Perhaps it’s an indication that allowing talented filmmakers to take major risks and marketing them properly is the way forward. Perhaps people just wanted to wear pink and have fun – and who can blame them? But for whatever reason audiences entered their Barbie and Oppenheimer screenings, they likely left with a greater appreciation of the cinema experience. Your move, Hollywood."

In fact, both films' ticket sales fell just 43% from their opening weekends.\n\nTypically, blockbuster features will see ticket sales fall between 50% and 70% after the debut weekend. Second week numbers are often looked at by box office analysts as an indicator of whether a film will have longevity at the box office or will fizzle quickly. The smaller the drop, the better.\n\n\"'Barbenheimer' will go down as one of the most notable and unforeseeable milestones in the history of cinema not just for what it means to the bottom-line box office dollars for the industry but also as a cultural event centered around moviegoing,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.\n\nOver the weekend, \"Barbie\" added $93 million, bringing its domestic haul to $351 million. The Greta Gerwig and Mattel collaboration for Warner Bros. is nearing $800 million worldwide and could become the second billion-dollar film of 2023.\n\nUniversal 's \"Oppenheimer,\" meanwhile, tallied another $46.7 million over the weekend. Its domestic gross now stands at $175 million. Globally, it's generated $405 million.\n\n\"For a domestic summer marketplace desperately in need of a box office boost, the July 21 simultaneous theatrical debuts of 'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' set off a chain reaction of overall box office that has infused the all-important season with nearly three quarters of a billion dollars of bonus cash,\" Dergarabedian said.\n\nHeading into \"Barbenheimer's\" first weekend, the summer box office, which runs from the first weekend in May through Labor Day, was down around 7% compared to 2022. Two weeks later, it's up 9%, according to data from Comscore.\n\nSimilarly, the confluence of these two films boosted the overall domestic box office compared with last year's haul to this point. Prior to \"Barbenheimer,\" ticket sales were up 12%. Two weeks later, they were up 20%.\n\nThe overall domestic box office still lags behind prepandemic levels by around 16%, however. And prospects for catching up are dwindling as studios have started to move big releases to next year as Hollywood digs in for drawn-out writers' and actors' strikes.\n\nDisclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC. NBCUniversal is the distributor of \"Oppenheimer.\""

        "text": "Tom Cruise, the star who is credited with saving the box office after Top Gun: Maverick flew to $1.5 billion in global ticket sales, is now facing another kind of reckoning — surviving the Barbenheimer effect.\n\nHis Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One tumbled a franchise-worst 64 percent to $19.5 million in its second weekend when going up against Barbie and Oppenheimer, whose dual arrivals transformed into a cultural phenomenon and propelled the domestic box office to historic heights. Revenue for the July 21-23 weekend was the fourth-biggest of all time; in addition, it was the first time ever that one movie opened to $100 million or more and another to $50 million or more. Barbie scored $155 million, followed by $80.5 million for Oppenheimer. No one in Hollywood anticipated such a staggering turnout.\n\nThe seventh installment in Paramount and Skydance’s storied Mission: Impossible series, which finished Sunday with a domestic total of $118.8 million, had hoped to earn as much as $25 million in its second outing.\n\nThe question now is whether Dead Reckoning Part One can level out and enjoy a long run as other series installments have done, and just as Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick did. Executives across Hollywood, and not just at Paramount, aren’t ruling Dead Reckoning out just yet, especially since it has a better critics’ score on Rotten Tomatoes than Barbie and Oppenheimer, as well as strong audience exit scores.\n\n“I don’t think the story has yet been written,” says one executive at a rival studio.\n\nMission: Impossible pics have never sported mega-openings, yet expectations were high for Dead Reckoning after Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick opened to $160.5 million over Memorial Day weekend in 2022, including $126.7 million for the three days. Dead Reckoning had been tracking to open to $90 million in its first five days beginning July 12; instead, it took in a franchise-best $78.5 million, not adjusted for inflation.\n\nTitles in the Mission franchise have always drawn a larger percentage of their global gross from the foreign box office. Dead Reckoning Part One is no exception. It earned another $55 million from 72 markets in its second weekend for a foreign tally of $252.1 million and $370.9 million globally through Sunday. It is doing especially well in Asia, where Barbie and Oppenheimer aren’t strong players. And in a number of markets, it is pacing 15 percent or more ahead of 2018’s Mission: Impossible — Fallout. In Japan, it debuted to $7.9 million, 23 percent ahead of Fallout, which earned a franchise-best $571.5 million overseas for a global total of $791.7 million, including $220.2 million in North America.\n\nMission: Impossible 7 had to contend with losing Imax screens for three weeks to Oppenheimer, in addition to losing premium large-format screens to both Oppenheimer and Barbie. The upcharge for Imax and PLFs is significant and can have a big impact on the bottom line. In early July, Imax screens were dedicated to Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.\n\nCruise’s latest movie, directed by Christopher McQuarrie, cost nearly $300 million to produce and saw its release date delayed numerous times because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was initially set to open in summer of 2021, then summer or fall of 2022. Its release date ultimately landed on mid-July of this year, a date dictated by the shooting schedule of Dead Reckoning Part Two and Cruise’s availability to promote Part One (the actor is known for his global marketing efforts).\n\nAdds another observer: “Barbenheimer siphoned off MI7′s potential this weekend, with Oppenheimer drawing older males away from Dead Reckoning. Not only that, Sound of Freedom is an unexpected force to be reckoned with and is presenting competition from an unlikely source.”\n\nEstimates for the U.S. box office show Angel Studios’ faith-based political thriller Sound of Freedom beating Dead Reckoning for the weekend with $20.1 million for a cume of $123.4 million (Sound of Freedom opened July 4), according to Comscore. Paramount and other studios show Dead Reckoning beating Sound of Freedom; Monday actuals will determine the order.\n\nMission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part Two is set to open in theaters June 28, 2024. McQuarrie and Cruise have shot much of the movie, but production is now halted because of the SAG-AFTRA strike in another moment of reckoning for the storied action franchise.\n\nThings looked different in late June, when Cruise — Hollywood’s highest-profile advocate for the theatrical experience — urged audiences to see Dial of Destiny. And, yes, two other movies in a surprisingly effective plea. Wrote the actor on Instagram : “I love a double feature, and it doesn’t get more explosive (or more pink) than one with Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer and Greta Gerwig’s Barbie.”"

Learn more about the opportunities here.\n\nA new AI-generated movie trailer that splices together the wildly-hyped movies Barbie and Oppenheimer into a mashup — featuring a pink mushroom cloud — has gone viral.\n\nThe trailer offers a spot-on sendup on the “Barbenheimer” hype that had moviegoers flocking to see both movies back-to-back, even though the two films couldn’t be more different — Oppenheimer is a sober biopic about the life and legacy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, father of the atomic bomb, while Barbie is a fizzy, feminist, live-action look at the famous doll.\n\n>>Don’t miss our special issue: The Future of the data center: Handling greater and greater demands.<<\n\nPowered by image generation AI Midjourney and movie generator Runway Gen2 and featuring AI-generated voices supposedly belonging to Margot Robbie and Matt Damon, the “Barbenheimer” crossover took just four days to make, according to the creator’s Reddit post, where he shared a link to his course on AI filmmaking.\n\nVB Event The AI Impact Tour Connect with the enterprise AI community at VentureBeat’s AI Impact Tour coming to a city near you! Learn More\n\nBut as a reporter covering AI’s cheerful, bullish, even fluffy side as well as its serious, sobering side, I can’t help but think about three things the AI-generated ‘Barbenheimer’ movie trailer says about the state of generative AI right now.\n\n1. AI-generated entertainment is moving fast — perfect for today’s viral moments.\n\nSo, it’s no surprise that as the Barbenheimer hype rocketed upward, any online content-maker could jump on board with their own quick-and-dirty AI-generated take to share across social platforms. A traditional ad agency couldn’t possibly move fast enough to pull off the same kind of “Barbenheimer” sendup to meet the moment, and the costs would be prohibitive enough that they likely wouldn’t even try.\n\nIn an era when social media content is part of the zeitgeist more than ever, there’s no doubt that the speed of development of AI-generated entertainment is perfectly placed for today’s viral moments. Back in March, for example, a Reddit user shared an AI-generated video of Will Smith eating spaghetti on the r/StableDiffusion subreddit. It quickly spread on social media as well as the mainstream press, with one article saying the video “would haunt you for the rest of your life.”\n\n2. The ‘Barbenheimer’ trailer comes as creatives strike and regulators play AI catchup.\n\nHollywood has come nearly to a halt in recent weeks, with SAG-AFTRA actors and writers currently on strike and expressing particular concerns about the impact of gen AI on their industry and jobs. The “Barbenheimer” trailer is a perfect example: Who needs the pricey services of Margot Robbie and Matt Damon if you can come up with a serviceable AI copy? Why use the time-consuming work of artists or editors when you have the speedy output of Midjourney and Runway Gen 2?\n\nAt the same time, AI-focused creatives who are excited by the possibilities of gen AI are going full-steam ahead — even as regulators and policy-makers sprint to catch up. The Senate will be schooled in AI this fall with an eye towards a foundation for developing regulations in 2024. Will that be too little, too late?\n\n3. The current generative AI hype may just be a candy-colored wrapper around a more serious, unsettling reality.\n\nThe AI-generated Barbenheimer trailer is, in my opinion, funny and adorable. But the idea that you could wrap one of history’s most horrifying periods — the development of the atomic bomb during World War II, which led to the death of hundreds of thousands at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 — in a candy-colored Barbie wrapper and a pink mushroom cloud is equal parts stunning and shocking.\n\nThat’s gen AI in a nutshell — stunning and shocking, exciting and frightening, dazzling and appalling, sometimes all at once. But certainly, all stakeholders involved in AI development need to consider not just the sugary surface of what gen AI can do, but the deep, real issues that lay underneath."

        "text": "Rafu Wire Service and Staff Reports\n\nWarner Bros. has issued an apology in response to a controversy over popular memes combining two movies — “Barbie,” based on Mattel’s line of dolls, and “Oppenheimer,” a historical drama about the development of the atomic bomb.\n\nAn example of a meme combining “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer.”\n\nSince the movies have topped the box office in the U.S. since their release on July 21, media reports encouraging viewers to see both, on the same day if possible, have coined the term “Barbenheimer.”\n\nThe cheerful memes combine Margot Robbie as Barbie with Cillian Murphy as physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, often with a mushroom cloud in the background. One meme showed Barbie with a mushroom-cloud hairstyle.\n\nWarner Bros.’ initial response to the mashups was positive. “Barbie” is distributed by Warner Bros. and “Oppenheimer” by Universal.\n\nAfter receiving criticism on July 31 from Warner Bros. Japan LLC, Warner Bros. Film Group said in a statement, “Warner Brothers regrets its recent insensitive social media engagement. The studio offers a sincere apology.”\n\nWarner Bros Japan’s statement read, in part, “Because the movies ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’ were both released in America on July 21, there is currently a movement driven by overseas fans to watch them together (#Barbenheimer), but this is not an official movement. We find the reaction to this fan-driven movement from the official American account for the movie ‘Barbie’ to be extremely regrettable.”\n\nYoung activists in Japan on Aug. 1 launched a petition urging the distributors of the hit movies to disavow the “Barbenheimer” hashtag, saying that it is a “clear indication that there is a widespread lack of awareness about the atrocities of atomic bombing” and that the social media activity “completely disregards the suffering of atomic bomb victims and survivors.”\n\n“Barbie” is slated for release in Japan on Aug. 11, just days after the 78th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on Aug. 6 and 9, respectively. A Japanese release date for “Oppenheimer” has yet to be scheduled.\n\nAlthough “Oppenheimer” depicts the testing of the first atomic bomb in the New Mexico desert, the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not shown.\n\nAnother film about the development of the A-bomb, “Fat Man and Little Boy” (1989), with Dwight Schultz as Oppenheimer, also depicted the testing of the first bomb but not the effects of “Little Boy” and “Fat Man” (the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively).\n\nA number of Japanese films have been made about the horrors of the atomic bombings, including Shohei Imamura’s “Black Rain” (1989), based on the novel by Masuji Ibuse, and the animated feature “Barefoot Gen” (1983), based on the manga by Keiji Nakazawa.\n\nMiho Tanaka, 28, one of the activists behind the signature campaign, said she felt “a mixture of anger, sadness and resignation” upon seeing the memes.\n\n“I feel like atomic bomb survivors have experienced things like this many times, but even so, I felt I don’t want them to have to see these images,” she said.\n\nTanaka, however, said that the campaign has no problem with the existence of an Oppenheimer film, and she expressed admiration that the story could be the subject of popular art.\n\n“I was really surprised the U.S., Hollywood no less, could produce a film like that and show it domestically. That it could make a film that would create debate about nuclear weapons is a great thing,” she said.\n\nIn Los Angeles, anti-nuclear activist Tsukuru Fors posted one of the memes on social media and said, “Jokes and memes that are being made about the movies ‘Barbie’ & ‘Oppenheimer’ are not OK. I don’t need to tell you; I hope it is obvious. It is great that people are ‘excited’ about ‘Oppenheimer.’ I hope that people will go see the movie and that it will somehow motivate them to advocate for the abolishment of nuclear weapons. (Neither the U.S. nor Japanese government has signed/ratified the TPNW, Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.)\n\n“I just think that this insensitivity is what happens when the voices/stories of the victims are conveniently eliminated/hidden away from the narrative. That is why it is my/our job to amplify the voices/stories of the victims whenever possible. I owe it to the people of Hiroshima, who gave me the sense of belonging in my formative, teenage years. I owe it to 350 young girls at my high school who lost their lives on Aug. 6, 1945.\n\n“The A-bomb of Hiroshima and Nagasaki collectively took more than 200,000 lives within a few months. Many had to witness their loved ones die in front of their eyes. In fact, many had to leave their loved ones behind while they screamed for help. Many could not find the remains of their loved ones, because they either instantly evaporated, incinerated, or turned unrecognizable.\n\n“The A-bombs caused intergenerational traumas that affect people to this day. And let’s not forget that nuclear atrocities neither began nor ended with Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Please remember hibakusha (victims of nuclear atrocities worldwide) …\n\n“This summer, please go and seek out the stories told in the victims’ voices. Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum has an excellent online database where you can find drawings by survivors, which would leave you overwhelmed but give you the sense of the gravity of the atrocity ….\n\n“I know that some people are so excited about the movies and want to tell the world to go and watch them both, but these jokes and memes are NOT the way to do it.”"

        "text": "German epidemiologists are warning of a summer wave of coronavirus infections, blaming in part mass gatherings such as the Barbenheimer double feature craze.\n\nThe government’s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), says that while infections remain low compared with at the height of the pandemic, they have been on the rise for the past month.\n\nAccording to the government’s Pandemic Radar, which is updated daily by the health ministry, visits to the doctor due to a Covid 19 infection are up 175% on the previous week, and there have been 2,400 cases reported to the RKI this week compared with 400 the previous week, and double the rate of a month ago.\n\nHospital admissions of people with coronavirus are up 50%. More than half of Germany’s monitoring stations, in particular sewage plants, have indicated a rise in viral load detected in wastewater this month.\n\nThe number of official test results shows the rate to be low, at 3 in every 100,000 people. However, the figure itself is hardly a reflection of the real rate, as so few tests are being carried out.\n\n“It could be that we’re having a summer wave,” Timo Ulrichs an epidemiologist at the Berlin Akkon University of Human Sciences, told the news portal Spiegel, adding that the so-called “Barbenheimer effect” was capable of boosting the numbers.\n\nGermany was among the countries where cinemagoers were encouraged to go to watch the blockbuster films Barbie and Oppenheimer as a double feature, in an effort to boost cinema attendance which has yet to recover since the pandemic. So far just under 4 million have seen Barbie, and more than 2.5 million Oppenheimer.\n\nThe idea of a Barbenheimer effect on the spread of the virus was first playfully mooted by the vaccine expert Peter Hotez of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.\n\nSuggesting on Twitter that it might be of concern, due to the millions of people surging to cinemas and spending hours in a windowless room together, he concluded: “We’ll probably never know since no one seems to be keeping track of such things any more.”\n\nNew York has recently recorded a doubling in hospitalisations due to the EG.5 Eris variant of Omicron, which the World Health Organization last week classified as a “variant of interest”.\n\nHotez urged people to keep up with their boosters and wear a pink medical mask – in a nod to Barbie – if they were planning a cinema visit.\n\nGermany’s health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said in reaction to rising levels elsewhere in the world, and the increase in Germany, where the XBB.1.5 variant is currently responsible for most new infections: “our early warning system is activated”.\n\nGermans are being encouraged to get booster jabs in the autumn, if they belong to a higher-risk group, such as those over 60, and people who are overweight, suffer from a lung disease such as COPD, or work in a risky environment such as a hospital. Those who are sick are being advised to stay at home."

Perfected down to the minute details, it solidifies the film as director Christopher Nolan’s best, and perhaps his most insurmountable.\n\nHere’s Nick Schager’s take:\n\n“Christopher Nolan’s cinema is one of dualities: between knowledge and ignorance (Memento); seeing and sightlessness (Insomnia); good and evil (The Dark Knight); illusion and authenticity (The Prestige); dreaming and waking (Inception); courage and cowardice (Dunkirk); and the past and the present (Tenet). In that regard, Oppenheimer—a film of endless contrasts and contradictions—is the fullest expression of the writer/director’s artistry to date.\n\nPropelled by the inexorable march of progress and imagination and electrified by the terrible thrill of theories, dreams, and miracles realized in all their devastating glory, it’s a divided epic of awe and horror, fission and fusion. It’s simultaneously a unified portrait of a conflicted man and a singular achievement for Hollywood’s reigning blockbuster auteur.\n\nAdapted from Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning 2005 biography American Prometheus, Oppenheimer (July 21, in theaters) begins with images of raindrops falling on a pond’s surface and fiery detonations in the void—the first of innumerable opposing visions that are in unlikely harmony, or at least uneasy coexistence, in Nolan’s masterpiece.\n\nAn individual of myriad paradoxes, Cillian Murphy’s J. Robert Oppenheimer is a scientist (and the father of theoretical physics in the United States) who adores art and culture; a towering intellectual who’s incompetent in the laboratory; an arrogant leader who’s unwilling to fight; a devoted lover and partner who’s habitually unfaithful; and the architect of modern annihilation who wants to foster global peace. When, early in his academic career, he’s drawn to quantum physics, because it suggests that the impossible—namely, that light is both a wave and a particle—is true, it’s a telling snapshot of his inherent attraction to the irreconcilable.”\n\nRead more.\n\nSee: Barbie\n\nBarbie makes the plastic way more than just fantastic; Greta Gewig’s film reaches new heights for mainstream cinema, proving that it’s not necessary to sacrifice a story’s empathetic soul just because its main character comes in a box.\n\nHere’s Coleman Spilde’s take:\n\n“With all of the chatter regarding the Barbie movie for the last four years, the most pressing question has ended up being whether Greta Gerwig’s film could exceed the insurmountable hype surrounding it. There was an influx of candid set photos, multiple trailers and pre-release clips, and massively popular memes that quickly created a level of fatigue that was just as ubiquitous as the Barbie poster generator. Barbie was a sensation long before we were close enough to see the radiant pink glow of its looming July 21 release date. Surely, no matter how good the film was, it could never fully live up to that amount of sheer anticipation.\n\nBut to settle for tempered expectations is simply not the Barbie way. Barbie can be a doctor, a CEO, a politician, and even a damn mermaid. The sky's the limit for Barbie—scratch that; she’ll become an astronaut and defy that restriction too. With all of these achievements under Barbie’s belt, who better to bring her story to the big screen than Gerwig? In her career as a writer and a director, Gerwig has crafted exceptional, singular films that brilliantly assess the subtleties of womanhood. No one is quite so adept at making the ultra-specific feel universal.”\n\nRead more.\n\nSkip: Futurama\n\nFuturama’s third reboot revives the iconic animated comedy for another blast through space and time, but the new season’s futurist satire of the 2020s often feels one-note, relying on references to the show’s substantially more impressive original run.\n\nHere’s Allegra Frank’s take:\n\n“Among the countless Simpsons jokes I think about on a near-constant basis, perhaps none comes to mind more often than ‘Moe gets a cell phone.’ In Season 13 of The Simpsons, the show was already well-aware of its own waning critical reception. It lampooned its longevity—which, 21 seasons later, has only become even more surprising—with a self-mocking song performed by NRBQ about how ‘they’ll never stop the Simpsons’: ‘Have no fears, we’ve got stories for years,’ it goes. ‘Like Marge becomes a robot! Maybe Moe gets a cell phone! Has Bart ever owned a bear?’\n\n‘Moe gets a cell phone’ is a wildly threadbare premise for an episode, but if The Simpsons were to continue forever, threadbare premises would have to do. All three of the joking predictions in that song have since come true; Moe got himself a flip phone, and Bart prank-texted him on it. For as often as fans try to argue that The Simpsons is ‘still good,’ ‘They’ll Never Stop the Simpsons’ became not a joke, but an ironic prophecy—a testament to how a good thing doesn’t need to live forever. This was top of mind as I watched Hulu’s reboot of Futurama, The Simpsons’ sister series and perhaps the most immortal television show of the 21st century.”\n\nRead more.\n\nSee: Harley Quinn Season 4\n\nHarley Quinn Season 4 takes the off-the-wall animated series further than ever. The show’s gloriously cheeky nature still pops with this season’s raunchy humor, but it's Harley’s search for personal growth that makes the series more than just vulgar hilarity.\n\nHere’s Laura Bradley’s take:\n\n“All around the Bat Cave in Harley Quinn, you’ll find details designed to remind you of the Bat Family’s one rule. The pillowcase, the WiFi password, and even the singing fish on the wall all want observers to remember that in this crew, ‘We Don’t Kill.’ As reasonable an edict as that might be for a group of vigilantes, and as reformed as the Joker’s former sidekick has become, that demand proves difficult for our newly minted ‘hero.’\n\nWhen she first embraced her main-character energy at the start of Harley Quinn, Kaley Cuoco’s pigtailed harlequin wanted nothing more than to become the empress of darkness—or, at least, a card-carrying Legion of Doom member. By the end of Season 3, however, she’d switched sides to fight with the good guys, even as her girlfriend, Poison Ivy (Lake Bell) took over the villainous group as CEO. Now, as Season 4 kicks off with four episodes on Max starting July 27, the couple’s professional goals could not be further apart.”\n\nRead more.\n\nSign up for our See Skip newsletter here to find out which new shows and movies are worth watching, and which aren’t."

One high-end theater in the Washington, D.C. suburbs went all out on promotion, with pink lights to highlight “Barbie” and a wall of movie posters featuring both films. But the theater may have miscalculated Saturday attendance. By the 10 p.m. showing, it had run out of multiple food items. It also lacked soft drinks and, amazingly, ice.\n\nAnother theater in Arlington, Va., had it worse: The air conditioning went out, leading to a sweltering experience. While the theater offered refunds, many ticket buyers stayed.\n\nThe question now is whether Hollywood can keep the momentum going. Studio executives have long pointed out that moviegoing begets moviegoing — that the habit of watching movies in theaters is crucial. Coming up, however, studios are facing another crisis: A strike by unionized actors, which started on July 14, could force movie companies to push back coming films because striking stars cannot take part in publicity campaigns. “Challengers,” a sports drama involving a love triangle and starring Zendaya, has already been pushed from September to April.\n\nThere are no talks scheduled between SAG-AFTRA, as the actors’ union is known, and studios.\n\n“Oppenheimer” helped fuel “Barbie” and vice versa, with their simultaneous release nicknamed Barbenheimer and movie fans captivated by their wild incongruity. Nolan’s film, which cost Universal Pictures at least $100 million to make, not including a megawatt marketing campaign, is a three-hour period drama about Robert Oppenheimer, the man known as “the father of the atomic bomb.” About 200,000 people purchased tickets to see “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” as a double feature, according to the National Association of Theater Owners, a trade organization."

Fans have made double and triple trips to go watch the movie in theaters again and again. But some people around the world they're only now getting a chance to book their tickets to Barbieland. The Margot Robbie starrer is finally released in Japan, after a huge controversy related to Barbenheimer memes. Here's what happened.\n\nBarbie releases in Japan after Barbenheimer controversy\n\nTickets for Babrie are flying off the shelf in Japan. The Greta Gerwig Directorial, fortunately, clashed with a national holiday in Japan that marks the start of the extended summer holiday week in the country, prompting many people to go out for a movie night. The viral trend of \"Barbenheimer\" stirred controversy in Japan, as the country had recently commemorated the 78th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In the now-deleted post on Twitter, Warner Bros. marketing account for Barbie had started posting fan-made memes which showed Robbie alongside Oppenheimer's Cillian Murphy merged with the images of nuclear explosions.\n\nThe outrage was so intense that at one point a petition was made on Change.org urging Warner Bros and Universal Pictures, the studio behind Oppenheimer, to stop using the #Barbenheimer on social media. During that period, #NoBarbenheimer gained traction in the East Asian country leading Warner's Japan division to publicly criticize its U.S. counterpart, prompting the latter to issue an apology the following week. Despite the controversy, Japanese fans of the film expressed that the situation did not deter them from wanting to watch the movie in theaters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nALSO READ: Oppenheimer star Cillian Murphy open to playing Ken in Barbie sequel; praises Barbenheimer\n\nNo Oppenheimer release date in sight\n\nWhile fans were finally able to see Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling's Barbie on the big screens, the same cannot be said for Christopher Nolan's movie. No official release date for Oppenheimer has been made public in Japan. The Cillian Murphy starrer has faced criticism for its limited acknowledgment of the devastating impact of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, which resulted in the loss of over 200,000 lives.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbie has taken over the world, quite literally, you can't possibly scroll on social media for 2 minutes without coming across at least 1 post about the movie.\n\nALSO READ: Why did Warner Bros apologize to Japanese division over Barbenheimer meme?

        "text": "Photo-Illustration: Vulture; Photos: Warner Brothers, Universal Pictures\n\nAt the corner of 68th Street and Broadway, Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One is serving only one purpose: being my decoy ticket as I enter the world of Barbenheimer. After a successful opening weekend of his own, Tom Cruise just might be flopping in the face of these unlikely twin movies, officially born on July 21, that are ushering in a palpably exciting cinematic moment. Before arriving, I had a stray thought that maybe Barbenheimer exists only in the hearts of the terminally online, hyped up by media people such as myself but not really going to make as much noise IRL. Like, fine, the National Association of Theatre Owners is projecting that more than 200,000 moviegoers will do the double feature, per the Wrap, but that doesn’t mean much to someone who hasn’t taken a math class since 12th grade. Cruise may be under the impression that he’s cinema’s one true savior, brought to this earth to base-jump off cliffs and scale the Burj Khalifa to atone for our sins and sell seats to people who don’t really go to the movies anymore. But today, based on the neon-pink evidence at Manhattan’s AMC Lincoln Square, moviegoers don’t want to be saved. They want to be Barbenheimed.\n\nIt’s July 20, around 5:45 p.m., and everyone’s here for Greta Gerwig’s pink psychedelics or Christopher Nolan’s movie about a man in a porkpie hat. Kathleen Mukamal is doing the double feature alone. “I’m the same age as Barbie, you know,” she explains to me, wearing head-to-toe pink. “They say she was born months after me. I’m late in ’58. She’s ’59.” Mukamal’s fit matches the bandanna worn by her slayful Yorkshire terrier, Ruby, who’s attending the screening with her owner. It’s Oppenheimer first and then Barbie for her “because it was just what was available,” she says. “I got the front seat in each row. You know, the last seats that were available.”\n\nRuby and her owner, Kathleen Mukamal. Photo: Zoe Guy\n\nWhile loitering in the lobby, I’m confronted by an invasion of every shade of pink — fuchsia and coral and bubblegum and ballet slipper — all marching in lockstep up the escalators leading to the second and third floors. The sea of pink makes me happy I wore my magenta short-sleeved button-down, even if the sweat I emitted on the MTA’s saunalike platform is so bad that it’s gonna rudely manipulate me into finally taking the 100 percent silk shirt to the dry cleaner, a task I’ve managed to dodge since stealing it from my sister. If I hadn’t dressed for the occasion, I would simply look bitter and unpatriotic in the face of everyone else who adhered to the dress code. No one’s really dressing for Oppenheimer, as far as I can tell — except for the pair of men in blue shirts and briefcases who are running across the place at great speed, late for their screening, I suppose — but a third of the nearly two dozen people I speak with later are here for both. Maybe my pink is a force field against anyone who’s just seeing Oppenheimer, unclear, but not a soul I speak to tells me they’re here solely for a screening of that film. In the idle din at the moment, I overhear someone ask, “When’s the last time you had fun at the movies?” I can see this is the experience Cruise is probably horny for.\n\nI join the long line of people waiting to get inside the theater until I do a double take after seeing a young couple in matching Barbenheimer T-shirts. One shirt is pink and the other is black, but both share graphics with the movies in question and have Barbenheimer emblazoned in the Barbie font … or is it the Oppenheimer font? I get their attention. “We would love to talk, but we’re late for our Barbie showing,” the man says before I can get a good look. Being late is not an option, knowing that moviegoers paid upwards of $40 for the double feature tonight, not including their outfits, popcorn, and a drink.\n\nTaking in the scene, you don’t need to be a nuclear physicist to see that Barbie is winning this theater’s marketing battle and is even doing enough heavy lifting for Oppenheimer to benefit. There’s a massive Barbie ad on the escalator landing. A Barbie step-and-repeat with a matching pink carpet. A life-size Barbie-doll box. Each photo opportunity offers moviegoers the chance to take commemorative pictures with their dates holding pink Barbie Corvettes and dolls purchased at the concession stand (a $64.99 bundle) in one hand and free Barbie posters in the other. Though there’s nothing Oppenheimer-themed save for a poster in the dark first-floor lobby, a few people I chat with think Barbie’s 18-month marketing strategy has had a Reaganomics trickle-down effect on why they’re here for the bomb movie, too. “I am here to see Barbenheimer,” Matt tells me, wearing his ultrahigh platform heels and baby-pink Barbie tank while waiting to take pics in one of the photo ops. Why? “Well, Barbie ’cause Barbie’s everything, and Oppenheimer ’cause I need to know what the hype’s for.” Willyan Ferreira, for their part, adds that “pink is a very powerful color, and so is an atomic bomb.” A pink-and-blue virus has taken root here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/ 4\n\nChris, wearing a DayGlo Ken outfit, also thinks the Barbenheimer alliance is a joint slay. “I actually see it as a truce,” he says. His partner, Omar, sports yet another baby-pink tank, accessorized with a fuchsia bandanna around his neck. Chris continues, “I think anything that encourages people to go to the movies, like, great, do more double giant releases to get people back.” He’s optimistic about how this model could work in cinema’s favor: “I feel like this is the first time since the pandemic people are really flooding the movie theaters. I was laughing, saying I feel like the staff today is going to be like, ‘I don’t even remember how to do this!’”\n\nAfter a bit of a dustup with an usher who’s confused about why I bought a ticket for a movie I’m not seeing, I’m standing in the concessions area. Nearly every register is occupied to feed the masses, and the lines snake around the stanchions like a busy airport-security check. A screening of Barbie just let out, and I catch two college students from it sporting unofficial merch. Arnav Das is in a shirt featuring Ryan Gosling’s Ken, and Sofia Cedeño is wearing a shirt decorated with Margot Robbie’s Barbie; they tell me more merch should include T-shirts of the memes. “Have you seen the picture where it’s like Barbie and Oppenheimer shaking hands and then it’s blowing up in the background?” Cadeño asks me. I haven’t seen the meme. “They are, like, facing each other. Yeah, that’s the one I would want.”\n\nPhoto: Zoe Guy\n\nThey leave, and I wait in line with Luna Rahzel, a cosplayer who tells me she purchased two rows — that’s 22 tickets — for her and her cohort when tickets first went on sale. We make our way to the front of the line and Rahzel nabs the Corvette popcorn bucket and the Barbie-doll bundle on sale. Luckily, she’s here two hours early to grab some of the clearly dwindling supply. “Mattel is making hand over fist on this,” she jokes. “Woo, late-stage capitalism!”\n\nSome still seem to think Barbenheimer shouldn’t have declared a truce. Beth Slade, Hayden Murphy, and Caileigh Potter are “absolutely not” here for Nolan. “What are you going to wear to it? Black?” Potter wonders. “I don’t want to watch people get blown up. The world is dark enough as it is. I want to watch some joy, some pink, something silly, maybe cry a little bit, but in a fun, lighthearted way that’s nostalgic.” Skylar Theis, who will actually see both films, nails it: “She’s everything; he’s just Oppenheimer.”"

Or post-Oppie?' he asked his 465,000 Twitter followers.\n\n'We'll probably never know since no one seems to be keeping track of such things anymore. Keep up with your boosters and find a pink N-95 or KN-95 if you can.'\n\nDr. Peter Hotez said he knew he was being a 'Debbie Downer,' but warned people to take care if they were packing cinemas to see Barbie or Oppenheimer\n\nBarbie, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, is the biggest film opening so far this year\n\nOppenheimer, starring Cillian Murphy, has also drawn large crowds to movie theatres\n\nBoth films opened this weekend to widespread acclaim and large crowds.\n\nBarbie was the biggest opening of the year, with $162 million at the box office, while Oppenheimer took $82 million.\n\nThe surge in cinema attendance comes as COVID hospitalization rates trended slightly up last week but remained massively below their levels of even a year ago.\n\nIn the week of July 15, a total nationwide of 7,109 people were admitted to the hospital with COVID. By comparison, this week last year saw 45,000 people admitted.\n\nHotez made headlines in June when Democrat long-shot presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a noted anti-vaxxer, challenged the doctor to a debate on Joe Rogan's podcast.\n\nThat led Rogan, too, to challenge Hotez to a debate.\n\nHotez said he would happily appear on Rogan's show, but would not engage in a circus fight with Kennedy.\n\nThe suggestion of a Hotez-Kennedy debate sparked an online frenzy, and saw Hotez challenged at his home by Alex Rosen, a self-proclaimed 'independent journalist' who works for a site called 'Predator Poachers.'\n\nRosen, after exchanging pleasantries, asked Hotez why he wouldn't debate Kennedy.\n\n'Aw come on, that's harassing,' Hotez replied.\n\n'I'm just curious, nothing hostile, just curious,' responded Rosen.\n\nHotez says he's been stalked outside his home, as one right-wing commentator posted a video confronting him\n\nHotez said he hadn't made a decision, saying Rogan 'just invited me, so we'll see. We'll give it some thought.'\n\nAfter repeating he felt Hotez should debate, Rosen asked: 'What do you say to people who think they're vaccine injured?'\n\nHotez, clearly perturbed, began to close his gate and started to walk away from Rosen.\n\n'Ugh I just was stalked in front of my home by a couple of anti-vaxers taunting me to debate RFK Jr,' he tweeted.\n\n'Of course I was looking my Sunday best in our brutal heat wave. What is it with people?'\n\nKennedy in the interview on Rogan's podcast repeated his debunked claims that common childhood vaccines cause autism, which Hotez called 'just awful'.\n\nHotez added: 'It's clear many actually believe this nonsense.'\n\nRogan fired back with a challenge: 'Peter, if you claim what RFK Jr. is saying is 'misinformation' I am offering you $100,000.00 to the charity of your choice if you're willing to debate him on my show with no time limit.'\n\nRogan's interview with Kennedy drew backlash from Hotez who objected to vaccine concerns calling it 'just awful' as he lamented 'it's clear many actually believe this nonsense.'\n\nRFK Jr. appeared on Rogan's podcast, repeating his debunked claims that common childhood vaccines cause autism\n\nIn multiple tweets, Hotez indicated his willingness to appear on Rogan's podcast, which reaches a massive audience of millions on Spotify.\n\n'I'm happy to come on and have a meaningful discussion. I respect you and your show and I don't want an adversarial relationship. I think we can make some progress,' tweeted Hotez.\n\n'And I'm open to a number of different options, but to be pressured to give you an answer on Twitter, now, with a 'take it or leave it' demand that's not how I work. Honestly, I don't even think that would be in your best interests,' he wrote.\n\nKennedy also indicated his willingness to engage, tweeting: 'Peter. Let's finally have the respectful, congenial, informative debate that the American people deserve.'"

        "text": "The Barbenheimer phenomenon is almost certainly the most obnoxiously contrived and contrivedly obnoxious show business event since the day Danny Snyder pretended to put his wife in charge of the Washington Commanders. Everyone connected with this cynical combo plate, from filmmakers through actors, reviewers through moviegoers, deserve all the eye, skin, and social diseases one can get from trying to cut in on the latest trend in cultural death. Maybe that's just because your author seems to have other things to do when every movie in the world plays.\n\nBut because of an editor who will remain nameless even though it is that bastard Petchesky, Barbenheimer in the theater it had to be, upon which two things became clear.\n\nIf you watched Barbie before Oppenheimer as your victimized typist did, you got the order wrong. Barbie is simply a spoiler alert for our post-apocalyptic future, and in that context Oppenheimer merely becomes the turgid tale of a self-absorbed and smug power nerd who didn't make enough bombs to avert the future that included Barbie. Everybody with an opinion about this hype-powered combo-dirigible has already given it, and the verdict is in—they're both movies. Taken individually, they have that certain indefinable je ne sais blah, but rammed together they are famous for simply making no thematic sense as a pairing, forcing otherwise borderline decent people to compare blancmange and concrete because some death-warrants-with-marketing-degrees decreed it shall be an \"event.\" The wolverines who lunched up this twin monstrosity bought time, space, and bandwidth anywhere that accepted free content or ad money, found that news organizations are desperate to avoid all forms of work, and therefore hook/line/sinkered the whole mess, just to show their bosses they could.\n\nBarbie was, of course, all about the marketing, and in our theater (name withheld to keep the lawyers caged), the number of elderly folks dressed like Barbie and Ken reminded us yet again to see the good side of the planet being baked into oblivion by global warming. Even the restaurant adjacent to our local theater made its workers dress as Barbie characters (not hard, as most of the characters are either Barbie or Ken, and nobody is dressing up like Rhea Perlman) and offered up menu choices like Barbie Malibu (coconut rum infused with bubble gum extract, for the professional diabetic in your life) and Radioactive Deviled Eggs (probably an Oppenheimer reference but one can’t be certain).\n\nThe warmup act for Barbie was a couple of preteen girls either employed or dragooned to play a song (electric ukulele, to give you an idea) in a burst of reimagined vaudeville that can best be explained by the deathless phrase, \"This is a song we wrote last week, and I think it's the best song we've ever done.\" That seems a safe enough bet, and the polite army of Barbie impersonators in the audience applauded their courage.\n\nThe fact that nobody dressed up as Robert Oppenheimer at Movie Night, or really at any time since 1962, isn't the point. It's that cinematic polar opposites were shotgun-married to fake a weekend outing at the services of the Mattel Corporation and the wheezing movie industry.\n\nIt was a good weekend for box offices, (an estimated $155M for Barbs, $80M for Oppy), but how about the films? Your misshapen stenographer is not a movie critic and would rather become a narcotics informer than begin now, but you're paying for halfwit opinions, so here's another: Meh. Barbie plays out as if it were imagined by Joseph Stalin, Sofia Vergara, Brian Wilson, and a closet of crank-fueled HGTV showrunners, while Oppenheimer plays out as Stalin's breakout solo project. Either way, the villains (Lewis Strauss v. Ryan Gosling-Ken) are the same guy, and the heroes (Ruth Handler vs. Kitty Oppenheimer) aren't on long enough. And like most movies, the universal takeaway here is that the old adage, \"Always leave them wanting less,\" wins again. In this case the \"less\" in question is about 25 minutes of each, or the time of the average moviehouse nap, which your author successfully executed right about the time Matt Damon shows up as Sympathetic Careerist Colonel Pain In The Ass. No plot points were missed.\n\nBarbie decidedly began as more fun, Oppenheimer profoundly more dismal, and while after a clever run-up (hey, it's Helen Mirren!) Barbie got grimmer as the plot dumbed itself down for the required 10th-grade-level back-end movie lecture, Oppenheimer's lead in soul-crushing moroseness was too much to overcome. Then again, Oppenheimer was supposed to be Lars von Trier–level bleak, so in that way I guess it wins this match that should never have been made.\n\nThat's the real takeaway from the two films if, like us, you prefer people make their own judgments about their entertainment and then do the rest of the party the great courtesy of keeping their opinions to themselves. Both movies in their mashup form, after four Empress and tonics, two Angry Orchard ciders, and five or eight glasses of wine, seem to be treatises on America's polarities of institutionalized despair. No, your perturbed reviewer did not order all those himself. This is important for you to know because (a) no single person could drink that much and not breathalyze a night in the can, and (b) to let the kids in Defector Accounting know that they are on the hook for three dinners, six tickets, and all the alcohol. Yep, you sent us to the movies and we made it cost about three bills. Next time, you'll think a little harder about both the financial and psychic cost of such assignments. We could sit through Oppenheimer one more time at home if only to see what we missed during the nap, but Barbie is a one-off, as it was meant to be.\n\nIn other words, this entire mudslide of a weekend is now over and never to be referenced again. Even if the studios want to try this gambit again (imagine remakes of La La Land and The Killing Fields played for a film class at Northwestern with students powered by four hours' sleep and three gallons of Fireball), it will be hard to imagine us lurching at this particular hook ever again. After all, once is slightly forced weirdness, but twice is a week's worth of ESPN programming streamed on a perpetual loop, and absolutely nobody needs that. Plus, we intend to beat up the nameless editor who is still that worm Petchesky and abandon him in the New Hampshire woods. Now there's the happy ending we're all looking for."

        "text": "“Barbenheimer,” the simultaneous July 21 release of Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer,” turned a meme into the most widely anticipated cinematic event of the year. The films’ contrasting aesthetics have been fodder for jokes, photo edits and themed outfits. Fans have been delighting in their favorite filmmakers going head-to-head, pitting pitch black against bubblegum pink.\n\nThe whole thing is funny, if you are able to differentiate the film “Oppenheimer” from its real world inspiration, but that line has definitely blurred. When a “Barbie house” appeared in Malibu as a promotion for the film, the internet was quick to joke that the Oppenheimer team would nuke it for their own marketing campaign.\n\nBarbie and Oppenheimer are both trying to stop the destruction of their own worlds.\n\nThe films’ apparent incongruity created a farcical pairing that busted the box office. Tens of thousands of people bought same-day tickets for both “Oppenheimer” and “Barbie,” watching them as a double feature. In their first weekend, “Oppenheimer” grossed $82.4 million and “Barbie” a whopping $155 million at the domestic box office—becoming the biggest-ever opening box office for a film directed by a woman. What fans who saw both didn’t expect was how well the apparent opposites thematically complement each other.\n\nFor all their differences, Barbenheimer has some genuine thematic throughlines. Lynda Carter, the actress most famous for her portrayal of a super-Barbie role in the 1970s Wonder Woman show, brilliantly observed that “Barbie lives in the world Oppenheimer made.” That is undeniably true. Barbie was first created in the late 1950s, the most nuclear-haunted time of world history, which was also the pinnacle of the post-war consumer boom. “Barbie” may have been a reaction to the post-war restoration of traditional gender roles, when the G.I. Kens came back from the war and Rosie the Riveters were kicked out of the shipyards and sent back to the kitchens.\n\nPerhaps the most striking example was the ending of the free child care programs the federal government had created to accommodate so many mothers going to build planes, tanks and ships. It was an intentional move to get women back into the home. This is almost exactly what occurs in “Barbie,” when Ken returns from the “real world” enamored of patriarchy and ready to introduce traditional gender roles in the Barbieland utopia.\n\nThe actress Lynda Carter brilliantly observed that “Barbie lives in the world Oppenheimer made.”\n\nBoth films dig into titular characters uncomfortable with their own legacies. This may seem an odd comparison. After all, J. Robert Oppenheimer created the atomic bomb, and Barbie is a plastic doll. But both created (and are creations of) their particular moments of American history—moments whose legacies we are still dealing with today.\n\nBarbie takes her legacy very seriously. In the film, all the Barbies in Barbieland think they have solved all the world’s problems for women, but as soon as she enters the real world, a girl accuses Barbie of fascism, stating she makes women feel bad about themselves and displays unrealistic beauty standards. Barbie weeps at this criticism. In a speech intended to celebrate the bomb’s use, Oppenheimer envisions the bomb’s destruction in an incinerated skeleton and a woman with flaking skin. Neither Oppenheimer nor Barbie really understands that they’ve done anything wrong until they confront the effects of their actions. They are both haunted by unintended consequences and wrestle with the fact that many people do not like or approve of them.\n\nTaken together, Barbenheimer is a scathing indictment of life in a man’s world.\n\nNeither character directly apologizes or asks for forgiveness, and neither can truly dismantle the damage they have done. Yet they both try to distance themselves from their pasts. Oppenheimer, in real life and in the film, continues to work in nuclear science but becomes opposed to further nuclear proliferation and the brewing arms race with the Soviets. Meanwhile, Barbie works to let go of the perfectionism that plagues her and her legacy. They are both seeking penance, but neither truly believes they are deserving of forgiveness. Barbie’s fears are met with kindness: Gloria, the woman who brought Barbie to the real world, reassures her: “You are so beautiful and so smart, and it kills me that you don’t think you’re good enough.” Oppenheimer’s wife confirms his fears: “You think because you let them tar and feather you that the world will forgive you? They won’t.”\n\nTaken together, Barbenheimer is a scathing indictment of life in a man’s world. Barbie is overt in its criticism of the patriarchy, even if delivering it within a satire. The male-dominated “Oppenheimer” is a little more subtextual. No women are in the rooms where it is decided to drop the bombs that kill between 129,000 and 226,000 people. U.S. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson jokes he doesn’t want to drop the bomb on Kyoto because he honeymooned there. Nolan uses this moment to underline how out of touch these powerful men are with the reality of what they are doing. Oppenheimer says he lost his faith in the project when he realized that anything he built would be used against our enemies in war. Barbie and Oppenheimer did not choose how the world reacted to them, but there were real-world consequences whether intended or not.\n\nBarbie and Oppenheimer also both deal with existential dread. They question the meaning of death and wrestle with the sanctity of life. Oppenheimer is utilitarian in his thinking about the bomb until it is used. He justifies its creation by saying, “I don’t know if we can be trusted with such a weapon. But I know the Nazis can’t.” But by the time the bomb is built, the Nazis had already been defeated. And though the bombs may have hastened the end of the war, he cannot help feeling he has blood on his hands. Barbie feels the sanctity of her own life as she steps into what it means to be human, mortal and imperfect. These two people didn’t mean to be more than they are. He just wanted to be a physicist, and she just wants to be a woman.\n\nBarbie and Oppenheimer are both trying to stop the destruction of their own worlds. Oppenheimer seems resigned to the fact that the damage is done and nuclear war is inevitable. Barbie is hopeful that things can and will change for the better. They make a much more thought-provoking pairing than a mere internet meme could convey. The juxtaposition of masculine and feminine, destruction and creation, dread and hope, may leave moviegoers thinking a little harder about their own place in the world."

        "text": "As our team scoped the timepieces of everyone involved in the films and promotional tours, Tag Heuer and Hamilton were the clear winners: they were almost the only watch brands present in Barbie and Oppenheimer, respectively.\n\nThe much-anticipated simultaneous release of blockbuster films Barbie and Oppenheimer on July 21 finally brought the “Barbenheimer” movement to a crescendo. The tongue-in-cheek portmanteau refers to the entertaining duality between the bubblegum celebration of Mattel’s iconic doll and the grim ethical and historical overtones from the story of the father of the atomic bomb.\n\nWhile perhaps not quite a thematic Barbenheimer equivalent in the watch world, it’s still interesting to see references from both watch houses appearing on the silver screen and red carpet, thanks to the brands’ partnerships with the films’ cast members.\n\nSpoilers ahead as we check out the timepieces from Barbie and Oppenheimer!\n\nTag Heuer x Barbie\n\nRyan Gosling leads a show-stopping musical number in Barbie. Photo: Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nIt should be far from surprising that Ryan Gosling’s ambassadorship with Tag Heuer made its way into the movie as Beach Ken wrestled with the gender role reversal he experienced in reality vs Barbieland.\n\nKen bringing patriarchy – and plenty of horses – to Barbieland was a sour note in the second act of the film, but it did give us Gosling in a fur coat along with several pairs of shades and no less than three different vintage Heuer Carrera chronographs on his wrists at the same time, as reported by Hodinkee.\n\nTwo of the three Heuer Carreras that Ryan Gosling’s Ken wore in Barbie. Photos: Handout\n\nThe pieces themselves are from the 1960s and 70s, from before Heuer was bought by the Tag racing company and a few years after the original Ken was introduced in 1961. However, we surmise that the watches were chosen not so much for their horological significance (all three are seminal pieces in Heuer’s history of chronographs) but for the sheer golden decadence the pieces exude.\n\nRyan Gosling at Canadian promotions for Barbie, sporting a pink Tag Heuer Carrera Date 36mm. Photo: Getty Images\n\nTo cap it all off, Gosling sported a more modern, pink Tag Heuer Carrera Date 36mm in Toronto for the Canadian leg of promotions, in contrast with his pastel blue and pink suit, per media reports.\n\nHamilton x Oppenheimer\n\nOppenheimer was written and directed by Christopher Nolan. Photo: Universal Pictures\n\nThe temptation to label Tag Heuer x Hamilton the Barbenheimer of watches this summer is strong, but even though both films tapped long-standing partnerships to source three vintage references from the respective brands for the screen, the similarities end there.\n\nHamilton vintage pieces worn by Cillian Murphy in Oppenheimer, from left to right: Cushion B, Lexington and Endicott. Photo: Hamilton\n\nSeasoned director Christopher Nolan tapped his long-standing relationship with Hamilton to source vintage pieces for the biopic on J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb played by Cillian Murphy.\n\nThe film comprises interwoven scenes from Oppenheimer’s early life and career, his work with the Manhattan Project in the 1940s developing the atomic bomb, and subsequent security hearings in the 1950s with Congress and the United States Atomic Energy Commission regarding suspected Communist leanings and his clearance to work on atomic weapons.\n\nMatt Damon wore Hamilton pieces as lieutenant general Leslie Jones in Oppenheimer: left, the Military Ordonance and right, the Piping Rock. Photo: Hamilton\n\nMurphy sported the period-appropriate Cushion B two-handed 1930s piece alongside the black-dialled Lexington and golden Endicott, both with sub-seconds dials and from the 1940s, the brand confirmed.\n\nEmily Blunt , who plays Kitty Oppenheimer, sports the discreet Lady Hamilton A-2 in a square case with gold-coloured indices and hands; while Matt Damon, as lieutenant general Leslie Groves, wears the Piping Rock and Military Ordonance – both quintessential pieces for military men during the period.\n\nHamilton Khaki Field “Murph” 38mm, inspired by the unique version of the Khaki Field Auto from Christopher Nolan’s 2014 film Interstellar. Photo: Hamilton\n\nNolan’s relationship with Hamilton is well-known – as is his tendency to play with the concept of time in his films. Hamilton provided a version of the Khaki Navy BelowZero for his 2020 feature Tenet.\n\nBut his most famous collaboration with the brand was its unique design for the Hamilton Khaki Field. The subsequent significance of the watch to the plot of his 2014 hit Interstellar resulted in the release of the Hamilton Khaki Field Murph 42mm in 2019, per the brand. The latter most recently received a refresh in 38mm in 2022."

        "text": "This summer’s biggest movie releases brought us “Oppenheimer,” a real-life thriller about a weapon that could save and possibly destroy humanity, and “Barbie,” a musical comedy about a doll that thinks she’s solved but actually set back equal rights.\n\nWhile some people have turned the movies into a double-feature, my version of Barbenheimer pairs “Barbie” with “Mild Vertigo,” a newly translated Japanese novel. I haven’t come up with a cute mashup name for these two works that dig into the paradoxes of being a woman. (No spoilers ahead for either film or the book.)\n\n“Mild Vertigo” is narrated by Natsumi, a stay-at-home mom tending to her apartment in Tokyo. We hear voices of neighbors gossiping over the minute differences in the neighborhoods’ apartments A-F. We hear the chatter of birds outside the windows and from Natsumi’s past. And we hear her thoughts, a running commentary of the minutiae in her boring life. What to buy. How to clean. Her days are nothing and everything.\n\nHer stream of consciousness with sentences stretching several pages reminds me of modernist writers like Gertrude Stein from a century ago. Mieko Kanai wrote “Mild Vertigo” in 1997. The English translation was released this spring, leaving me wondering what’s really changed — not stylistically, but the subtext.\n\nAs I write this, I heard the chime of Beepy, the robot vacuum, and paused to empty it and saw the swim bag next to the trashcan and made sure it has my daughter’s swimsuit, the one with long sleeves to protect her from the sun, and water shoes and sunscreen for today’s swim class. (Will it be canceled because there’s a 60% chance of rain? How will the teacher reach out about a cancellation? We’ve emailed but does she check her email often? Can she check it when she spends her day in the pool?) Should I roast some vegetables now when nobody’s in the hot kitchen and was this vacuum a stupid splurge even if it was a Prime Day deal and that review site said it was good and it has cleaned more than any adult has in a while and why do people care about how clean a floor is? Do I care about the people who do care?\n\nNatsumi’s banal narrative exposes what’s beneath the performance of life, maintaining appearances.\n\nIn “Barbie,” the Barbies rule and run Barbieland. They can do anything so they do everything. Their days may not be filled with keeping house and caregiving but they’re still Sisyphean.\n\n“This is the best day ever. So was yesterday and so is tomorrow and every day from now until forever,” says stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) during a fabulously sparkly choreographed dance.\n\nHer day is just like how kids play. No water in the shower or milk in the carton. No need to walk down the stairs when you can float down to the ground for a fun day at the beach. Her days are nothing and everything. When things start to change, Barbie wants nothing more than a normal day that ends, as every day ends, with a girls night.\n\nKenergy aside, a pivotal moment in “Barbie” is the monologue of Gloria (America Ferrera) about the ridiculousness of the double standards woman juggle. The original monologue was written by director Greta Gerwig with notes from Ferrera and took almost 30 takes to capture.\n\nIt’s a message that has brought viewers to tears and in the film, inspired stereotypical Barbie out of her hopelessness into action.\n\n“By giving voice to the cognitive dissonance required to be a woman under the patriarchy, you robbed it of its power,” Barbie says.\n\nThese two works give a voice to what’s unsaid: the unrealistic expectations, the mental labor of caregiving, the adjustments under the gaze. Perhaps they’re real-life thrillers about something that could save humanity."

        "text": "There are two new wide or semi-wide releases this weekend, “The Last Voyage of the Demeter” and “Jules,” but how many moviegoers will actually buy tickets with so many other stronger contenders still in theaters? Read on for Gold Derby’s box office preview.\n\nBefore we get to the new movies this week, we probably should address the “Barbenheimer” in the room. There’s very little doubt that “Barbie” can pull off a rare fourth weekend at #1 with upwards of $32 million or more after holding up so well against “Meg 2” and the “Ninja Turtles” this past weekend. Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” also has a good chance at reclaiming second place, since it’s likely to have a smaller drop-off this weekend than both of last week’s new movies.\n\nSEE Box office: ‘Barbie’ crosses $400 million mark in less than 3 weeks\n\n“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” was just two million behind “Meg 2: The Trench” over the weekend but received much better reviews and a higher CinemaScore, so we can probably expect it to hold up better and take third place, leaving fourth place for “Meg 2.”\n\nThat brings us to the first of the new wide releases, and that is Universal Pictures’ “The Last Voyage of the Demeter,” directed by André Øvredal (“Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark”). It’s based on the section of Bram Stoker’s “Dracula” where the vampire travels by ship from Romania to England to continue his reign of terror. In this case, Dracula (or “Nosferatu,” going by the 1922 silent classic starring Max Schreck) is played by creature performer and actor Javier Botet.\n\nThe crew of the Demeter – that’s the name of the ship – includes Corey Hawkins from “Straight Outta Compton” as a British doctor hoping to get a trip back home, while the captain is played by veteran actor Liam Cunningham (“Game of Thrones”) and his young son is played by Woody Norman (“C’mon C’mon”). Other known names and/or faces include David Dastmalchian (“Ant-Man,” “The Boogeyman”) as the ship’s first mate and Irish-Italian actress Aisling Franciosi (also “GoT”) as a stowaway.\n\nWhile the movie definitely has the Dracula thing going for it and being dark horror by a fairly well-respected genre filmmaker like Øvredal, it’s also a period gothic horror film, which tend to be a tougher sell to American audiences. Case in point: 2012’s “The Woman in Black,” starring Daniel Radcliffe, opened shortly after the end of his “Harry Potter” run with $20.9 million in early February; its 2015 sequel sans Radcliffe earned roughly half the original film’s domestic take. The 2018 gothic horror film “Winchester” (also from the now defunct CBS Films) opened on the same weekend as “Woman in Black” with just $9.3 million and grossed less than $46 million worldwide.\n\nSEE Grab the popcorn and sound off in our movie forums\n\nEarlier this year, the Dracula horror-comedy spin-off “Renfield,” starring Nicholas Hoult and Nicolas Cage as Dracula, bombed quite badly, opening with just $8 million, so it’s odd for Universal to be releasing another Dracula spin-off (essentially) so soon.\n\nThere’s a good chance that a movie like “Demeter” can do well in European and other international countries, but Universal is only opening the movie in roughly 2,600 North American theaters, maybe realizing it would be a tougher sell. Reviews (which won’t hit until Thursday) probably won’t be so kind for various reasons I won’t break embargo to share, but those things alone might keep “The Last Voyage of the Demeter” from opening over $10 million. Because of that, it’s likely to open in fifth place behind last week’s rejiggered top four.\n\nFilmmaker Marc Turtletaub, who received an Oscar nomination for producing “Little Miss Sunshine,” directs “Jules,” a smaller indie comedy starring Sir Ben Kingsley as a small-town Pennsylvania resident who encounters an alien after his craft crash lands in his garden. Bleecker Street Films will be releasing the movie moderately wide on Friday, also in an attempt to try to grab older adult business away from “Oppenheimer” mostly.\n\nSEE 2023 box office hits: Every movie that made more than $100 million\n\nTurtletaub previously directed the Sundance drama “Puzzle,” starring Kelly McDonald and late Bollywood great Irrfan Khan, but that movie didn’t even make $2.3 million worldwide, which is not a good sign that the producer of so many huge hits picks the best material to direct. (Turtletaub previously wrote “Gods Behaving Badly” and two short films, but he didn’t write either of his most recent features.)\n\nAlthough Kingsley probably has a decent draw with older audiences, as does his co-star, Jane Curtin, a veteran from the early days of “Saturday Night Live,” there’s no theater count reported for “Jules,” as of this writing. Without having a presence in more than 1,000 theaters, there’s no guarantee this can even get into the Top 10, making something closer to the $2 million opening for the Bleecker Street release “Mafia Mamma” earlier this year, but probably less.\n\nAlso, Cohen Media Group will give a platform release to Juliet Binoche’s latest film “Between Two Worlds,” directed by Emmanuel Carrère. Check back on Sunday to see if the new movies fare better against the late summer blockbusters.\n\nSIGN UP for Gold Derby’s free newsletter with latest predictions"

        "text": "The AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. shareholder seeking to derail the settlement over its APE units renewed her bid to halt any stock conversion for an appeal if the deal is approved.\n\nThe success of blockbusters “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” and the theater chain’s own actions belie the idea that it will be ruined by any delay in converting the preferred units to common stock, according to court papers filed Tuesday and late Monday by Rose Izzo, the retail investor leading the charge against the settlement.\n\nAMC’s “overhyped concerns and unreasonable demands ring hollow,” according to the filing in Delaware’s Chancery Court. “If defendants believe their own math, then waiting three weeks to correct a problem raised at the settlement hearing cost AMC approximately $25 million. They should welcome some preemptive action.”\n\nIn pushing to delay any conversion of the AMC Preferred Equity units, or APEs, Izzo is seeking to capitalize on Vice Chancellor Morgan T. Zurn’s ruling rejecting the original version of the settlement, which stunned analysts July 21, scrambling the trading positions of arbitragers betting on the conversion. The decision sent AMC common stock surging and the preferred units plunging.\n\nHollywood Strikes, ‘Barbenheimer’\n\nIzzo is one of the nearly 3,000 retail investors—many of them participants in the “meme stock” rally that saved the company from a pandemic-era bankruptcy—who wrote to the court to oppose the settlement. The deal, announced in April, has fluctuated in value within the $110 million to $120 million range, depending on AMC’s stock price.\n\nShe’s the only one who showed up at a June court hearing with an attorney to formally object. Her lawyer, Ted Kittila, has said he’s ready to take over the case, scuttle the agreement, and resume the court fight on behalf of investors who feel “stabbed in the back” by the company and the shareholders that negotiated the deal.\n\nZurn’s surprise ruling rejecting the settlement was a relatively narrow one. She turned the deal down over provisions—which she had flagged at the hearing three weeks earlier—that waived any claims by common stockholders, including those involving APEs they might also hold. State corporate laws require such releases to work on a share-by-share rather than investor-by-investor basis, the judge said.\n\nAMC and the lead shareholders swiftly filed a revised settlement aimed at addressing those concerns, and Zurn agreed within days to resume weighing the agreement without offering investors a new opportunity to object. Both sides stressed in court papers the importance of a ruling in the first half of August, “before the capital markets go quiet” until after Labor Day.\n\nThe company’s filing described Hollywood’s ongoing labor strikes as a “serious threat,” echoing a July 23 open letter from CEO Adam Aron stating that AMC’s “risk of financial collapse is not whimsical.” The theater chain has since been buoyed by the simultaneous blockbusters.\n\nPlaying Coy\n\nIzzo, meanwhile, has sought to ensure that her channels of appeal remain open if Zurn signs off on the revised settlement. Letting the APE conversion go through while the state’s top court is considering the case would “frustrate appellate review,” according to her court filing Tuesday.\n\n“Clawing back the settlement consideration following a successful appeal may be impossible,” Izzo said. She also pointed to the “Barbenheimer” revenues AMC is now enjoying. “The parties play coy as to why disaster is closer now,” following “unrelenting positive news,” the filing said.\n\nAlso Tuesday, another shareholder leading a separate lawsuit against AMC—one that would force the company to hold its first annual meeting and board election since June 2022—accused the company of stalling on an expedited hearing date. “This matter can and should be set for a hearing in August,” he said.\n\nIzzo is represented by is represented by Halloran Farkas & Kittila LLP. AMC is represented by Richards, Layton & Finger PA and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP. Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann LLP, Grant & Eisenhofer PA, Fields Kupka & Shukurov LLP, and Saxena White PA are counsel for the pension fund and investor leading the litigation.\n\nThe cases are In re AMC Ent. Holdings Inc. S’holder Litig., Del. Ch., No. 2023-0215, 8/1/23 and Barnes v. AMC Ent. Holdings Inc., Del. Ch., No. 2023-0718, 8/1/23."

        "text": "After three weekends in theaters, Greta Gerwig’s \"Barbie\" surpassed the $1 billion mark in global ticket sales. Gerwig became the highest grossing female director of all time, breaking a record previously held by Patty Jenkins, director of \"Wonder Woman.\"\n\nThe highly anticipated paranoia thriller, \"Oppenheimer\" was directed by Christopher Nolan and released the same weekend as \"Barbie.\" The two films collectively generated $244.5 million in North American ticket sales their opening weekend in theaters. “Barbie” brought in $162 million, followed by “Oppenheimer” at $82.5 million.\n\nThe Margot Robbie-led and produced film has been comfortably seated in first place since the film's release on July 21.\n\nMovie ticket sales are crawling back to pre-pandemic levels\n\nAccording to The Numbers, a publicly available database of movie industry statistics, annual tickets sold for 2023 are expected to reach 922 million. That's compared to 2022, where total tickets sold reached 709 million. While 2023 ticket sales are not expected to surpass 2019’s pre-pandemic levels of 1.2 billion, they’re inching closer, partially in service to the global sensation that is \"Barbenheimer.\"\n\nShawn Robbins, chief analyst at Box Office Pro, said \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" drove a huge social conversation that went above and beyond the internet. The meme of \"Barbenheimer\" caught wildfire, Robbins said. “Everybody heard about it, and everybody outside of movie circles has been talking about it for the last few weeks.” The cultural phenomenon drove non-moviegoers to the theaters, breaking significant box-office records.\n\nTheater-etiquette:Bad behavior in blockbusters sparks discussion\n\nThe 'Barbenheimer’ phenomenon:How a movie meme inspired the 'crazy, weird' double feature\n\n'Barbie' smashes box office records\n\nWhile “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” is currently the highest-grossing movie of 2023 sitting at $1.35 billion, “Barbie” is projected to beat that record. “Barbie” not only had the biggest opening weekend of 2023, but it was also the biggest opening weekend for any movie directed by a woman.\n\nDomestic box-office sales for \"Barbie\" and “Oppenheimer,\" combined were the fourth largest of all time for an opening weekend. The only bigger opening movie weekends were for “Avengers,\" \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" or “Star Wars” films.\n\n\"Barbie\" had the biggest opening week in history of any Warner Bros. film, raking in more than half a billion dollars.\n\n“Barbie stands out as one of the very few female-centric, female-targeted blockbusters of the summer,” said Robbins. \"The movie offered something fresh in a summer that’s been jam-packed with franchise sequels.\"\n\nYoung people are driving a movie-theater comeback\n\nWhile movie ticket sales and box office numbers are not back to pre-pandemic levels, industry data shows that young people are behind the growing market of moviegoers. About 80% of the \"Barbie\" audience was younger than 35. And 65% of the audience was female, according to data from Box Office Pro.\n\n“The audience driving this rebound has been young.” Robbins said. He pointed to “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” as an example of a film playing well to a younger audience.\n\nThe year-to-date domestic box office recently crossed the $6 billion mark. The last time this mark was hit in summer was in early July 2019, according to data shared by Robbins.\n\nBut keep in mind, with screenwriters and actors on strike, the movie industry is destined to feel the impact of delayed and or canceled production."

        "text": "Barbie, the doll, may be 64 years old, but “Barbie,” the movie, is a pandemic baby.\n\nGreta Gerwig, the Oscar-nominated filmmaker behind “Little Women” and “Lady Bird,” started dreaming it up at a time when she wasn’t sure movies would ever come back.\n\n“I wanted to channel something that had that ache in it, but also something so wild and unruly and something that was so just spilling out over the edges of it that you want to be in a group and see it big,” Gerwig told The Associated Press this week. “Because I thought we’ll never make any movies again, but if they’re going to, I’d like this.”\n\nHer “Barbie,” which releases in theaters on Friday, is a joyful, maximalist, deeply weird, insightful and defiantly pink confection starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. She co-wrote it with her partner, Noah Baumbach, with whom she shares two sons — a toddler and a five-month-old whom they welcomed into the world while getting “Barbie” out to the world.\n\nGerwig spoke to the AP this week about the film, the reviews, the tension between art and commerce, and the unlikely connection between “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer.” (Hint: It’s not just the release date.)\n\nRemarks have been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.AP: Reviews for “Barbie” came out (Wednesday) and are very positive. I’m wondering if you engage with those and how you’re feeling?\n\nGERWIG: I do. I mean, of course. I’m not Emily Dickinson. I’m not above anything. I didn’t actually look last night because I just knew I would be too anxious. I was like go to sleep, wake up, caffeinate, get your kid to summer camp and then find out where we are. There’s a lot of reviewers that I really respect and have really liked. Film criticism matters to me as a person and also being in conversation with people who think about cinema matters. But it can feel very scary at the moment that you’re at the emotional pitch of releasing a movie to take it in.\n\nWhat I tend to do is know which ones I’m going to go back to in a few weeks when I can take it in more. It’s too overwhelming at the moment. … All my metaphors go to giving birth because I have a five-month-old but it would be like if you just give birth and then you’re like, “What are the reviews of the baby?” But I did check the email and I’m pleased. (“Barbie”) seems to have been received in the spirit that it was meant, which is exciting.AP: I read that you called Peter Weir (“The Truman Show” director) to get advice on creating an artificial world with emotional authenticity. Is there anything he told you that you can share?\n\nGERWIG: He was so generous getting on the phone with me. I had this idea of making Barbie Land basically an interior soundstage world. That was that was the concept. But as big as soundstages are, they’re not the world. They’re going to be small. You can only hang the lights so high.\n\nThere’s obviously parts of his movie that are done on a stage, but then there are other parts of it that can’t possibly be on a stage because it’s too big, but it feels like it’s on a stage, you know? Why does it feel like it’s on a stage? He explained to me they did shoot a lot of it outside in this community in Florida, but that they hung big stage lighting everywhere so it would look lit even though it was outside. And then he said it made everything like 120 degrees and that he did not suggest that. He was like I wouldn’t do that. It works but you might want to avoid making a place that’s hot, hotter.AP: That’s great that you asked.\n\nGERWIG: In my experience, directors are so generous speaking about what they’ve done and how they did it and what were the problems, because you’re only ever on your own movie AND movies are hard and they always feel completely unlikely and completely impossible but in a new way that the other one wasn’t. Whatever lessons you learned on the last one, you can apply some of them, but it’s going to be a new set of issues. And other directors want to give you the knowledge that they’ve gotten that they can’t use anymore because they’ve already made that movie.\n\nI had the same experience when I was making “Little Women.” Steven Spielberg was incredibly generous with me because he had made “Lincoln,” which took place in the same year. He opened up all of his research, all the lighting diagrams that he did with his cinematographer. He was like here’s how we did it. He just showed me absolutely everything. Even though you’re only ever in your own in your own dream of your own movie, there’s camaraderie in the loneliness.AP: I wondered going in if “Barbie” was going to be for kids, but then about 15 minutes in I realized that this is exactly the type of movie that I wish I’d had to obsess over at age 8 instead of, like “Grease 2.”\n\nGERWIG: I’ve never thought of such a sharp delineation of like what’s for kids and for adults. I just don’t see it as church and state. There’s this Demetri Martin joke that’s like, saying you like kids is like saying, “I like people, for a little while.” We all have some sense of childhood and sense of moving out of it, too, which I think is something that I probably will be forever interested in. We’re not Merlin. We only live in one direction.AP: There’s talk of a Proust Barbie in the film, which doesn’t seem random. Could you elaborate on why you chose him?\n\nGERWIG: In “Remembrance of Things Past,” in “Swann’s Way,” he is literally thrown back into his childhood through the taste of the madeleine. I thought, well, that’ll be a nice Easter egg for one person.AP: Proust was Oppenheimer’s favorite too. I did not expect that to be the connection between these movies.\n\nGERWIG: So he would have loved Proust Barbie!AP: There’s a scene where Barbie enters the real world and is being ogled on Venice Beach and certainly it’s something a lot of women can relate to, but I wonder if that reminded you at all of your days starting out as an actor and feeling like you had to look a certain way.\n\nGERWIG: I always felt like I was just was never quite right, that I was somehow being looked at and found lacking. That’s not exclusively available for actors, I think it’s pretty universal. But it’s heightened as an actor. I did an audition once and I was wearing overalls, I think it was for a TV show, and I got into the room and the casting director looked at me and said “Well you must be very talented.” I thought, “Oh no, maybe I’m not talented enough to just be wearing overalls.” Also that this is going quite badly.AP: There’s some thematic similarities between all your films — women’s economic independence, self-actualization and the idea that emotion is not a weakness.\n\nGERWIG: With any project, I’m completely in it. I can’t really connect it to other things I’ve done. But then when I step back from it, I think, “Oh, these are connected in some way.” I think I’m just interested in the gleeful messiness of life and people. And I’m interested in women. I don’t know, I like them a lot. And I’m interested in women talking to each other through generations. The unwieldy nature of living life is not something that always has to be organized. It can kind of live in its own wildness.AP: There’s comfort in the idea that it can all be true.\n\nGERWIG: The hope of stepping into everything, was allowing it to all be equally true. I think of the character of Sasha who dismantles Barbie. I wanted everything she said to be absolutely true. And also other things that are true at the same time. That’s always the place that feels most accurate to me.AP: There was a Guardian piece, I’m not sure if you’ve read it, about indie directors “selling out.” I feel like this is related, that “Barbie” can be a Mattel movie and also a piece of legitimate art and expression as well. And also, like your characters, you’re ensuring your economic independence while getting your ideas out to the biggest audience possible.\n\nGERWIG: I haven’t read it. I’m sure they make good points, probably. There’s always some tension, obviously, between art that exists in the world to be seen and consumed. I joked at the beginning that I’m not Emily Dickinson, but I really am not Emily Dickinson. I’m not writing poems on the back of envelopes and creating and destroying worlds from the confines of my home and never letting anybody see it. I’m making art to be seen by people.\n\nI am not comparing myself to this person at all, but one of the first things when I was a kid was (Sacramento’s) version of Shakespeare in the Park. I got to be part of it when I was 11. I had one line but I loved it, I would go backstage and just watch everyone. It was “The Merry Wives of Windsor,” which was created because the fans liked the character of Falstaff. That’s true. He was a fan favorite in “Henry IV” and, like, someone said could you write a play that’s like, a spinoff. And Shakespeare was like, you got it. And it’s amazing. And it’s also a spinoff of a character. I’m not saying I’m like Shakespeare, but I do think that sort of tension is part of what I like about all of it. We all live in this mess. Except for Emily Dickinson. But she’s the only one."

        "text": "HANOI, July 3 (Reuters) - Vietnam has banned Warner Bros' highly-anticipated film \"Barbie\" from domestic distribution over a scene featuring a map that shows China's unilaterally claimed territory in the South China Sea, state media reported on Monday.\n\nThe U-shaped \"nine-dash line\" is used on Chinese maps to illustrate its claims over vast areas of the South China Sea, including swathes of what Vietnam considers its continental shelf, where it has awarded oil concessions.\n\n\"Barbie\" is the latest movie to be banned in Vietnam for depicting China's controversial nine-dash line, which was repudiated in an international arbitration ruling by a court in The Hague in 2016. China refuses to recognise the ruling.\n\nIn 2019 the Vietnamese government pulled DreamWorks' animated film \"Abominable\" and last year it banned Sony's action movie \"Unchartered\" for the same reason. Netflix also removed an Australian spy drama \"Pine Gap\" in 2021.\n\n[1/2]Actor Margot Robbie is photographed during a photocall for the upcoming Warner Bros. film \"Barbie\" in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 25, 2023.

        "text": "As we bide our time until opening night, EW has compiled everything you need to know about the cast of Barbie.\n\nSomething must have changed along the way because nearly everyone involved with the production of Barbie seems to agree that Gerwig's interpretation of the iconic character is both feminist and funny.\n\nThough Amy Schumer was originally attached to develop Mattel's signature feature, the comedian left the project when it was clear that executives at Mattel didn't see eye-to-eye with her feminist vision. \"They definitely didn't want to do it the way I wanted to do it, the only way I was interested in doing it,\" she told Andy Cohen on an episode of Watch What Happens Live.\n\nIt's quite possibly the most anticipated film of the year so far. Greta Gerwig 's Barbie , starring Margot Robbie as the eponymous doll and Ryan Gosling as Ken, finally arrives in theaters on July 21, 2023, after spending the better part of a decade in development. Gerwig's involvement was first announced in 2019, marking the 60th anniversary of Barbie herself.\n\n01 of 24 Margot Robbie (Barbie) Han Myung-Gu/WireImage, Warner Brothers Margot Robbie began acting in her native Australia on the soap Neighbors and rose to international fame with her barnstorming turn in Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), followed by playing Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad (2016), James Gunn's superior sequel The Suicide Squad (2021), and Cathy Yan's invigorating Birds of Prey (2020). She soon earned two Oscar nominations for her brilliant turn as Tonya Harding in I, Tonya (2017) and her role in Bombshell (2019) before turning heads as Sharon Tate in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. In 2022, Robbie starred in an absolute mess called Amsterdam, as well as the similarly maximalist Babylon. More recently, she played a small but pivotal role in Wes Anderson's delightful, thoughtfully constructed Asteroid City (2023). Robbie has been married to producer Tom Ackerley since 2016. The couple met on the set of the 2014 film Suite Française, and founded LuckyChap Entertainment together the following year. Along with Barbie, the company has produced her costar Emerald Fennell's Promising Young Woman and I, Tonya, as well as the Netflix series Maid (2021) and upcoming spins on Ocean's 11 and Tank Girl. (Rejoice!) As for why she signed on to play Barbie, Robbie cited the casting as part of her motivation. \"I don't think I would have wanted to attempt to make a Barbie film if there wasn't a wide diversity of Barbies and Kens,\" she told Time. \"I don't think you should say, 'This is the one version of what Barbie is, and that's what women should aspire to be and look like and act like.'\"\n\n02 of 24 Ryan Gosling (Ken) Mathew Tsang/Getty, Warner Brothers Former Mouseketeer Ryan Gosling got his first acting credit on a 1995 episode of Are You Afraid of the Dark? Since then, the actor has carved a spacious nook for himself on the top shelf of Hollywood. His most notable works include the classic weepy The Notebook (2004), his Oscar-nominated turn in Half Nelson (2006), Lars and the Real Girl (2007), Blue Valentine, the neo-noir action-thriller Drive, George Clooney's Ides of March, and the romantic comedy Crazy, Stupid, Love. Gosling generated further buzz by headlining Adam McKay's The Big Short (2015) and the refreshing comedy The Nice Guys (2016) before earning another Oscar nom for singing and dancing his way through La La Land with Emma Stone and cruising through Blade Runner 2049 in 2017. He then took a four-year break to spend more time with his wife, Eva Mendes (whom he met on the set of The Place Beyond the Pines in 2011), and their two daughters. The actor currently has four projects in development, including the update of The Fall Guy and Margot Robbie's purported Ocean's 11 prequel. Playing Ken has given Gosling a new respect for the character, who the actor has found himself defending as of late. \"It is funny, this kind of clutching-your-pearls idea of, like, #notmyken,\" he told GQ in May 2023. \"Like you ever thought about Ken before this?… No, you didn't. You never did. You never cared.\" Gosling continued: \"If you ever really cared about Ken, you would know that nobody cared about Ken. So your hypocrisy is exposed. This is why his story must be told.\"\n\n03 of 24 Michael Cera (Allan) Jon Kopaloff/Getty, Warner Brothers Michael Cera grew up in Canada and made a name for himself as George-Michael Bluth, Jason Bateman's awkward teenage son, on Arrested Development (2003–2018). He went on to appear in 2007's Superbad and Juno, Nick and Nora' Infinite Playlist (2008), Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010), and as \"himself\" in This Is the End (2013). He has since appeared on Broadway in the Kenneth Lonergan plays Lobby Hero (2018), for which he received a Tony nomination for Best Featured Actor, and The Waverly Gallery (2018). Cera is also a musician, having contributed to the soundtracks of both Scott Pilgrim and Nick and Nora, as well as mandolin and backing vocals to the Weezer track \"Hang On.\" His song \"Best I Can,\" featuring Sharon Van Etten, was nominated for a 2017 Critics' Choice Award for Best Song Featured in a Documentary, though his 2014 cover of \"Clay Pigeons\" by Blaze Foley remains his most popular musical work to date. In 2022, Cera revealed that he is a father to a young son with his wife, Nadine.\n\n04 of 24 Will Ferrell (Mattel CEO) Dominik Bindl/WireImage, Warner Brothers After a tenure on some of the most fruitful seasons of Saturday Night Live, Will Ferrell segued into a successful acting and producing career in television and film. Along with Adam McKay, Ferrell created some of the most enduring comedies of the 21st century: Anchorman, Talladega Nights, Step Brothers, and The Other Guys. Another noteworthy Ferrell flick is Blades of Glory (2006), where he and Jon Heder star as disgraced figure skaters. Ferrell has also been successful in more dramatic roles, namely in films Everything Must Go (2010) and Downhill (2020). Through his and McKay's Gary and Gloria Sanchez Productions, Ferrell has produced Eastbound and Down, Booksmart (2019), Hustlers (2019), Dead to Me, Succession, and The Menu (2022). Ferrell has been married to Viveca Paulin, with whom he has three children, since 2000. As for his role as the CEO of Mattel, the company behind the real-life Barbie doll, Ferrell has been singing his praises for the anticipated blockbuster. \"It is, in my humble opinion, the ultimate example of high art and low art,\" Ferrell told WSJ. Magazine. \"It's a loving homage to the brand and, at the same time, couldn't be more satirical — just an amazing comment on male patriarchy and women in society and why Barbie's criticized and yet why every little girl still wants to play with Barbie. Boy, when I read it, I was like, 'This is fantastic.'\"\n\n05 of 24 Helen Mirren (Narrator) Daniele Venturelli/Getty, Warner Brothers One of the most celebrated and decorated actors of all time, Helen Mirren boasts a staggering amount of credits to her name. She rose to acclaim in The Long Good Friday (1980) and Excalibur (1981). Mirren then won an Oscar for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II in The Queen (2006), and has taken on action-hero roles in Red (2010) and its 2013 sequel, along with 2023's Shazam: Fury of the Gods. Other notable credits include films Gosford Park (2001) and Hitchcock (2012). Mirren will soon appear in the biopic Golda, in which she plays former Israeli prime minister Golda Meir. Mirren has known Gerwig since they starred together in the entirely forgotten 2011 remake of Arthur, so the veteran actor jumped at the opportunity to be a part of Barbie. \"We formed a bond together, Mirren told Vanity Fair. \"She's an amazing visionary and an extraordinary talent.\" Though she voices the narrator, whether or not she'll appear on screen in the finished film is still a mystery. \"I did shoot an appearance, but whether that's gotten to stay in the movie, I don't know.\" Mirren has been married to director Taylor Hackford (Ray) since 1997.\n\n06 of 24 Kate McKinnon (Weird Barbie) CHRIS DELMAS/AFP via Getty, Warner Brothers Former Saturday Night Live MVP Kate McKinnon has stolen scenes in the films Masterminds (2016), Paul Feig's Ghostbusters (2016), Rough Night (2017), and The Spy Who Dumped Me (2018). In 2019, she starred in Danny Boyle's Yesterday and opposite Margot Robbie in Bombshell. As for television, McKinnon won two Emmys for SNL, has done voicework for Family Guy and The Simpsons, and starred in the underwhelming miniseries Joe vs. Carole, based on the infamous feud in Netflix's Tiger King. She's currently filming Andrew Stanton's sci-fi flick In the Blink of an Eye. When speaking to Fandango about her thoughts after reading the Barbie script, McKinnon shared her appreciation for the fact that it explores how \"gender roles deny people half their humanity,\" adding that it's a \"very powerful message.\"\n\n07 of 24 Issa Rae (President Barbie) James Gourley/Getty, Warner Brothers Issa Rae first became known through her 2011 web series Awkward Black Girl. In 2016, HBO began airing Ray's debut television show Insecure, which garnered critical acclaim and 14 Emmy nominations (plus a win for editing) across its five seasons. During that time, she also started in the 2019 film Little alongside Regina Hall. Rae appeared opposite Kumail Nanjiani in the chaotic rom-com The Lovebirds (2020), and had a small role in B.J. Novak's exceptional thriller Vengeance (2022). In 2023, Rae voiced Spider-Woman in the massive hit Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Rae voiced her belief that Gerwig's approach to her cast and crew led to the overall harmony on set. \"She collaborates with people whose opinions she values, and she wants to make sure that she's hearing everyone out,\" Rae said. \"She's so great about funneling those thoughts through her own vision and heightening and elevating them…Everyone had versions of how they wanted their Barbies or Kens to be, and I saw her take those ideas and make them her own in the best possible way.\"\n\n08 of 24 America Ferrera (Gloria) Han Myung-Gu/WireImage, Warner Brothers Superstore and Ugly Betty star America Ferrera plays a real-world character in Barbie who befriends the dolls when they arrive from Barbie Land. Ferrera's first film appearance was in Real Women Have Curves (2002), and she quickly netted more starring roles in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (2005) and its 2008 sequel, along with Lords of Dogtown (2005), a voice role in the How to Train Your Dragon films, and an unrecognizable turn in End of Watch (2012). Ferrera revealed on an episode of The Kelly Clarkson Show that she decided to wear a particularly fashionable outfit to the Barbie cast sleepover at the swanky Claridge's Hotel in London. \"Nobody told me that it was sexy Barbie sleepover,\" Ferrera protested. \"So everybody was in like, really pretty silky nightgowns and I was in the most grandma floral twin set you could imagine.\"\n\n09 of 24 Simu Liu (Ken) Kevin Mazur/Getty, Warner Brothers Canadian native Simu Liu had roles on shows such as Pacific Rim (2012), Orphan Black (2013–2017), Blood and Water (2015), Kim's Convenience (2016–2021), Taken (2017), and Slasher (2016–present) before he joined the MCU as the titular hero in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021). That same year, he hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live. Liu joined his other Barbie cast members in praising their director while speaking to Vanity Fair in 2022. \"I remember very clearly about some of our big intricate dance sequences. Greta was very, very conscientious about who she cast,\" he said. \"We were able to cast people of different shapes, sizes, differently abled, to all participate in this dance — all under this message of: 'You don't have to be blonde, white, or X, Y, Z in order to embody what it means to be a Barbie or a Ken.'\"\n\n10 of 24 Kingsley Ben-Adir (Ken) PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty, Warner Brothers British actor Kingsley Ben-Adir got his start on the London stage before transitioning into television and film. He starred opposite Zoë Kravitz in Hulu's High Fidelity series adaptation and as Malcolm X in Regina King's One Night in Miami… (2020). Currently, Ben-Adir can be seen with Samuel L. Jackson in Marvel's Disney+ series Secret Invasion. Other noteworthy credits include Peaky Blinders, The OA, and King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. Ben-Adir told Variety he had no second thoughts about joining the production. \"From the first page, I was like, 'Wow, this is really, really funny!'... Then me and Greta went out for some whiskey. We spoke for two or three hours. There was a really strong sense from early on like she was trying to do something a little bit different,\" he said. \"It's very rare that a script like that comes along. So I was like, 'Whatever, whoever is in it, I just want to be on set with those guys and I want to be a part of it.'\"\n\n11 of 24 Ritu Arya (Journalist Barbie) Roy Rochlin/Getty, Warner Brothers Ritu Arya started acting through guest spots on British series such as Sherlock and Doctor Who before she landed a part in Paul Feig's Last Christmas (2019). That same year, she joined The Umbrella Academy in a lead role as Lila Pitts. She went on to appear in five episodes of Feel Good (2020) and the raucous action comedy Red Notice (2021) alongside Ryan Reynolds and Dwyane Johnson, and in 2023 starred in the inspired genre mash-up Polite Society.\n\n12 of 24 Alexandra Shipp (Writer Barbie) Michael Buckner/Variety via Getty, Warner Brothers Alexandra Shipp rose to prominence by playing the late singer Aaliyah in Lifetime's biopic Aaliyah: The Princess of R&B (2014). She took over the role of Storm for Halle Berry in X-Men: Apocalypse (2016), which she reprised for Deadpool 2 in 2018 and in 2019's Dark Phoenix. Additionally, Shipp starred in the slasher satire Tragedy Girls (2017), Straight Outta Compton (2015), and Shaft (2019). More recently, she appeared in the bio-thriller Silk Road and alongside Andrew Garfield in Tick, Tick… Boom! in 2021. Like many other cast members, Shipp has praised Gerwig for encouraging each actor not to over-train for their role. \"Greta was really excited about everybody looking the way that Barbies should look, which is every shape and size,\" Shipp told Interview. \"I saw some of the film last week and it's really beautiful to see us all together looking like a gaggle of girls, but also a gaggle of dolls.\"\n\n13 of 24 Nicola Coughlan (Diplomat Barbie) Alexandre Schneider/Getty , Warner Brothers Before she was synonymous with the role of Penelope Featherington on Bridgerton, Nicola Coughlan starred as Clare Devlin in the stellar dramatic comedy Derry Girls (2018–2022). She's also appeared on the Hulu series Harlots, and will star alongside Nick Frost in the upcoming comedy Seize Them! \"Oh my God, I'd be so, so happy,\" Coughlan told PEOPLE when asked how her teenage self would view her success today. She elaborated that her career is \"what I've always wanted — and I think something about it happening to me not in my 20s, it makes me look at it with a different lens, and I appreciate it so much.\"\n\n14 of 24 Emerald Fennell (Midge) Dave Benett/Getty, Warner Brothers Actress, writer, and director Emerald Fennell is set to appear in Barbie as a non-Barbiefied character named Midge. After spending several seasons on Call the Midwife, her role as Camilla Parker Bowles on The Crown brought Fennell to international prominence. As for film, she appeared in The Danish Girl (2015), in Joe Wright's Anna Karenina (2012), and Pan (2015). In 2020, Fennell wrote and directed Promising Young Woman, a positively searing film that was nominated for multiple Oscars and earned Fennell a win for Best Original Screenplay. Her other notable writing credits include six episodes of Killing Eve and the short film Careful How You Go (2018).\n\n15 of 24 Sharon Rooney (Lawyer Barbie) Karwai Tang/WireImage, Warner Brothers Scottish stand-up comedian Sharon Rooney began her career on stage before netting roles in Scarlett Johansson's alien tone poem Under the Skin (2015), Dumbo (2019), and The Electrical Life of Louis Wain (2021). She also starred on the TV series My Mad Fat Diary and Finding Alice (2021). Rooney told Scottish outlet Daily Record about her positive takeaways from the Barbie set. \"I think what Barbie's taught me is that you can do anything and be everything because she's a woman who — literally — does everything,\" she said. \"I'd really love to write something of my own. I see how clever Greta is and how wonderful she is and such an amazing actress, but she also is a phenomenal director. And Margot as well, she's an outrageously brilliant actress, but she's also got a fantastic production company.\"\n\n16 of 24 Dua Lipa (Mermaid Barbie) Cindy Ord/MG23/Getty, Warner Brothers London-born pop star Dua Lipa jump-started her career by posting covers of popular songs on YouTube. She released her first single, \"New Love,\" in 2015. Two years later, the artist issued her self-titled debut album, featuring hits \"New Rules\" and \"Be the One.\" Her second studio album, Future Nostalgia, represented a jump forward in her work with its airy, disco-dotted sound. She's since won three Grammys, including Best New Artist in 2019. Lipa has recorded new music for Barbie — along with Charli XCX, Haim, Ice Spice, Lizzo, Tame Impala, and even Ryan Gosling — and is currently working on her next solo studio album. Barbie is her first acting role, though she has a part in Matthew Vaughn's film Argylle coming in 2024.\n\n17 of 24 Hari Nef (Doctor Barbie) Pierre Suu/WireImage, Warner Brothers Hari Nef starred in the biographical drama Mapplethorpe and Sam Levinson's Assassination Nation in 2018, along with the comedies 1Up and Meet Cute. She's also appeared in episodes of Transparent, the controversial Max series The Idol, and the Sex and the City revival And Just Like That…\" Nef landed her role in Barbie after posting an open letter to Gerwig and Robbie on social media expressing her ambivalence for the term \"doll\" as a transgender woman. \"Identity politics and cinema aren't my favorite combination, but the name BARBIE looms large over every American woman,\" Nef wrote. \"Barbie's the standard; she's The Girl; she's certainly THE doll. 'Doll' is fraught, glamorous; she is, and she isn't. We call ourselves 'the dolls' in the face of everything we know we are, never will be, hope to be. We yell the word because the word matters. And no doll matters more than Barbie.\"\n\n18 of 24 Emma Mackey (Physicist Barbie) Antoine Flament/Getty, Warner Brothers Despite her roles in high-profile movies such as Death on the Nile (2022), the Gothic drama Emily (2023), and the dramedy series Sex Education, Emma Mackey marks being on the set of Barbie the highlight of her career thus far. \"It was the most fun I've ever had in my life. It was wonderful. It's being helmed by people who know what they're doing and who care and who are in the best possible circumstances to do their job,\" Mackey told Total Film. \"When they're in their element, and you see other people confident and calm in what they're doing, then you feel competent and calm, and you want to make them proud and you want to do the best job possible. It's all a very healthy work environment to be in. Those opportunities don't come by all the time so you've got to take them when you can.\"\n\n19 of 24 Ncuti Gatwa (Ken) Taylor Hill/WireImage, Warner Brothers Mackey's Sex Education costar Ncuti Gatwa — who currently serves as the Fifteenth Doctor on the long-running sci-fi darling Doctor Who — was cast in Barbie after Mackey, though he told Elle she kept his casting a secret until he had secured the role. \"...She knew I was going to be in the film because my name was in the script already,\" Gatwa said. \"She kept it a secret for a month! When I found out I got the part I called her singing the Aqua 'Barbie' song.\" As for reuniting with Mackey, Gatwa felt it to be a blessing. \"We had just had such an intense five years together where we all became so close. We love each other so much and it's incredibly exciting seeing everyone go off and do their own things, but to be able to come back together? That's a magical experience.\"\n\n20 of 24 Ana Cruz Kayne (Supreme Court Justice Barbie) Gabriele Holtermann/UPI/Shutterstock, Warner Brothers Ana Cruz Kayne has an impressive list of credits to her name, including the inventive sci-fi film Another Earth (2011), the CBS crime drama series Bull, Louis C.K.'s sitcom Louie, the Tom Selleck drama Blue Bloods, and the upcoming Netflix series Painkiller. She also appeared in Gerwig's brilliant adaptation of Little Women (2019). Kayne took particular pleasure in bringing visibility to the Barbie universe. \"It was just so powerful to get to sit there as a woman of color, as the head of the Supreme Court,\" Kayne told The Messenger. \"It was everything you'd hope for. And because it's Barbie, it's power with a wink. So it felt very fitting.\"\n\n21 of 24 John Cena (Merman Ken) Michael Tran/FilmMagic Former professional wrestler John Cena is tied with Ric Flair for the most world championship reigns within the WWE. In the last 10 years, Cena has also become an ever-present actor, proving his comedy chops in Judd Apatow's Trainwreck (2015) and the raunchy comedy Blockers (2018) while also playing a villain in Bumblebee (2018). Cena later joined both The Suicide Squad (a role which he reprised in Max's Peacemaker series) and the Toretto family in F9: The Fast Hour (2021) and Fast X (2023). He also hosts the game show Wipeout alongside Nicole Byer. Cena has been married to Shay Shariatzadeh since October 2020. Cena revealed on the Today show that he actually pitched himself for the role \"in an accidental run-in with Margot Robbie.\" Reportedly, Cena told Robbie that he \"will do, pretty much, whatever you guys need 'cause I really enjoy the movie. And they asked me if I wanted to be a merman.\"\n\n22 of 24 Connor Swindells (Mattel Intern) Stuart C. Wilson/Getty, Warner Brothers Yet another star of Sex Education, Connor Swindells has also appeared in the miniseries Vigil (2021) and SAS: Rogue Heroes (2022-present). His film appearances include The Vanishing (2019) opposite Gerard Butler and the Jane Austen adaptation Emma (2020).\n\n23 of 24 Scott Evans (Ken) Kevin Winter/Getty, Warner Brothers Scott Evans has appeared in an enviable list of features, including The Lovely Bones (2009), Confessions of a Shopaholic (2009), and Almost Love (2020), and the TV series Grace and Frankie and White Collar. Having not appeared in any summer blockbusters up until this point, Evans couldn't believe the opportunity when he was cast in Barbie. \"I would say 'lost it' is a very big understatement!\" Scott told ET Online. \"When I found out that I got it, it was kind of just like a moment of processing and then it was a moment of, 'I have to go, I have people to call!' Oh my God, the first day of shooting, I was looking around the room. I'm like, 'OK, I know every single person in this room. Do I belong?'\""

        "text": "It’s time to make your childhood dreams come true, because Barbie’s Dreamhouse has mysteriously surfaced high in the hills of Malibu, Calif.—and you can stay there overnight.\n\nThe listing on Airbnb has been posted by none other than Ken himself, who says that while Barbie is \"away\" this summer she has handed over the keys to her kingdom.\n\nBookings for the giant pink property—complete with a life-sized pool, workout area and ocean views—will open on July 17 for a single night stay.\n\nThe listing adds the dream sleepover for two guests is free, explaining: \"Ken’s thing is beach, not math.\"\n\nThe Airbnb post comes as the viral marketing campaign for the Barbie movie continues to ramp up ahead of the film's debut on July 21.\n\nChildren's toy brand and Barbie maker Mattel has enjoyed renewed interest since the Greta Gerwig-directed movie was announced—resulting in a flurry of new brand collaborations and merchandise being announced.\n\nAmong the launches include a themed X-box console, a shoe collection with footwear brand Aldo, a collaboration with homeware designer brand Ruggable, official Barbie skates from Impala, as well as toothbrushes, suitcases and more.\n\nMarketeers for the movie have also moved into the experience market, with Warner Bros set to host a Barbie Boat Cruise in Boston at the end of June.\n\nThe disco dance floor in the DreamHouse.\n\nInside Ken's room\n\nThe outdoor sofa area\n\nThe rooftop terrace with a beach view\n\nEntering dreamland\n\nHow much of Barbie's reported $100 million budget is being devoted to marketing initiatives like the DreamHouse remains to be seen—and when it comes to the Airbnb listing there's also a twist.\n\nAlthough the house is decked out in the \"iconic\" pink of the fictional doll character—brought to life in the film by Margot Robbie—it's actually her male counterpart Ken playing host.\n\nThe DreamHouse has been decorated \"Ken's Way\" with the bedroom decked out in cowboy paraphernalia and a rollerblade rink added to the outside space.\n\nThe listing explains Ken—played by Ryan Gosling in the movie—has added \"a few touches to bring some much-needed Kenergy to the newly renovated and iconic Malibu DreamHouse.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe DreamHouse offer is also not a competition, the listing explicitly states, people merely need to log in to Airbnb at 10 a.m. PDT on July 17 to be in with a chance to book one of the two stays on offer.\n\nWhile staying at the property—which is based on the famous Mattel doll house design—guests can also enjoy a couple of Ken's favorite activities.\n\nThese include \"learning a line dance or two on Ken’s outdoor disco dance floor or performing a sunset serenade on Ken’s guitar\", \"taking a spin through Ken’s awesome wardrobe\" and \"challenging their fellow guests to a 'beach off'\"—which seems to be simply sunbathing.\n\nAnd whoever manages to land the DreamHouse stay will also be taking home some of that famous merch, with the listing adding the guests will be \"taking home a piece of the Kendom with their very own set of yellow-and-pink Impala skates and surfboards.\"\n\nIt's not the first time the creators behind the Barbie movie have given a glimpse into how much work it takes to bring a toy house to life. Margot Robbie showed Architectural Digest around the DreamHouse set, revealing everything from a multi-story slide to an intricately designed wardrobe.\n\nInside Ken's room\n\nInside Ken's room\n\nThe outdoor gym\n\nThe barbecue area\n\nAbout the house\n\nThe house is built across three different floors and has a slide leading from the first floor to the ground floor lawn.\n\nIn the middle of the property is a disco-themed roller rink, overlooking an infinity pool, outdoor sofa area and Malibu beach.\n\nKen's bedroom opens up onto the lawn and pool, and is kitted out with cowboy-themed decor as well as a wardrobe ready to be raided by the guests.\n\nAn outdoor gym and pink-covered barbecue station is in the garden, as well as a rooftop hangout spot with a telescope to look out over the ocean.\n\nOf course Barbie has no need to eat while she's in residence so there is no fully-functioning kitchen on the site, but thankfully for the Airbnb guests catering comes with the trip.\n\nThe roller rink—with a disco ball hanging overhead—looks out over the sea and has a light-up floor and DJ booth ready for guests to dance the night away.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nMore from Fortune:\n\n5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home\n\nLooking to make extra cash?

        "text": "This surely wasn’t the kind of publicity that Greta Gerwig’s Barbie was hoping for. The long-awaited film adaptation of the Mattel doll made headlines when, two weeks before its July 21 theatrical debut, it was banned in, of all places, Vietnam. And not because of any explicit violence or plastic nudity, but for violating the country’s territorial sovereignty.\n\nThe controversy concerns a map of the “real world” that appears when Margot Robbie’s Barbie is told she must leave Barbieland and enter the real world after her perfectly arched feet have inexplicably turned flat. Shown for only a split second, the map looks as if it were drawn by a child — one who likes bright colors and has failed geography class. Among a mess of shapes and scribbles, one oddly specific detail stood out to reviewers from Vietnam’s National Film Evaluation Council: a dotted, U-shaped trail crossing into the ocean from what’s supposed to be China.\n\nAs far as the council is concerned, this is no ordinary doodle, but a clear and deliberate representation of the so-called nine-dash line: a maritime boundary demarcating Beijing’s contested ownership of the South China Sea. The line has been featured on Chinese maps since the 1940s and, despite being rejected by the International Court of Justice in The Hague in 2016, is still used today to justify the expansion of China’s naval presence in the region, its construction of artificial islands, and its intimidation of foreign fishermen.\n\n“To the Chinese, the nine-dash line signifies their legitimate claims to the South China Sea,” Peter Zinoman, a professor of history and Southeast Asian studies at UC Berkeley and author of The Colonial Bastille: A History of Imprisonment in Vietnam, 1862-1940, tells Vox. “To the Vietnamese, it symbolizes a brazen act of imperialist bullying that elevates Chinese national interest over an older shared set of interests of socialist brotherhood.” For this reason, Barbie will not be screening in Vietnamese theaters.\n\nTo some extent, however, the damage has already been done. “As if the balancing act of stoking and restraining domestic nationalism wasn’t hard enough,” NYU professor and historian of modern Vietnam Kevin Li tells Vox, “pressure from an outside voice actively calling the government’s legitimacy into question on territorial grounds complicates things further. The Republic of Vietnam had, after all, fought the Chinese for [the South China Sea] during the last years of the Vietnam War. In my view, banning [Barbie] was a no-brainer.”\n\nThe film has also raised security concerns in Washington, where politicians doubt the Warner Bros. Film Group’s assertion that the map’s resemblance to the nine-dash line was purely accidental. “While it may just be a Barbie map in a Barbie world,” Mike Gallagher, a Republican representative of Wisconsin leading the House’s China committee, told Politico, “the fact that a cartoonish, crayon-scribbled map seems to go out of its way to depict the PRC’s unlawful territorial claims illustrates the pressure that Hollywood is under to please CCP censors.”\n\nIt’s no secret that American studios cater to China and its $4.6 billion film industry — they have been doing so for over two decades, at times to great success. However, the nature of their partnership is changing. The way it used to work, Wall Street Journal reporter Erich Schwartzel tells Vox, “Hollywood producers would bend over backward to appeal to Chinese audiences. If they thought casting a Chinese actor in a small role or filming certain scenes in China would help sell tickets there, they would do that.” Think Disney adding a panda character to the Chinese release of Zootopia, or Transformers 4: Age of Extinction being partially set in Hong Kong and starring Li Bingbing and Han Geng in addition to a host of extras selected through a Chinese reality show.\n\n“That kind of reverse engineering has died down,” adds Schwartzel, who wrote a book on the subject titled Red Carpet: Hollywood, China, and the Global Battle for Cultural Supremacy. “Now, it’s more about not including anything in your movie that risks angering the state.” This explains why Doctor Strange changed the ethnicity of the Ancient One, a spiritual leader living in a mountainous monastery, from Tibetan to Caucasian, why Bohemian Rhapsody removed all references to Freddie Mercury being gay, and why Top Gun: Maverick originally removed the Taiwanese flag from Pete Mitchell’s flight jacket. (It reappeared after protests from fans and the departure of investor Tencent; as a result, the film never played in China.)\n\nStill, there is an important difference between, say, turning a film’s antagonist from Chinese to North Korean, as was done in the 2012 Red Dawn remake, and displaying a map that recognizes Beijing’s highly disputed control over the vast majority of the South China Sea. As the theatrical world shrinks, the CCP’s control over Chinese society tightens, and the cooling of US-China relationship complicates international business relations, we might soon end up in a reality where — in addition to removing content that offends Beijing —Hollywood will “go out of its way,” as Gallagher had put it, to insert content affirming the party’s worldview.\n\n“Aiming for the PRC market, they are ready to accept the PRC’s view of geography. Disinformation works by repetition.”\n\nThis, many believe, was the case for Barbie. “The producers of the movie clearly hope it will be a blockbuster,” Hue-Tam Ho Tai, professor of Sino-Vietnamese history at Harvard University, tells Vox. “Aiming for the PRC market, they are ready to accept the PRC’s view of geography. Disinformation works by repetition.” It’s worth noting Barbie has already been approved to screen in China, and that manufacturer Mattel has a vested interest in selling its dolls there.\n\nOf course, affirming the CCP worldview comes at a cost. Barbie isn’t the first film to reference the nine-dash line, nor is it the first to be banned in Southeast Asia for doing so. Before surfacing in Barbieland, the line could be discovered in scenes from DreamWorks’ animated family film Abominable, Sony’s live-action adaptation of the video game series Uncharted starring Tom Holland, and an Australian spy drama streaming on Netflix called Pine Gap. Earlier this year, Vietnam even blacklisted John Wick: Chapter 4 for starring Donnie Yen, who is a vocal supporter of CCP policies. (John Wick was briefly available in China but has since been pulled from its platforms alongside other movies with Keanu Reeves after the actor attended a Tibet-related concert.)\n\nSoon, Hollywood will also be facing resistance from the US government, which up until this point has remained largely offscreen. Alarmed by Beijing’s influence over American entertainment, the Pentagon recently announced in a Defense Department document that it will no longer share its bases, ships, and equipment with productions that allow Beijing “to censor the content of the project in a material manner to advance the national interest of the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nSchwartzel suggests it is economic incentive, not political pressure, that could ultimately push Hollywood out of China altogether. As time goes by, breaking into the country’s film market has only gotten more difficult. This is partly due to censorship, but also because of cultural barriers. “Chinese audiences were always much savvier than Hollywood believed them to be,” he says. “A panda in Zootopia is nice, but it is not the real reason people are going to see it.” The same applies to casting Chinese actors in small, forgettable roles, which in China are mockingly referred to as “flower vases.”\n\nThen there’s competition from Chinese cinema, which has grown incredibly sophisticated over the past decade or so. In 2011, Transformers: Dark of the Moon was the highest-grossing film in China. Ten years later, in 2021, it was The Battle at Lake Changjin, a historical action epic about the People’s Volunteer Army’s unlikely victory over the US Armed Forces in a major battle during the Korean War. Commissioned by the PRC’s Central Propaganda Department, it brought in an estimated $903 million against an impressive $200 million budget — numbers Hollywood can only dream of at the moment.\n\nWhile the past and present prevalence of Chinese propaganda in American entertainment poses a significant danger for Americans, who may not always recognize it when it’s in front of them, the situation is even worse for countries not powerful enough to confront China head-on."

        "text": "Greta Gerwig breathes life into the iconic Barbie doll with her upcoming film Barbie, premiering in theaters on July 21. Starring Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, the movie has been gaining attention for its strong marketing campaign, which includes partnerships with Airbnb; Crocs; Burger King; and many other food, clothing, accessory, furniture and household product brands. The film also uses Barbie’s long trajectory as a toy and brand to reflect on issues of gender, feminism, body image and the American dream.\n\n\n\nTo understand more about Barbie’s world, Dustin Kidd, professor of sociology in the College of Liberal Arts, and Sheri Lambert, professor marketing in Fox School of Business, answer questions about who Barbie is and what she represents in American culture.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nThe way that the Barbie doll has changed over the years reflects the way that women’s role in American society has changed.\n\nBarbie’s marketing strategy is unique in that the movie is being marketed directly to women and has partnered with a large number of other brands.\n\nBarbie’s presence in the imagination of Americans of all ages makes her primed for projections of ideas about feminism, but also for brand partnerships.\n\nWhat does the Barbie doll say about American culture?\n\nOver the past few decades, the concept of the American dream has shifted from a story about hard work and achievement to a story about consumerism and having it all. Work is ephemeral, which is why Barbie is easily imagined within a host of different careers. If the owner of a Barbie doll wants to shift their Barbie’s career from doctor to rock ‘n’ roll singer (ignoring the fact that Barbie is supposedly 19), they need only buy another outfit or another doll.\n\n–Dustin Kidd\n\nBarbie has been on a growth curve. She’s grown up, just like the women of 2023. She’s fearless, she’s going out into the real world. That wasn’t the case for Barbie in the ’70s when I was playing with her as a kid—Barbie was unrealistic, in terms of her physical attributes, which are unattainable for any real person, but also emotionally. But now Barbie sends a message that little girls can be whoever they want, whether that’s a doctor, astronaut, whatever. The Barbie brand has done a good job of keeping up with changes in expectations of women over the years, and they’ve put it on steroids for women in 2023, saying that they can be fearless, they can truly do anything.\n\n–Sheri Lambert\n\nWhat does the marketing of the Barbie movie say about American culture?\n\nIt says that we like hype. We like themed things. What the Barbie brand has done is incredible—they’ve built so much excitement and there are so many collaborations with other brands, like washable rugs, Gap, nail polish, couches, everything. Everything is pink.\n\n–Sheri Lambert\n\nWhat is special about the way that the Barbie movie has been marketed to the public?\n\nIt’s special in that big blockbuster movies aren’t usually marketed to women. The film industry (and the auto industry) doesn’t market to women well, but it’s time that they market more to women because women have so much buying power. So Barbie is glomming on to the female target, and the female market is going to buy this brand. And they’re also going to take kids to this movie, and it’s great that it’s fun for men, too. The marketing of Barbie is also special because they’re selling two brands at once: the movie and the toy. And they’ve marketed it so that they’re collaborating and selling both at once.\n\n–Sheri Lambert\n\nWhy is there so much interest in the Barbie movie? Is it just good marketing or is there something deeper?\n\nThe centrality of marketing in the Barbie universe does not undermine the wide range of important meanings that Barbie has for her audience—both doll owners and filmgoers. Meaning is a complex negotiation between creators and the audience, and no one is better at making meaning than kids playing with toys. Whatever stories that Barbie’s inventor Ruth Handler might have had for the doll, whatever stories Mattel may have added over the years, and whatever stories that Greta Gerwig might introduce in the new film, the Barbie fans will always have the ultimate say over what Barbie means to them.\n\n–Dustin Kidd\n\nThe marketing of Barbie is fantastic. It touches on everything we teach in a marketing degree program. They’ve covered every angle. They are reaching consumers at every point in their journey: building awareness, buying the product, following up afterwards.\n\n–Sheri Lambert\n\nWhy is the Barbie movie especially well-suited for all of its brand partnerships?\n\nBecause it’s fun, and people want to be happy. Barbie and Ken are fun and happy. Pink is a fun, happy color, and brands are jumping on the bandwagon. Emotion sells—happiness sells, sadness sells, sex appeal sells.\n\n–Sheri Lambert\n\nIn the world of Barbie, jobs are reduced to outfits while consumerism is tangible. There is no shortage of dolls to purchase (various Barbies and her friends), outfits, cars, furniture, decor, etc. Barbie has always been a massive marketing machine, and the movie just takes that to another level. Barbie the doll lives inside a fantasy house and a fantasy world that Barbie owners can buy and constantly expand. Using brand tie-ins for a movie is nothing new, but no movie has ever been more primed for an onslaught of tie-ins than this one. It’s an imagination loop. The products that you buy for your Barbie doll expand her world into something that mimics the real world. The movie tie-ins expand the audience’s world to mimic the world of Barbie.\n\n–Dustin Kidd\n\nIs Barbie a feminist?\n\nWhether or not Barbie is a feminist depends a lot on the interpretation and interests of the audience members. When it comes to these issues, we put a lot of pressure on single stories, demanding that Barbie or Beyoncé or Taylor or Awkwafina be all things to all people. The best way for our entertainment industry to be more feminist is to open the door to more diverse storytellers and let them tell the stories that matter to them.\n\n–Dustin Kidd\n\nMargot Robbie plays Barbie as a fierce woman who is fearless and going out in the real world. Barbie represents how women can do anything now. For young women, it’s saying they can be anything they want to be with hard work and perseverance. The movie is a feminist masterpiece—Barbie represents female empowerment, women being fearless.\n\n–Sheri Lambert\n\nIs Barbie a good role model?\n\nSignificantly, this movie is being released in the midst of strikes by both the writers and the actors that make our entertainment industry run. If we can renegotiate how we tell stories through mass culture, we have the chance to make storytelling more equitable. In turn, those stories may help to effect change and make for a more equitable reality. If Barbie fans are inspired to build a more equitable world, then the answer is yes, but that is up to the fans.\n\n–Dustin Kidd\n\n"

        "text": "Barbie movie: How the marketing campaign has got everyone talking\n\nBy Bonnie McLaren BBC Newsbeat\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures\n\nIt feels like everyone's been living in a Barbie world thanks to the film's massive marketing campaign\n\nCome on Barbie, let's go party.\n\nAfter months of build-up on social media, the Barbie movie is finally released next week.\n\nFans are planning bottomless brunches and parties for 21 July, and over the past week Margot Robbie has been gracing global premieres in outfits inspired by real-life Barbie dolls.\n\nThe film contains some of the world's most famous actors - Ryan Gosling, Helen Mirren, Issa Rae and the new Doctor Who, Ncuti Gatwa.\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, the soundtrack has been produced by Mark Ronson and includes tracks from the likes of Dua Lipa, Tame Impala, and Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice who've combined to sample the original Barbie Girl by Aqua.\n\nBut if you feel like you've been invited along to the Barbie party, then it hasn't happened by accident.\n\nBecause it's not just the stellar cast, soundtrack or reviews that have got people talking - the film's marketing campaign has also been huge.\n\nGetty Images\n\nMargot Robbie wore a custom Vivienne Westwood outfit inspired by a 1960 Barbie at the London premiere\n\nPink billboards - which only contain the film's release date - have appeared in cities worldwide and a pink Barbie DreamHouse even appeared in Malibu, which superfans could rent on Airbnb.\n\nAnd the Barbie party also swept into London this week for the film's premiere on Wednesday.\n\nBarbican tube station was renamed Barbiecan and a pink Tardis also appeared at Tower Bridge.\n\nAnd that's not to mention the hundreds of licensing tie-ins - from shoes to clothing collections to Barbie Xbox controllers.\n\nSo if you feel like you've been seeing Barbie everywhere, you're not imagining things.\n\nAllow Twitter content?

And it's doing so well, I'm seeing it everywhere.\"\n\nAnother thing Ali thinks has helped the film are the posters, which people could edit themselves into and \"encouraged a lot of people to make their own\".\n\nHe says Barbie's marketing campaign is a stark contrast to Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, which is released on the same day.\n\nAnd while lots of people are planning to watch both on 21 July - in what's been dubbed Barbenheimer - Ali says Oppenheimer has taken a more traditional approach.\n\n\"That's a movie about the man who helped create the Manhattan Project and the atomic bomb,\" he says.\n\n\"So you can't sell toys off the back of that, you can't sell fishing rods and shirts and hats and whatever random stuff they might be selling - it's just the movie.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nPeople were even talking about the film in June 2022 when Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were snapped filming scenes\n\nMoshe Isaacian is a senior brand consultant who compiled a viral Twitter thread listing many of the Barbie marketing stunts and licensing deals.\n\nAnd if the campaign has felt like it's been going on for ages, he says the planning has been years in the works.\n\nMoshe, who's worked with Nike and Amazon, says many of the deals have been \"a year, two years in the making\" and that Mattel have been \"very good at being selective\".\n\n\"It doesn't just feel like the regular licensing deals,\" he says.\n\n\"It's more like [they're selling] Barbie's lifestyle plan now - like this is how Barbie would dress up, talk, the things she would eat, what kind of candles she would have in her house.\n\n\"These are things that mostly an older generation care about.\"\n\nAli also thinks the film has an older, and wider, appeal than the audience the dolls are marketed at - partly because it's being directed by Little Women's Greta Gerwig.\n\nIn one teaser clip, Barbie asks her fellow dolls if they ever think about dying, and Ken asks Barbie if he can stay round her house - much to Barbie's bemusement.\n\n\"It doesn't feel to me like children will be watching a children's film. In fact, and this is just a guess, I suspect young children will be bamboozled by it.\"\n\nIn contrast to the marketing side of things, there's also been a level of secrecy around the actual film itself.\n\nBBC News hasn't been able to watch it yet but the few reviews that are out there are largely positive.\n\nSo, after months of build-up - is the expensive advertising campaign going to pay off?\n\n\"I think the opening weekend for Barbie is going to be huge even if it ends up being badly reviewed, and I don't think it will be,\" Ali says.\n\n\"The excitement is at such fever pitch that it's guaranteed I think to have people in cinemas watching it, if only to see the big names.\n\n\"But also so they have their own thoughts on the thing that will be the discussion topic in pop culture for the summer.\"\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube."

        "text": "Are there more Barbie stories to be told on the big screen? Greta Gerwig sure thinks so!\n\nSpeaking with PEOPLE for the special Barbie issue (out now) alongside stars Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling and more, the director and co-writer, 39, says she hopes her film \"is the launch of a world and a bunch of different Barbie movies.\"\n\n\"There’s a tone and a humor and a joy, and obviously the world is so beautiful,\" Gerwig adds. \"I want to go back to Barbie Land.\"\n\nPraising Gerwig, Robbie, 33, tells PEOPLE, \"Greta has a very specific thing where she can be very silly and very clever at the same time, but it’s also very heartfelt.\"\n\n\"Her humor never feels cynical or cold,\" continues the actress, who plays the titular doll alongside Gosling, 42, as Ken. \"It’s always warm and loving, but also really, really silly and kind of zany and absurd. I actually think it’s a bit of a throwback in tone. To be honest, I don’t feel like I’ve seen a movie that utilizes that kind of comedy in a long, long time.\"\n\n\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human-interest stories.\n\n\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nGerwig's comments to PEOPLE about potential future Barbie film iterations come after Robbie addressed the possibility a TIME magazine cover story published last month.\n\n\"I think you fall into a bit of a trap if you try and set up a first movie whilst also planning for sequels,\" said the Oscar-nominated actress.\n\nStill, she has been part of conversations about what the future holds for Barbie in terms of a cinematic experience to follow the upcoming movie, in theaters later this month.\n\n\"It could go a million different directions from this point,\" Robbie said.\n\nFilm Name: BARBIE Copyright: Â© 2023 Warner Bros.

Meanwhile, Hari Nef, Emma Mackey, Dua Lipa, Ana Cruz Kayne, Sharon Rooney, Kate McKinnon, Nicola Coughlan, Alexandra Shipp, Ritu Arya and Issa Rae play different versions of Barbie. Emerald Fennell will appear as Midge, and Michael Cera will play Allan.\n\nAt the time of the trailer's release, character posters were also unveiled for non-Barbie characters, including America Ferrera as \"a human,\" Ariana Greenblatt as another \"human,\" Helen Mirren as \"the narrator,\" Connor Swindells as an \"intern\" and Jamie Demetriou as \"a suit,\" plus Will Ferrell.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures\n\nAsked how she began thinking about Barbie as a character, Gerwig tells PEOPLE, \"Of course, I’ve known who Barbie is for forever, and there’s some sort of collective memory that I wanted to tap into, something about: We invent things like dolls to explain to ourselves what it means to be human.\"\n\n\"Part of me wondered if there was a way that we could allow the doll to also have that humanity,\" she adds. \"Wouldn’t it be wonderful if the Queen of Plastic was given something real?\"\n\nBarbie is in theaters July 21.\n\nThe special Barbie movie issue of PEOPLE is on newsstands now."

        "text": "In case you didn't know, it's a Barbie world and we're just living in it. Not that we're complaining about the rise of Barbiecore or the endless stream of Barbie movie fashion inspiration courtesy of Margot Robbie, the film's cast, and devoted A-listers alike. There's something about Barbie — the doll, the brand, the idealogy — that's infinitely appealing and fashion girlies aren't the only ones to notice. As Barbie finally hits theaters, brands from every corner of the internet seem to have launched a Barbie collab, trademarked by Mattel and available for a limited time only.\n\nBrand collabs are nothing new, especially in fashion and beauty, but there's something about the sheer number and fervor of Barbie-branded collabs dropping this summer that feels overwhelming. Does the world need Barbie-branded sparkly platform heels? Sure, why not. How about whitening toothpaste? Well...\n\nRegardless of whether or not this summer's wild array of Barbie-branded products is necessary, they're here and we've rounded them all up — from jewelry to pool floats and ice cream flavors.\n\nBéis x Barbie™ The Movie\n\n\"The jet set life, but make it Barbie\" is the vibe behind the collab between Béis, everyone's fave chic luggage brand, and Barbie, everyone's favorite pint-size world traveler. Shoppable starting on July 19, the collection features Béis bestsellers in a colorway so vividly pink no one by Barbie herself would mistakenly grab it off the luggage carousel.\n\nPrimark's Barbie® Capsule Collection\n\nFrom the swimsuit that started it all to Barbie® Land neon separates, Primark's 73-piece Barbie® Capsule Collection quite literally has it all. We're talking womenswear, menswear, pajamas, and accessories. If you want to dive headfirst into Barbie mania without breaking the bank, we suggest you begin your descent into madness at a Primark store near you.\n\nSMASH + TESS x Barbie™\n\nWhile Basic Barbie doesn't quite have a ring to it, Barbie-themed basics are few and far between in a sea of over-the-top Mattel merch. Enter SMASH + TESS x Barbie. The infinitely wearable pieces in its Barbie collection are designed for mixing and matching. Plus, they're made in fair-wage paying factories which we think Barbie would be totally into.\n\nAlex and Ani x Barbie™\n\nSummer's bubbliest blockbuster calls for a bit of bling which is exactly what jewelry brand Alex and Ani is delivering. Made for layering, its Barbie-branded necklaces, bracelets, and earrings deliver just a dash of Barbie sparkle that won't fade once the movie leaves theaters.\n\n\n\nBarbie™ X Cotton On\n\nWe're not sure if the world needs all the Barbie collabs that have launched this summer, but we definitely want the Barbie™ X Cotton On Moto Jacket. In addition to the retro moto, the nostalgia-heavy line includes hoodies, tanks, tops, and bottoms that'll let you show off your vintage Barbie fan street cred.\n\nBurger King x Barbie\n\nY'all. Maybe it's a good thing that this Barbie-themed bacon cheeseburger with mysterious pink sauce is only available in Brazil. We're not sure we want to know what it tastes like, but we imagine it contains notes of existential crisis.\n\nBarbie™ and Joybird\n\nThe Barbie force is strong with this one. Joybird, known for its responsibly sourced furniture, has already dropped one Barbie Dreamhouse™-themed collab and has a second on the way. Arriving on July 17, the limited-edition collection featured plush velvets in grown-up but glam jewel-tone alternatives to pink.\n\nBarbie™ x Tangle Teezer\n\nFor those of us who grew up trying to unknot our Barbies' matted synthetic manes with useless doll-sized plastic combs, this collab might heal some childhood psychic wounds. Take it from this curly-haired writer: Tangle Teezer brushes are detangling machines and it totally makes sense to snag one of the line's two Totally Pink Barbie™ brushes.\n\nBarbie™ x Crocs\n\nLove them or hate them, you cannot escape Crocs, so it makes sense that this summer's most inescapable movie has teamed up with the brand for a Barbie-themed collection. The collab features Croc charms and a range of the divisive shoes in shades of Barbie pink. Even if you're morally opposed to Crocs, you have to admit the platform jelly Mega Crush Sandal is pretty cute.\n\nBarefoot Dreams x Barbie™\n\nBed Rot Barbie may not exist, but if she did, she'd stay snuggly in the Barefoot Dreams x Barbie™ Collection. It doesn't get cozier than the soft pink sweats, shorts, robes, and pullovers in this collab.\n\nBarbie™ x Boohoo\n\nOut of all the Barbie fashion collabs, Boohoo's might be the most inclusive. With Barbie-branded hoodies, tees, and comfy separates in sizes 0-24, this collection will make the hearts of logomanics sing.\n\nBarbie™ The Movie x Superga\n\nWe'll be honest, we're pretty bummed out that some of the Barbie-fied sneakers Barbie™ The Movie x Superga collection are already sold out. While you can't snag a pair of the super-stacked 2802 Barbie Rainbow Sneakers, the collection's more casual sneakers are still shoppable.\n\nPinkberry's Barbie Land Berry Pink\n\nIf you like your froyo (symbolically) Barbie-flavored, we've got great news for you. Pinkberry's Barbie Land Berry Pink flavor, a blend of strawberry and dragonfruit frozen yogurt topped with Dream Sparkles (a mix of pink, white, and silver sprinkles and edible glitter, in case you were wondering) is available now for a limited time.\n\nBarbie™ x Fossil\n\nThe best Barbie collabs let you show off your Barbie pride while also being wearable for the 364 days of the year you’re not seeing Barbie: The Movie in theaters. The Barbie™ x Fossil collection’s luxe leather goods and watches are pure Barbie magic without being obvious about it.\n\nForever 21 x Barbie™ Collection\n\nForever21's Barbie collection is one of the few collabs released this summer that contains actual Barbie dolls. Also included: fun graphic tees, terry cloth separates, and on-theme accessories.\n\nHomesick's Barbie™ Dreamhouse™ Candle\n\nLots of Barbie collabs answer questions fans may or may not have asked, including: What does Barbie's Dreamhouse smell like? If you're curious, Homesick has the answer. Its Barbie™ Dreamhouse™ Candle features base notes of sandalwood and velvet, lemon zest and pink jasmine in the middle, and top notes of sweet peony and rose bush.\n\nGap × Barbie™\n\nIt's Barbie(-trademarked) fun for the whole family! The Gap x Barbie™ Collection is actually the most well rounded collab we've seen so far featuring tees, totes, and comfy separates for kids, adults, and even pets.\n\nCanada Pooch's Barbie™ Collection\n\nIf you want more than one measly Barbie-branded dog hoodie option, Canada Pooch has you covered (No shade, Gap. We love your tote bags.) Canada Pooch's Barbie™ Collection features pet attire and toys emblazoned with the Barbie logo and signature pink prints in a range of styles and fits.\n\nBarbie™ The Movie x FUNBOY\n\nYou can now float around in it in true Malibu Barbie style thanks to FUNBOY's Barbie-branded pool float collection. This collection goes hard offering every imaginable form of Barbie transportation from yachts to surfboards, but, you know, as pool floats.\n\n\n\n\n\nBarbie™ x MeUndies\n\nEveryone's favorite comfy printed undies are now available in a retro Barbie-themed print. They're perfect for anyone who likes their underwear to feature rollerblades, disco balls, and Barbie's classic swirled \"B.\"\n\nColdstone Creamery's All That Glitters is Pink™\n\nAll That Glitters is Pink™ starts with pink cotton candy ice cream layered with graham cracker pie crust and dance party sprinkles finished with whipped topping. It's a party in a bowl.\n\nTruly x Barbie™ The Movie\n\nViral skincare brand Truly Beauty launched a Barbie-branded core collection back in May featuring Barbie-fied versions of the brand's best-loved products, like its whipped body butter and bikini serum.\n\nBarbie™ x NYX Cosmetics\n\nThe cult fave-drugstore beauty brand's nine-piece Barbie collection leans into the technicolor brightness of it all. You can shop the line's lip butters and shadow palettes separately or splurge on a vault, collector-style.\n\nBarbie™ x Kitsch\n\nAccessories brand Kitsch dropped several of its hero products, including satin pillowcases and silky scrunchies, in Barbie-bright colors and prints.\n\nBarbie™ x Ruggable Collection\n\nIf seeing Barbie: The Movie just doesn't cut it for you, you can transform your home into an IRL Barbie™ Dreamhouse™ with some Mattel-sanctioned Barbie decor. Ruggable's Barbie collection is, shockingly, not a hot pink fever dream; its washable area rugs feature a range of soft pinks and even a black and beige chevron option.\n\nBarbie™ The Movie x Impala Skate\n\nRiding high on the viral sensation caused by last summer's Barbie set stills, Impala has launched technicolor retro rollerblades, protective knee, elbow, and wrist guards, and, of course, Barbie-branded athletic crew socks.\n\nCHI x Barbie™ Totally Hair Collection\n\nThis Ulta Beauty exclusive collection, featuring two hot tools and a travel case, have some notable Barbie hair-itage. All three products in the collection feature the trippy, colorful print worn by the bestselling \"Totally Hair\" Barbie released in 1992 (which Margot Robbie recently channeled).\n\nBarbie™ x ALDO\n\nWe already told y'all. The collection of accessories, heels, and sneakers(!!!) is cute, affordable, and very, very pink.\n\nBarbie™ x MOON Oral Care\n\nDid you know Barbie™ the Movie has an exclusive oral beauty brand? It's MOON, and it features a two-piece set containing an electric toothbrush and whitening toothpaste. Yes, both are very pink.\n\nBarbie® x Hot Wheels® x rue21\n\nThis three-way collab has a whooping 29 pieces, all with a bit of a throwback vibe. It's available online and in-store.\n\nBarbie™ x Swoon\n\nWhat is it? Pink lemonade with zero sugar. Why is it? The brand's founder is a Type 1 diabetic, and 10% of the collab's net sales support the Dream Gap Project. How much does it cost? Merch and case combos start at $30, but you can also buy a \"summer stock\" of Barbie™ x Swoon Pink Lemonade for $5,500.\n\nBarbie™ By PacSun\n\nBarbie™ By PacSun leaned hard into the Malibu Barbie of it all with its ‘90s-inspired collection of tees, swimwear, and denim separates.\n\nBarbie™ x Hally Shade Stix\n\nThe Barbie™ x Hally Shade Stix from Hally Hair do what you'd expect: They temporarily deposit three Barbie-approved colors — Signature Pink, Malibu Blue, and Pump Up Purple — into your hair. According to the brand, the colors rinse out with a single wash. Also according to the brand, Barbie dolls are not included with purchase.\n\nShow Me Your Mumu x Barbie™\n\nOkay, y'all. No cap, the Barbie™ Babe One Piece from the Show Me Your Mumu x Barbie™ Collection is legitimately adorable. The rest of the collection's swimwear, activewear, dresses, and separates is also pretty stinkin' cute.\n\nBarbie™ x Posh Peanut\n\nEven (maybe especially?) toddlers and kids deserve the chance to flaunt their Barbie pride. Posh Peanut's Barbie collection delivers primarily pint-sized onesies, separates, and accessories for tiny Barbie fans along with pajamas for equally enthused parents.\n\n"

        "text": "The Barbie film has an iconic cast, through and through.\n\nBut while everyone's familiar with the big names of the cast, there's one name that some moviegoers might not have been familiar with — and they may not even be familiar with her face. They'll definitely know her work though.\n\nThat person is Oscar-winning costume designer Ann Roth.\n\nRoth is featured in the first trailer for Barbie and shares the cutest (and also funniest) scene with star Margot Robbie. While Robbie is having a bit of a tough moment, she encounters Roth on a bench, looks at her and tells her she's beautiful. Without batting an eye, Roth tells her that she knows, and the two of them laugh.\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone earlier this month, director and co-writer Greta Gerwig discussed Roth's cameo in her film.\n\n\"I love that scene so much,” said Gerwig, adding that Roth is a “legend.”\n\nFurther breaking down the scene, Gerwig continued: “It’s a cul-de-sac of a moment, in a way — it doesn’t lead anywhere. And in early cuts, looking at the movie, it was suggested, ‘Well, you could cut it. And actually, the story would move on just the same.’ And I said, ‘If I cut the scene, I don’t know what this movie is about.’\"\n\nThe tug-at-your-heart-strings bit, to Gerwig, is “the heart of the movie. The way Margot plays that moment is so gentle and so unforced.”\n\nRoth, 91, has more than 100 credits to her name and has been nominated for five academy awards for her costume work. She's won two — for The English Patient and Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.\n\nShe's also notably worked with Gerwig's partner, Noah Baumbach, on three projects: Margot at the Wedding, While We're Young and White Noise. She's worked across movies, TV and theater and also took home a Tony Award in 2013 for The Nance.\n\nHan Myung-Gu/WireImage\n\nIn an exclusive interview with PEOPLE for the special Barbie issue (out now) alongside Robbie, Ryan Gosling and more, Gerwig couldn't help but be nostalgic about being in Barbie world.\n\n\"There’s a tone and a humor and a joy, and obviously the world is so beautiful,\" Gerwig said. \"I want to go back to Barbie Land.\"\n\nShe may or may not have to wait for long for her return. Gerwig added that she hopes the movie, in theaters Friday July 21, \"is the launch of a world and a bunch of different Barbie movies.\"\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up to date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nJon Kopaloff/Getty I\n\nWhat’s already proved to be worth the hype surrounding the film is the pink fashions, which were glimpsed at the height of the Barbie press tour.\n\nRobbie, 33, and her stylist Andrew Mukamal were extremely committed to paying tribute to the Barbie-verse with detailed looks inspired by dolls throughout the decades.\n\nAxelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic\n\nWhether she was quite literally stealing the carpet dressed up as the ‘60s Solo in the Spotlight figurine or channeling the 1992 Totally Hair Barbie in disco glam, the actress was all for bringing the Mattel icon to life even further.\n\n“We're finding Barbie references from decades past and just doing it really for the big Barbie fans out there, people who are actually collecting those Barbies. We're hoping to get them excited,” Robbie told PEOPLE exclusively at the Barbie world premiere."

And I thought, 'Oh god, no! That's terrifying! That's a nightmare.'\"\n\n\"Also,\" she added, \"Margot has the nicest feet. She has these beautiful dancer feet. I was like, 'She should just hang onto that bar and do it just like this.'\"\n\nRobbie, also a producer on the movie, previously confirmed that the shot Gerwig referred to featured her real feet, explaining that she did hold onto a bar to achieve the scene. \"I really don't like it when someone else does my hands or feet in an insert shot,\" she said in a recent Time cover story.\n\nGerwig added on The Project that the scene \"felt like a Bat Signal,\" as did the typography of the giant B on the Barbie Land sign, to mark the introduction of the iconic doll. \"Globally it's known, but also we kind of share this collective of what Barbie means,\" she said. \"Even though it's this huge movie, it feels very personal to me.

        "text": "While this summer’s hotly-anticipated “Barbie” movie has only dropped the vaguest hints about what fans can except, the British Board of Film Classification has offered some more clues after awarding the film a 12A rating on Monday.\n\nThe org, which is responsible for age rating films in the U.K., cited “bleeped strong language,” “moderate innuendo” and “dangerous behavior,” referring to a scene in which “a child melts a doll’s hair using a lighter” to explain the 12A classification.\n\nAmong the details that made the BBFC decide the film’s younger audiences would require adult supervision are “comic fight scenes” including “punches, kicks, headbutts and use of improvised weapons” and “occasional verbal references to death and mental health.” According to the organization, fans can also expect to see a car chase.\n\nA scene that is briefly shown in the trailer – where Barbie punches a man after he slaps her butt – is also highlighted under “sexual violence and sexual threat.” “There is a scene of sexual harassment in which men catcall a woman and make inappropriate comments about her appearance,” says the BBFC report card. “A man slaps a woman’s bottom, however, his behaviour is immediately challenged and results in negative consequences.”\n\nWhile most of the film’s language is pretty tame, the BBFC warns it does includes “bleeped strong language” and “moderate bad language” — citing the words “motherfucker” and “bitch” — as well as terms including “crap,” “hell” and “damn.”\n\nThe BBFC’s classification adds there are also “gags about ‘beaching off’ and ‘sugar daddies.'”\n\nThe U.K.’s 12A rating means children under the age of 12 can still see the movie if they are accompanied by an adult.\n\nOn the same day the BBFC awarded “Barbie” its 12A rating, on the other side of the globe Vietnam’s ministry of culture banned the film entirely after ruling the film violates the country’s “sovereignty.” The offending scene reportedly features a map with the “nine dash line,” representing China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea."

        "text": "The multiplex is about to get Barbiefied, but the soon-to-be hit isn’t the first film to feature Mattel’s favorite plaything. A previous Barbie movie was made in 1987, an experimental musical biopic that barely saw the light of day. The dolls sing, and they argue, and the most famous one dies. Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story was an art school project by a mischievous but deadly earnest Bard College MFA student named Todd Haynes. Yes, before he went on to make major, Oscar-nominated films like Far From Heaven and Carol, Haynes was playing with dolls.\n\nSuperstar didn’t circulate for long; Karen Carpenter’s brother and bandmate, Richard, successfully sued for copyright infringement – the film features uncleared Carpenters music throughout, and he was also enraged by his portrayal in the film, since Haynes insinuates that Richard, who was married to his first cousin at the time, is gay – consigning the 43-minute creative burst to cult-curio status. But it has thrived there, with bootlegs becoming an avant-garde badge of honor. Entertainment Weekly named it one of the top 50 cult movies ever made. Today you can see blurry versions on YouTube.\n\nIt is well worth your time. Superstar remains haunting and quite moving in exploring Karen’s struggle with disordered eating, and her death from heart failure at the age of 32. Haynes makes frequent use of onscreen text: “We will see how Karen’s visibility as a popular singer only intensified certain difficulties many women experience in relation to their bodies.” And, of course, there are the Barbies, made up and dressed for realism, serving as the perfect vessels for Haynes’ vision.\n\nBart Weiss is among the film’s legions of fans. The founder of Dallas VideoFest, a longtime showcase for the avant-garde and out of the ordinary, he was never able to show Superstar due to legal restrictions. But he has one of those VHS bootlegs, as well as a DVD anthology of illegal works, released by the now-defunct Stay Free! magazine, that includes the film. He believes Superstar remains worthy of study. Editor’s picks\n\n“The first time you hear about it, you think, ‘Oh, it’s just going to be a spoof of Karen Carpenter,’” Weiss says. “But it’s actually a very serious film, and the idea of using these dolls is really about the sense of perfection, which is what was really driving Karen Carpenter crazy. After about 10 minutes the novelty just sort of recedes into the background, and the foreground is incredibly powerful.”\n\nDirector Todd Haynes poses with his hands folded under his chin, New York, New York, November 5, 1987. Michel Delsol/Getty Images\n\nBarbie has long been castigated for perpetuating impossible standards of physical appearance, from the pert facial features to the ridiculously slender physique (although recent iterations have brought more diversity in this regard and others). Greta Gerwig’s new Barbie movie, starring Margot Robbie as the eponymous human doll, plays with this idea, casting the heroine into the real world, where all manner of imperfection lurks. But Haynes was way ahead of the curve. We see his Karen/Barbie push away food and leave boxes of laxatives laying around her room. She collapses onstage from exhaustion. Her family berates her. The filmmaker mixes in live-action footage of the Vietnam War, and talking-head commentary from fake experts, including an opinionated DJ played by Haynes himself. Trending Texas Threatens Doctors After Judge Says Woman Can Get Emergency Abortion Taylor Swift's 'Time' Cover Is Breaking Far-Right Brains Multiple Women Accuse Popular Van Life Influencer of Unwanted Sexual Behavior Nicki Minaj Reveals 'Pink Friday 2' Track List Ahead of Release\n\nHaynes was an avid student of semiotics, the systematic study of sign processes and meaning-making often used in analyzing film and literature. The Superstar Barbies are the ultimate signifiers, suggesting the artificial realm to which the film’s heroine aspires. The film is also a dryly caustic send-up of the music industry, with an A&M executive, voiced by the actor Rob LaBelle (who also plays Karen and Richard’s father), exclaiming his plans for The Carpenters with a coldness that only an inanimate object could conjure.\n\nIn other words, Superstar is not a comedy at all, but a sneakily subversive tragedy and an inspired wedding of form and content. The fact that you’re not supposed to be able to see it only adds to the thrill. It’s hard to blame anyone in Carpenter’s family for wanting to suppress it, especially given the music clearance issues. But it’s impossible to deny the film’s resonance and its palpable sympathy for Karen Carpenter’s plight. As one Barbie movie makes a box office fortune in the coming weeks, carve out a little time for its forbidden predecessor."

        "text": "Why \"Barbie\" is in hot water over the nine-dash-line\n\nDonald Rothwell is a professor of international law at Australian National University.\n\nThe new \"Barbie\" film starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is set for imminent release. But according to Vietnam's state-run Tuoi Tre newspaper, the film's release has been barred. The head of the Department of Cinema, a government body in charge of licensing and censoring foreign films, said:\n\nWe do not grant license for the American movie 'Barbie' to release in Vietnam because it contains the offending image of the nine-dash line\n\nVietnam's response to the \"Barbie\" movie's depiction of the South China Sea shows how sensitive these matters are in South East Asia, and especially in Vietnam.\n\nWhat is the nine-dash line?\n\nThe South China Sea has a long history of being contested.\n\nChina and Vietnam engaged in military clashes over the Paracel and Spratly Islands in the South China Sea in 1974 and 1988.\n\nThose disputes were over land, but more recently the focus has turned to claims over the continental shelf (the area of seabed that extends beyond the coast to at least 200 nautical miles) and the economic zones (the area at least 200 nautical miles from the coast).\n\nSince the late 1940s, China has promoted the so-called nine-dash line in the South China Sea. The line, also known as the \"U-shaped line\" or \"cow's tongue\" comprises nine dashes.\n\nAs depicted in various official and unofficial Chinese maps, the line extends off the coast of China's Hainan Island, and runs close to the coast of Vietnam, deep into the South China Sea, enclosing the Spratly Islands.\n\nNorth of Borneo, near the coasts of Malaysia and Brunei, the line turns and runs to the west of the Philippines and ends just to the south of Taiwan.\n\nThe line has long been the subject of speculation as to what exactly it purports to encompass. Is it a Chinese territorial claim? Is it a Chinese claim to a maritime space? Does it extend to sovereignty over the whole area or just to resources?\n\nChina has never been very explicit as to precisely what the claim includes but it has been persistent in seeking to advance the claim.\n\nThis has especially been the case since Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam have begun to advance their own claims to parts of the South China Sea, which overlap the nine-dash line.\n\nChina’s “nine-dash line” demarcation gives it control of most of the South China Sea. https://t.co/7N0S4IJnGW pic.twitter.com/iPNJuaxuLC — Geopolitical Intelligence Services (@GIS_Reports) August 24, 2016\n\nWho disputes the line?\n\nA 2009 joint Malaysia/Vietnam submission to the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf highlighted competing claims over the continental shelf in the South China Sea, which is what sparked the current controversy.\n\nChina made a formal diplomatic response to the UN claiming:\n\nChina has indisputable sovereignty over the islands in the South China Sea and the adjacent waters, and enjoys indisputable sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the relevant waters as well as the seabed and subsoil thereof (see attached map).\n\nChina attached a copy of the nine-dash line map to its formal diplomatic protest to the Malaysia/Vietnam submission and added:\n\nThe above position is consistently held by the Chinese Government, and is widely known by the international community.\n\nIt turned out, however, that this was not a widely known or shared view by the international community. Since then the commission has become something of a de facto legal battleground for various views regarding the status of the nine-dash line.\n\nIn addition to China continuously advancing its position regarding the legitimacy of the nine-dash line, countries including Australia, France, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, United Kingdom and Vietnam have rebutted China's assertions.\n\nBut the commission is not a court and is comprised of scientists who assess continental shelf claims.\n\nIt was up to the Philippines, as the other nation with possible claims on the region, to separately challenge the legality of China's nine-dash line claim under the law of the sea. In 2016, a United Nations Law of the Sea Convention Tribunal ruled unanimously that China's claim had no basis in international law.\n\nThat ruling was clear-cut and conclusive, and immediately rejected by China. While the Philippines conclusively won the legal argument that the nine-dash line had no basis in modern international law or the law of the sea, China refused to respect the outcome of that case and continues to assert its South China Sea entitlements.\n\nChina does this in multiple ways. It has built artificial islands in the South China Sea, harassed foreign naval and military aircraft passing through the region, intimidated Vietnamese and other foreign fishermen, asserted rights to explore and exploit maritime oil and gas reserves, and continued to publish maps depicting the nine-dash line claim.\n\nThis is why any legitimacy given to the nine-dash line, even in Hollywood movies, is so sensitive.\n\nI spent part of the morning reply guying policy peoples questions about Vietnam banning the Barbie movie with the nine dash line map with this image of the map pic.twitter.com/oqJ91HJVUh — Lmao gan ma (@rzhongnotes) July 3, 2023\n\nWhy are maps so controversial?\n\nMaps are reflective of a critical national attribute: territory.\n\nThey define the outer limits of territorial claims. Children are familiarised with their home country by maps. Maps have historically been depicted on postage stamps, buildings and more recently, government websites.\n\nMaps now depict a country digitally and this has become contested, as highlighted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nUniversity students challenge their professors when maps are shown that depict disputed lands.\n\nMaps have meaning and touch national sensitivities.\n\nVietnam's response to Hollywood's depiction of China's nine-dash line is understandable. It demonstrates a fierce resistance to any legitimacy that China's ongoing South China Sea nine-dash line claims may generate, even in Barbie's fictional world.\n\nA spokesperson for the Warner Bros. Film Group told CBS News, \"The map in Barbie Land is a child-like crayon drawing. The doodles depict Barbie's make-believe journey from Barbie Land to the 'real world.' It was not intended to make any type of statement.\"\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license."

        "text": "Barbie is a movie that benefits from multiple screenings. On every viewing, you’ll catch something different, whether it’s a big idea or a tiny detail. When it hits theaters on July 21, every person who has ever dressed a Barbie up is bound to recognize some outfit or prop from their childhood, whether they played with the doll in the 1960s or 1990s. And even the Barbie agnostic will find something to pick up, whether it’s references to the technicolor musicals of Old Hollywood or a famous scene from The Matrix.\n\nFilmed primarily at a studio in London, the story of Barbie begins in a pink wonderland called Barbie Land where there’s an all-female Supreme Court, and, as Helen Mirren’s narrator tells the audience, “all problems of feminism and equal rights have been solved.” The Barbies celebrate their good fortune with nightly slumber parties. It’s a lived-in fantasy world that relies primarily on physical sets rather than CGI. To build out Barbie Land, writer-director Greta Gerwig decided to create a coherent set of rules that would govern how it looked and functioned. In order to do that, she dove into the history of Barbie, the history of movies, and the history of fashion. For a cover story on the new film, Gerwig, producer and star Margot Robbie, and creatives at Mattel spoke to TIME about how they dreamt up all the details in the film.\n\nThe Barbie team attended a Barbie bootcamp\n\nOver the course of 2018 and 2019, Gerwig, Robbie, and folks from Robbie’s production company LuckyChap went through an immersion course designed by Mattel. The unofficial Barbie bootcamp began with the doll’s origin story—Barbie was created by Ruth Handler—and took a tour through some of Barbie’s best outfits over the years.\n\nMore from TIME\n\nRead More: How Barbie Came to Life\n\nThis research served as inspiration for the story. Handler’s relationship with her daughter Barbara (after whom Barbie is named) manifested as a plot point involving a mother and daughter in the film. “A Barbie movie is only ever going to be a mother-daughter movie on so many levels because it was Ruth Handler and Barbara—that was the relationship,” says Gerwig.\n\nGerwig and filmmaker Noah Baumbach, her co-writer and partner, also had to build a world from scratch. They came up with rules for Barbie Land to keep everything coherent. “You see a seamless universe that all makes sense, and that’s because there were these very specific boundaries about what could and couldn’t happen,” says Kate McKinnon, who plays one of the Barbies. One such rule? Barbie Land is a utopia, so nothing can be cluttered. There is no trash. “Nothing is dirty in the world, even when it gets its most chaotic,” says McKinnon. “I was struck by that.”\n\nBarbie’s 1950s origins inspired the Dream House aesthetic\n\nGiven that Barbie first came to market in 1959, Gerwig and Oscar-nominated production designer Sarah Greenwood decided to run with a midcentury modern aesthetic for Barbie’s Dream House and many of her fashions. Barbie lives on the sort of suburban cul de sac idealized in that era.\n\nThe Dream Houses were built without walls so the actors had to be attached to wires to make sure they didn’t topple off the top floors of their homes when they got out of bed. But the cast says everything else in their Dream Houses was surprisingly functional: They would sit on the retro chairs and hang out talking between takes. “We all just wanted to kick it in each other’s living rooms because they were so fabulous,” says Alexandra Shipp, who plays an author Barbie.\n\nRead More: Why It Took 64 Years to Make a Barbie Movie\n\nSkipper’s house is the only one on the block that’s purple instead of pink. Leaves are growing out of the roof, and a swing is tied to a protruding branch. Technically it is the Chelsea Tree House—nearly an exact replica, scaled up to fit human actors.\n\nIn fact, everything in Barbie Land is built to a specific scale to look “toyetic.” “The scale is not life-like,” says Lisa McKnight, the executive vice president at Mattel whose job is specifically to oversee the marketing of Barbie and dolls. For instance, Barbie the character’s Corvette is just a little too small for Robbie, just as Barbie the doll’s convertible is a little too small for her: The windshield only comes up to her chest.\n\nGerwig was influenced by Old Hollywood\n\nGerwig’s team didn’t just study midcentury furniture trends. The filmmaker also revisited the films of Old Hollywood to capture the look of those stories. Rather than using a green screen to ensure that there were only bright blue skies in idyllic Barbie Land, Gerwig’s team hand-painted the backdrops to look like old soundstage musicals. In an early scene, Ken tries to interact with a set backdrop with disastrous results.\n\nRead More: Barbie’s Got a New Body\n\nMany of the props on set were also painted by hand, from the trees to the pool that sits outside of Barbie’s Dream House and contains no water. “I remember even the bark of the palm trees had different shades of brown, green, and even pink,” says McKnight.\n\nBarbie is filled with dance numbers that are heavily influenced by 1940s and 50s Technicolor musicals like Singin’ in the Rain. During filming, Robbie’s production company LuckyChap hosted a film festival of sorts playing movies that influenced Barbie.\n\nBut Gerwig didn’t limit herself to one era. The movie is stuffed with references to all sorts of films ranging from Rocky to 2001: A Space Odyssey to Clueless.\n\nThe devil in the tiny, pink details\n\nBarbie Land comes to life in the details. Gerwig obsessed over it all, and the props that populate the fantastical space imbue it with a surprisingly lived-in quality, like a Barbie version of the book Moby Dick on a side table. All the letters in Barbie’s mailbox have been scribbled upon in a nonsense language, like a child might write.\n\nBarbie devotees know that Pantone 219 is Barbie’s very specific shade of pink. A giant Pantone 219 chip sits outside the Barbie conference room at Mattel. But the set used so much pink paint—in that specific color as well as secondary and tertiary shades—that it precipitated a worldwide shortage. The sheer number of pinks in every shot presented their own challenge. “I don’t think we have seen or will ever see a film with more pink in it,” says producer David Heyman, who helped build another famous fantasy world with the Harry Potter film series. “And then how to handle that photographically—thank goodness we had Rodrigo Prieto, who was able to balance all that and create a beautiful and rich palette.”\n\nOut now: TIME’s new special edition about Barbie is available at newsstands and here online\n\nThe soundtrack is filled with today’s top artists, but even the singers were chosen with intention. Issa Rae, who plays President Barbie, points out that Barbie’s image among adults has been buoyed in recent years by Nicki Minaj, who has adopted the name “Barbie” as one of her personas. Minaj, along with Ice Spice, are the ones remixing Aqua’s old “Barbie Girl” song in a wink to Barbie’s influence on music throughout the years. “My Barbie association is Nicki Minaj,” says Rae. “So it’s dope that she is a part of this movie in some way.”\n\nBarbie’s fashion is (almost) always on point\n\nBeyond the Barbie immersion course, Gerwig and Baumbach did their own deep dive to dig up even more details about particularly strange or controversial outfits or dolls Mattel produced over the years. Robbie’s Barbie and Ryan Gosling’s Ken donned collector’s items that we won’t spoil for superfans. And, yes, some of the stranger toys show up in the movie too. The marketing rollout has already revealed that the pregnant Midge doll who quite literally popped a baby out makes an appearance in the film. (Emerald Fennell has the honor of portraying the unusual toy.)\n\nRead More: What to Know About Midge and Allan, the Deepest Cuts From the Barbie Movie\n\nOscar-winning costume designer Jacqueline Durran was charged with replicating some of Barbie’s most iconic looks. She had a direct line to Kim Culmone, the head of design for fashion dolls at Mattel, who in turn would dive deep into the archives to provide the filmmaking team with references. Every bathing suit and camp shirt was handmade and silk screened and completely custom. “Whether it’s 1950s ladylike attire or a Western Barbie and Ken look or the rollerblades, those looks stick out to me as really toyetic,” says Culmone. “And that was important because even though we were putting Barbie in the real world, there was always a commitment to serve the fans of Barbie with these toyetic references.”\n\nBut the specific touches are what truly made the set a work of art. At one point during the movie, Ken walks around in a pair of boxing shoes that are made specifically for smooth surfaces, which is fine because there’s no real grass, gravel, or dirt in Barbie Land.\n\nPhotograph by Carlota Guerrero for TIME\n\nWrite to Eliana Dockterman at eliana.dockterman@time.com."

And while her salary has not been made public, the movie has a budget of $145 million, according to Variety. Gerwig's leading actors, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, are each making $12.5 million for the film, Variety also reported.\n\nDespite Gerwig's Hollywood success and directing accolades, though, she hasn't always been comfortable in salary negotiations, she told CNBC Make It in 2020.\n\nEven with her agent acting as an intermediary, \"I always have this sense of, 'Don't negotiate, just take whatever they'll give us,' because I'm just so scared that I won't be able to make a movie,\" she said. \"I don't want to ask for too much.\"\n\nFor that reason, she's glad to have a middleman pushing for more than she might herself.\n\nWithin the movie industry, Gerwig believes there is a need for more women directors. More movies should be made about women as well, she told Make It in 2020.\n\nOutside of Hollywood, there is also room to grow when it comes to women's salary lobbying power. Only 26% of female jobseekers negotiated their salaries, compared with 35% of male jobseekers, a 2018 survey from Jobvite found.\n\nAnd Gerwig isn't alone in her fear of asking for too much. Even when women ask for raises as much as men do, they're only successful 15% of the time, compared with men's 20%, researchers from the Harvard Business Review reported in 2018.\n\nFor many women, a major factor for a successful negotiation is knowing what you're worth and asking to be paid a fair market value. Go into the discussion with hard facts about what your peers are earning and prove why you're an asset to the company.\n\nBut for Gerwig, directing movies comes with a much different pay structure than other professions. \"Figuring out how you should be reimbursed for something and what you are worth is complicated,\" she says. How do you evaluate your value before you've even started the project?\n\nPart of the problem is a lack of transparency around pay, an issue that isn't unique to Hollywood, but certainly affects it. \"On the one hand, everything is so public — you know how much a movie is grossing and you know roughly what the cost of making it was — but everything else is so hidden, like how much people are making or what their deals are,\" Gerwig says.\n\nEventually, she sees herself working toward a compensation structure that reflects how well her movies perform, she says, like the many established directors who choose to own part of their film in place of taking a salary upfront.\n\nAs Gerwig puts it, it's \"a way to bet on yourself.\"\n\nThis is an updated version of an article originally published in February 2020.\n\nDON'T MISS: Want to be smarter and more successful with your money, work & life?

        "text": "The much-hyped release of the Barbie movie this summer has captured the attention of pop culture enthusiasts and toy lovers around the world, with the “Barbiecore” trend of hot-pink–infused retro style infiltrating everything from fashion to gaming consoles to even Airbnb rentals. But behind this cinematic extravaganza lies a tale of reinvention and strategic prowess by Mattel, the renowned toy company.\n\nRichard Dickson, president and chief operating officer of Mattel, shed light on the struggles, triumphs, and future of the iconic Barbie brand in a conversation with Fortune at Cannes Lions—the creative industry’s equivalent of the Oscars.\n\nA challenging road\n\nWhile Mattel’s legacy spans nearly eight decades, it hasn’t all been smooth sailing for Barbie.\n\nDickson acknowledged the brand’s past struggles, admitting: “Consumers didn’t think that she was relevant. She didn’t reflect the world that kids live in.”\n\nThis sentiment was reinforced by internal market research in 2014 that revealed Barbie’s diminishing appeal and her inability to inspire and represent diversity. Dickson said the brand hit its lowest point in over 14 years, marking a pivotal and arduous time for Mattel.\n\n“Moms were choosing other brands besides Barbie; the business itself was reflecting that,” he said.\n\nReinventing Barbie\n\nTo reverse the decline, Mattel embarked on a comprehensive rebranding strategy, using a playbook which proved a springboard to many of the brand’s smash-hits.\n\nDickson outlined its four key components, the first being a reevaluation of the brand’s purpose. “Why do we even exist? What made us great to begin with?” he said.\n\nFor Barbie, it meant reigniting her original essence of “inspiring the limitless potential of girls,” a vision Ruth Handler, Barbie’s founder, embraced when she created the 11-and-a-half-inch doll.\n\nThe second component focuses on design-led innovation, ensuring inclusivity and representation through doll development. Mattel aimed to create dolls that mirrored the diverse world around us, including the release of its first-ever doll with Down syndrome.\n\nRemaining culturally relevant is the third pillar of the playbook, enabling Mattel to tap into the pulse of society and connect with its target audience.\n\nFinally, executing with excellence was paramount, ensuring that brilliant ideas seamlessly transition into tangible market offerings.\n\n“Great ideas are great, but if you can’t bring them to market, they’re nothing but great ideas,” Dickson said.\n\nA glimpse into the future\n\nToday, Mattel stands on the precipice of a monumental theatrical event—the release of the Barbie movie starring Hollywood A-listers Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, which proved such an enormous production effort that it sparked a global shortage of hot-pink paint.\n\nBut that turnaround has only been made possible owing to the efficacy of the playbook in practice, and Dickson proudly announced: “We hit our highest level of business ever in 2021.”\n\nMattel’s journey of reinvention, however, does not end here.\n\nLooking to the future, Dickson mapped out Mattel’s strategic vision—unlocking the value of their intellectual property, or IP.\n\nWhile Barbie takes the lead with her foray into the theatrical realm, Mattel has a lineup of 13 other brands in various stages of film development, ranging from theatrical releases to television shows, live experiences, and digital gaming.\n\nThe objective is clear: to present Mattel’s cherished IP through captivating storytelling formats, thereby boosting toy sales, consumer product relevance, and impact across diverse categories.\n\nWith the Barbie movie as catalyst, it paves the way for an era of creativity and content creation at Mattel.\n\nThe company’s commitment to unlocking the potential of its IP ensures that audiences can anticipate more captivating movies and experiences to come."

        "text": "It is almost impossible to escape the bright pink posters signalling the imminent release of Greta Gerwig’s Barbie movie. The film represents the Mattel doll’s first live-action film appearance and has successfully captured the cultural zeitgeist as millennials flock to post their best Barbie-inspired outfits on TikTok (videos featuring the Barbiecore hashtag have more than 570 million views).\n\nThe buzz that the film has generated is no coincidence – Mattel’s Barbie division has spent $100m on marketing this year, according to Media Radar. It also marks the first major step in the company’s business transformation from toy maker to an intellectual property-driven outfit.\n\nThis new vision for the business was set out by Ynon Kreiz, who became Mattel’s CEO in 2018. The year prior, the company had made an operating loss of more than $339m and the bankruptcy of Toys ‘R’ Us was cited in Mattel’s financial results as having had a “significant impact” on its revenue. In response, Kreiz’s long-term strategy shifted away from retail and towards capturing the “full value of Mattel’s IP through franchise management”.\n\nIn essence, Mattel set out to breathe new life into its popular roster of brands, which alongside Barbie includes Hot Wheels, Thomas & Friends and Uno. And it wants to do this by translating them to the big screen and in the process capturing a new audience.\n\nThis Barbie is a marketing machine\n\nThe idea is not revolutionary, as Sharon Price John, the current CEO of Build-A-Bear Workshop and director of Mattel’s Barbie division from 1994 to 1999, notes: “The intersection of entertainment and the toy industry has been happening for years.” However, a cursory glance down the list of upcoming box-office releases suggests this strategy is undergoing a resurgence.\n\nMattel alone has 45 films based on its IP in development. These include a horror-themed Magic 8 Ball movie, a “surrealistic” project based on the purple dinosaur Barney, a heist flick based on the game Uno and a JJ Abrams-produced Hot Wheels film. Lego is working on a third Lego movie and, following the box office success of Dungeons and Dragons, Hasbro has films based on its GI Joe, Beyblade, Monopoly, Action Man, Furby and Cluedo brands in development.\n\nBrands are realising that if they can get people to spend 90 minutes with their IP while watching a movie, it could have a really positive effect on sales\n\n“The intertwining of storytelling and toys is pretty fundamental,” says John, who also worked at Hasbro in the 2000s when the business first went through a similar pivot with the release of the robot-battling blockbuster Transformers. “But one of the things that has created this recent resurgence is the decline of traditional advertising methods for toys.”\n\nWhere once toy companies could reach a guaranteed audience through TV adverts during Saturday morning cartoons, younger audiences’ attention is now split between video games, social media, YouTube and other video-on-demand services. “The industry seeks to create that one-to-one relationship with children and one of the few ways to continue to do that is through the creation of its own content,” she adds.\n\nAnother factor influencing this trend is the growing adult market for toys. “By opening up its IP to Hollywood, Mattel is playing heavily into the strength of nostalgia among a generation of adults that used to buy its products,” says Zoe Scaman, founder of brand strategy studio Bodacious, which works with businesses to open up their IP to new audiences and revenue opportunities.\n\n“These brands are realising that if they can get people to spend 90 minutes with their IP while watching a movie, it could have a really positive effect on sales.”\n\nFunding a shift to films\n\nThat is not to say the shift is easy. The cost of producing a feature film with a full line-up of Hollywood A-listers, akin to Barbie, is prohibitively expensive for most companies. But there are ways to structure deals or arrange payments that can help mitigate this.\n\nMattel has launched a number of new products to coincide with the release of Barbie “The approach that different companies may take is determinant of its success as an ad tool to drive sales,” John adds. “This can allow you to recoup the upfront cost on the increased margin of product sales you make as a result.” Build-A-Bear Workshop released Honey Girls, a film based on its popular range of girl band-themed stuffed animals, alongside Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions in 2021. And the positive impact it’s had at the checkout has been noticeable. The average transaction value at one of its retail stores is around $50, whereas for purchases that include a Honey Girls-themed product, this can rise to $100, John claims. “I can only say it’s a high correlation, but it would be odd if the movie release hadn’t had anything to do with the fact that our dollar-per-transaction nearly doubled,” she says. Nintendo has also noticed an uptick in interest in its products following the release of the The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which released in April this year. Answering questions at a recent investor call, its president Shuntaro Furukawa said: “the movie inspires interest in Mario games and has a positive effect on sales of Nintendo Switch hardware and software over the medium-to long-term.”\n\nEntertainment as a marketing opportunity\n\nIt’s not just toy companies that are looking to capitalise on the benefits of movie tie-ins. Earlier this year, people flocked to watch Air, which charted the rise of Nike’s Air Jordan brand, and before 2023 is over, cinemagoers will be able to watch the story behind the development of Kellogg’s best-selling breakfast pastry in Unfrosted: The Pop-Tart Story, as well as Eva Longoria’s retelling of the creation of the ‘Flamin’ Hot’ Cheetos flavour.\n\n“It’s a proven model but it’s still evolving. People are now seeing entertainment as a marketing opportunity, rather than just another path to revenue,” John says. “This means we’re going to see more brands use this strategy to bring their characters and stories to life.”\n\nThe push for more brand-based movies is also coming from Hollywood studios. Although interesting corporate stories have been given the big-screen treatment before, from The Founder to Steve Jobs and The Social Network, there has been a glut of them this year, with Tetris, BlackBerry and Flamin’ Hot all released in 2023.\n\nShawn Robbins, chief analyst at Boxoffice Pro, comments: “Nostalgia and brand familiarity have been major selling points throughout media and entertainment for some time. That represents a perfect crossroad when it comes to the business of Hollywood, where studios are typically risk averse. Any property with built-in awareness will be of automatic interest to them.”\n\nFilms based on existing IP carry another perk for Hollywood studios, which are increasingly having to work on tight budgets. “The brands are often willing to push the film and market the shit out of it, as we’ve seen with Barbie and Mattel,” Scaman says. “This makes it a lower risk option with a potentially much higher reward.”\n\nCan any IP be turned into a film?\n\nWith a projected $110m US opening, it’s likely that many brands will be looking to dust off their dormant IP in the hope of replicating the success of Barbie. But this does not make it a suitable marketing opportunity for every business. “Any IP can be turned into a film, but not any IP can be turned into a good film,” John notes.\n\nSo, what should companies consider in order to make the strategy a success. John advises business leaders to ask whether their brand is truly beloved, whether it has a following and whether there is a pre-existing story arch. “That doesn’t mean you can’t weave a story around a product that’s beloved,” she adds. “I think Lego did a great job of that.”\n\nAny IP can be turned into a film, but not any IP can be turned into a good film\n\nShe also advises companies to keep in mind their intentions: does creating a critically acclaimed film actually matter or is it more important to improve awareness and unit sales of any associated products? “I believe in it as a strategy because storytelling and intellectual property have tremendous value. It should be seen as another facet of any brand that has a high emotional connection with its customers.”\n\nFor Robbins, the lessons are the same for an IP-based film as with any other. “Treat the audience with respect. Moviegoers will not rush out to continuously support something just because of the brand… There has to be a human connection with the characters and the story, or any initial box office success might be short-lived,” he adds. “It’s a tightrope walk.”\n\nAlthough Mattel appears to have struck gold by reimagining its Barbie brand for a millennial audience, not all CEOs should see the movie tie-in as the route to their own Malibu Dreamhouse. “You’ve only got one chance to do this,” Scaman says. “If it doesn’t go well, it can be a disaster.”"

Yeah, we had been in *** very safe bubble with uh in Barbie Land and then we were out in the real world, they just rip the band aid off real fast do in head first.

The demand for products has been high ever since, and through WGSN’s data forecast, we saw early indicators that #BarbiePink was gaining traction in all regions.\n\nWGSN first highlighted Hyper Pink as a trend at the S/S 19 London Fashion Week\n\nIn the short term, we expect #HyperPink hues to trend on social deeper into the summer, in line with the release of the Barbie movie on the 21st of July. Google searches show “Barbie pink” gaining interest again. Our Women’s Spring analysis report also notes that mentions of “Barbie pink” on social media grew 21% YoY.\n\nMentions of Barbie pink peaked on social media in October 2022 and spiked again in April 2023 when the Barbie trailer was released / Source: WGSN, February – April 2023 and 2022\n\nDespite the social buzz, sales momentum slows for Hyper Pink\n\nWGSN e-commerce data shows that Barbie pink products are performing below average. The hyper-bright era is on the wane as a more sombre mood took hold following the post-pandemic euphoria, which saw hyper-brights have their moment.\n\nKoche, Paris Fashion Week Spring/Summer 23\n\nAt WGSN, we collect and classify product data from major global e-commerce sites, including product descriptions, price, promotions and availability, enabling us to assess the strength of trends over time.\n\nWe see that retailers have been increasing the amount of bright pink products this summer by 1pp compared with last year, however more of these products are being discounted than the apparel average, with only 9% of them going out-of-stock at full price (vs a 13% apparel average). Categories where bright pinks are performing are jumpsuits, trousers and sleepwear.\n\nWGSN / Fashion Week Streets\n\nGoing forward, retailers should pull back bright pink volumes and take a tactical category and item approach to discounting what they have, in order to protect margins.\n\nWith WGSN data, we are able to capture trends ahead of big cultural shifts and consumer conversations such as the Barbie movie, and help figure out the next move for your business.

        "text": "Mark Ronson is showing off his Barbies.\n\nScattered throughout his studio, the executive producer of the “Barbie” soundtrack — and a musical polymath known for his work with artists like Amy Winehouse and Lady Gaga — has a few “leftovers” scattered across the room. One doll is placed in a permanent split, stretched across a Moog synthesizer. Another is styled to look like primatologist Jane Goodall.\n\n“I went to Toys R Us and I couldn’t find a single Ken,” he laughs. Fittingly, “that’s the theme of the movie.” Mattel HQ did end up sending over a few; the Ken that remains in Ronson’s studio is, appropriately, shirtless.\n\nFinding the sound of “Barbie,” poised to become one of 2023’s biggest blockbusters, required careful consideration and research for a film with such a rich visual palette. In the end, he produced a stacked soundtrack that included Lizzo, Billie Eilish, Dua Lipa (who also acts in the movie) and more.\n\nBut it started with a simple text message.\n\nThe music supervisor on the project, George Drakoulias, shot Ronson a quick, “Barbie?” Ronson read the script and was in. He also scored “Barbie” with collaborator Andrew Wyatt. Ronson is no stranger to working on music for film, but executive producing a soundtrack album and scoring an entire movie, let alone, a movie of this size, was new territory. “It was a lot of learning on the job,” he says.\n\nThe soundtrack assignment began with two tracks: a pop song for a big dance number and an ’80s power ballad for Ken (name a genre with more “self-aware, bombastic silliness,” as Ronson calls it).\n\nThe former came first. Ronson came up with a chorus and beat — a detour from his first, far too obvious plan on writing “’80s, sugar-y pop,” and instead landing on a “groovy, melodic thing … with some toughness,” perfect for Dua Lipa. It became “Dance the Night,” the Lipa track featured in the film’s main trailer.\n\nThe Ken song came about differently. For the most part, Ronson works on instrumentals: When he wrote “Shallow” with Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper for “A Star Is Born,” for example, he only contributed lyrics to fill in gaps — the “surface, don’t hurt us,” line, as he recalls. But for the song that would become Ryan Gosling’s “I’m Just Ken,” Ronson couldn’t shake the lyric: “I’m just Ken, anywhere else I’d be a 10.”\n\nSo he sent director Greta Gerwig a demo with a few lines — including a deliciously mouthy lyric about “blonde fragility.” She sent it to Gosling, who plays Ken in the film, and knew immediately he needed to sing it. What could have soundtracked any scene in the film became its own musical moment.\n\nEarly on, Gerwig used the Bee Gees and ’70s discos as a reference point for Ronson.\n\n“You know the Chicago (Disco Demolition) thing, where everyone burned their disco records, “Saturday Night Fever” had reached its apex and the poor Bee Gees were like, ‘All we wanted to do was make people dance! What did we do wrong?’” says Ronson. “That’s ‘Barbie.’”\n\nIf anything, that idea is more of a thematic one than a sonic guideline. The mood board was vast, and also included “Dolly Parton, Olivia Newton John, ‘Nine to Five,’” Ronson explains.\n\nIt speaks to why the “Barbie” soundtrack spans pop genres, including a reggaeton track courtesy of Karol G, “Watati,” bubblegum K-pop from girl group Fifty Fifty featuring Kaliii in “Barbie Dreams,” and the falsetto-led piano ballad “What Was I Made For?” by Billie Eilish.\n\nFor Atlantic Records, who released the soundtrack, collaboration and diversity was key.\n\n“All of these artists were brought in early on to do screenings with Mark, Greta, and the filmmakers. They would see scenes they were going to write their music to,” says Brandon Davis, executive vice president and co-head of pop A&R at the label. “Each of these artists wrote lyrics about the specific ways Barbie was important to them.”\n\nRonson echoes the sentiment.\n\n“Karol G was like, ‘I’m here because I love Barbie. I wasn’t expecting this incredible film. This is awesome,’” he says. “And HAIM had this encyclopedic knowledge. The only VHS they were allowed in the ’90s, when they were kids, was this one Barbie thing. They knew every song.”\n\nOthers were tasked with a prompt: Lizzo’s “Pink”, which ends with a voiceover from Helen Mirren, was inspired by the lead Barbie, played by Margot Robbie, living through her perfect day. And because the film is a comedy with real-world complications, humor informed a lot of the songwriting: It’s in Dominic Fike’s “Hey Blondie” as well as the many samples of Charli XCX’s “Speed Drive.”\n\n“(Soundtracks) are an area where we cracked the code and figured out how to make it work in a way where we support our partners creatively,” says Kevin Weaver, president of Atlantic Records West Coast, citing Atlantic’s work on other major soundtracks like from the “Fast & Furious” franchise, “The Fault in Our Stars,” and “ The Greatest Showman,” which produced massive hits like Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth’s “See You Again,” Charli XCX’s “Boom Clap,” and “This Is Me,” respectively.\n\nBut unlike those films, part of the acquisition process for “Barbie” required a trip to the doll factory, where Atlantic executives got to witness the doll-making process from inception to completion. (Davis and Weaver are both producers on the soundtrack.)\n\nWhen working with legendary intellectual property, a soundtrack comes with some risks. Do you bring back Aqua’s 1997 hit “Barbie Girl,” or do you reimagine it? Surely Nicki Minaj must be featured — her fans are called Barbz.\n\n“I remember — no offense — that I had a song on the “Ghostbusters” remake and I think six of the 12 songs were reinterpretations of Ray Parker Jr.(’s “Ghostbusters” theme),” says Ronson. “It all dovetailed into the single we have with Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice,” he continued, referencing the reworking of “Barbie Girl.”\n\n“I’ve never really executive produced something before,” Ronson says. “I love this film. We had an amazing partner in Atlantic Records.”\n\n“And then doing the score, but it was a lot of learning on the job. It was still a job that I’ve never really done before. … It’s fun to show people different scenes and getting them to dream big.”"

The review criticized the film about the iconic doll of abandoning its core audience of families and little girls to instead focus on LGBTQ stories.\n\n\"The new BARBIE movie forgets its core audience of families and children while catering to nostalgic adults and pushing lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender character stories. Furthermore, the movie was poorly made with multiple premises, losing even the most die-hard fans,\" the scathing staff review-penned piece began.\n\n\"They had a built-in market and audience for this franchise that they completely ignored,\" the story continued. \"Millions of families would have turned out to the theaters and purchased tickets, but instead, Mattel chose to cater to a small percentage of the population who has proven over and over to abandon the box office.\"\n\nOSCAR-WINNING SCREENWRITER LEFT FAILED SONY ‘BARBIE’ MOVIE BECAUSE STUDIO WANTED ‘GIRL-BOSS FEMINIST TWIST'\n\nHowever actress Margot Robbie defended the film in a recent interview, saying it was \"literally crafted to be for everyone.\"\n\n\"This is such a thing people say when they do press for a movie. They’re like, ‘It’s for everyone.’ But it was literally crafted to be for everyone,\" Robbie said after being asked if the film was made for kids. Director Greta Gerwig crafted humor aimed at children and adults, the film's star further explained.\n\nHowever, members of the cast and crew have praised the film's left-leaning messages on gender in media interviews.\n\n\"It most certainly is a feminist film,\" Gerwig said to ABC News Australia. \"It's feminist in a way that includes everyone,\" she elaborated.\n\nBARBIE STAR SAYS FILM TESTS ‘HETERONORMATIVE’ IDEA OF GENDER, OFFERS ‘SCATHING CRITIQUES’ OF ICONIC DOLL\n\nTransgender actor Hari Nef, who plays a \"Doctor Barbie\" told Out Magazine that the film had an empowering message about being transgender.\n\n\"As much as there’s a celebration of femininity and being a girl in this [movie], I think there’s also an encouragement of letting go of the checklist we ascribe to living and living your life and being in your body your way, on your own terms,\" Nef said.\n\nStar Simu Liu has also praised the film for deconstructing \"heteronormative\" gender roles about toys and colors.\n\n\"And I’m so glad that this movie exists because I think it puts the final nail in the coffin of that very heteronormative idea of what gender is, and what is or is not gendered,\" he said during an interview with Screen Rant’s Joe Deckelmeier.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile discussing the film's feminist themes with Fandango, actress and \"Saturday Night Live\" alum Kate McKinnon revealed she knew she wanted to be in the film after reading about how the script deconstructs gender roles.\n\n\"I knew it was going to be something and then I read it, and it was like, sort of about how like gender roles deny people half their humanity and how like we need to just like be ourselves,\" McKinnon said.\n\nCo-star Issa Rae praised the film for sidelining Barbie's male counterpart, \"Ken\", to be an \"accessory\" for Barbie.\n\nRae told interview host Naz Perez, \"I think a Ken for me is just kind of there. I think a Ken is just a great accessory. That’s what I loved about Greta’s imagining of Barbie is that the Kens are just supplemental characters to these Barbies.\"\n\nWarner Bros.

        "text": "Hari Nef — the trans actress from Philadelphia — plays one of the Barbies in Greta Gerwig's new film about the doll starring Margot Robbie. But conservatives are angry about Nef's role. Read more\n\nOn the heels of its premiere, Greta Gerwig’s highly anticipated Barbie film is already drawing criticism from some conservative crowds. And at the center of those critics’ disapproval is Philly-born actress Hari Nef.\n\nIn Barbie, a string of Barbies and Kens live in Barbieland and share the same names. Each Barbie and Ken takes on a different personality and role. The main Barbie is played by Margot Robbie and the main Ken by Ryan Gosling. But other notable actors playing the respective dolls include Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Dua Lipa, Simu Liu, and John Cena.\n\nNef, who is known for her roles in And Just Like That... and Transparent and was the first trans woman signed by IMG Models, plays one of the Barbies. Nef’s inclusion and some of the feminist themes in Gerwig’s Barbie have been praised as a diverse and empowering portrayal of the iconic doll. But far-right personalities and commentators see it differently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n» READ MORE: Philly-born transgender model is breaking down fashion barriers\n\nLast week, a review by the Christian site Movieguide slammed the film for including queer talent.\n\n“The new Barbie movie forgets its core audience of families and children while catering to nostalgic adults and pushing lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender character stories,” read the article — which is titled “WARNING: Don’t Take Your Daughter to Barbie.” Fox News has since quoted the review.\n\nGinger Gaetz, the wife of U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R., Fla.) criticized the film after attending its premiere this week, saying that it “unfortunately neglects to address any notion of faith or family.” She went on to call Ken’s portrayal “disappointingly low T” — suggesting low testosterone levels — and a “beta” male, not an alpha.\n\nAs noted by the LGBTQ+ digital magazine, them, a video of a pastor condemning Barbie for being full of “transsexual and transgender homosexuality” went viral online.\n\nRight-wing commentators Charlie Kirk and Ben Shapiro both slammed Nef’s casting ahead of the film’s release.\n\nStill, those involved with the making of Barbie say fearmongering over a “trans Barbie” is just that.\n\nIn an interview with Attitude, Robbie confirmed the dolls don’t have sexualities — because, well, they’re dolls.\n\n“They don’t actually have sexual orientations because they don’t have reproductive organs,” she said. Still, when casting, Robbie — who is also one of the movie’s producers — and Gerwig wanted to make sure Barbieland was inclusive. “It was so important that every person that was coming aboard the party would be able to represent someone else that could be watching this movie.”\n\nAlong with Nef, other LGBTQ+ cast members include Kate McKinnon, Alexandra Shipp, and Scott Evans.\n\nIn an interview with Out, Nef said she wasn’t cast because she was trans — adding that the film’s executive producer said he didn’t know Nef was trans in the first place.\n\n» READ MORE: Why is ‘Barbenheimer’ having such a cultural moment?\n\n“It’s probably positive for Mattel to include me in this because we’re trying to show all different kinds of Barbies, but that’s not why I got the role,” she said. “I got the role because I fit the role. To be honest, I don’t look much different in the movie than the Barbies that I had when I was a kid.”\n\nStill, Out reported that the movie has a strong message for trans women about “the beauty of being a person rather than an ideal.”\n\n“I think as a trans girl, it’s easy to get caught up in big dreams of what you’ll become. And it’s inevitable that you’ll get struck down by external messages and obstacles of what you’ll never be and what you won’t be able to do. You’re caught constantly between striving for perfection and recoiling from rejection. It’s hard,” Nef said.\n\n“As much as there’s a celebration of femininity and being a girl in this [movie], I think there’s also an encouragement of letting go of the checklist we ascribe to living and living your life and being in your body your way, on your own terms,” she said. “The best that we can do as women, as trans women, is be there for each other and take ourselves at face value, without relying on the green light from someone or anyone else.”\n\nDespite the anti-Barbie wave and a hashtag to #BoycottBarbie (which has gained little traction), Barbie is expected to bring in an estimated $95 to $105 million opening weekend, Variety reports."

(Photo by Rodin Eckenroth/WireImage)\n\nBarbie is one of the most highly-anticipated movies of the summer! The film about America’s favorite plastic doll hits theaters on July 21st with Oscar-nominated actress Margot Robbie stepping into the heels of the iconic doll, while fellow Oscar-nominated actor Ryan Gosling portrays Barbie’s boyfriend Ken.\n\nAside from Robbie and Gosling, the film has an all-star cast that includes Issa Rae, America Ferrera, Kate McKinnon, Michael Cera, and Simu Liu. The cast has been busy doing promotional tours for the upcoming release and sharing secrets about production and having fun filming the movie, but they didn’t let the fun stop after the cameras stopped rolling.\n\nThe Barbie cast bonded during sleepovers and pink days while on set\n\nThe Barbie film has been gaining a lot of buzz as fans eagerly await to see the fun adventures of Barbie, Ken, and their friends. The making of the film was a fun experience for the cast, who became fast friends.\n\nIn an interview with People, the group revealed how they bonded when they were away from the set. Before filming started, Robbie hosted a sleepover with the other actors, according to Liu.\n\n“Margot was so great. She had a sleepover with the Barbies before photography started, and the Kens were allowed to either visit briefly or to phone in and say hi.”\n\nAside from sleepovers, the cast also attended movie nights at Robbie’s house. The actress made sure her co-stars had a fun time and found a unique way for them to raise money for charity. According to Gosling, Robbie implemented pink days to help raise money for a good cause.\n\n“Margot had this pink day once a week, where everyone had to wear something pink. And if you didn’t, you were fined. She would go around collecting the fines, and she would donate it to a charity.”\n\nGosling revealed that the crew also got in on the action with the pink dress code.\n\n“What was really special was just how excited the male crew members were. At the end of the film, they all got together and, with their own money, made pink crew shirts with rainbow fringe. It was this opportunity for them to show their respect and admiration for what Margot and Greta Gerwig were creating.”\n\nLooks like the project was a fun experience for both the cast and crew. Fans will get to see the final product when Barbie premieres in theaters nationwide on July 21, 2023.\n\nAre you excited for the film?

Love her or hate her (for many of us, it’s more complicated than that), you know her.

Every time I played with Christie, I made her exactly like my cool older sister, but with a career as a world-renowned fashion designer. My mom would let me cut up socks and doll clothes so that I could make the outfits in my imagination come to life. Although my designs never turned out great, I will never forget being able to live out my dream job as a kid through my favorite doll — who also looked like me and every woman around me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n— ADRIA WATSON\n\n1979 Barbie and Ken dolls Mattel\n\nPoor Ken. In Barbie’s world, he ranked between “left shoe” and “pool slide” as her most important accessory. He had no dream house or car and was saddled with a wardrobe straight out of the International Male catalog.\n\nBut I’m happy to say that in my childhood home, in the 1970s, Ken found status, meaning, and love. He made his way from my sister’s Barbie collection into the welcoming embrace of my G.I. Joe action figure.\n\nJoe, who had recently redecorated his camper (with my help) after an extended tour in Vietnam, was looking to share his abode on wheels with a new pal. Ken was more than happy for the companionship. They made a beautiful couple. Their adventures in my backyard included picking raspberries from the overgrown briar patch to make coulis for their cheesecake and gossiping about Barbie’s poor taste in satin jumpsuits.\n\nThey shared everything, even the single bed in Joe’s camper. Thankfully my sister never noticed Ken’s mysterious disappearance from her toy chest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n— CHRISTOPHER MUTHER\n\n1978 Country Camper Barbie vehicle Mattel\n\nWhen I was growing up in the ‘90s in Karachi, Pakistan, Barbie was the elite toy my uncle brought me and my cousins from America. Once I moved to Canada a few years later, I could pick out my favorites from the store myself: Cool Clips Barbie had super-long hair and pink and blue color-changing hair clips I could put in my own hair, too.\n\nOther faves were an Indian Barbie in a sari; two princess Barbies (accidentally bought a duplicate) where one was the evil twin because I messed up her hair; and another Barbie that came with a cat that could pee in a litter box. My beloved dolls are still stored in a large bin at my parents’ house. Its blue lid hasn’t served as a pool in nearly two decades.\n\n— SAHAR FATIMA\n\nA miniature VIP ticket that came with one Barbie doll is an example of the extremely tiny accessories that often accompany the popular toys — and get easily lost. Steve Annear\n\nI’d mostly avoided Barbie interactions for 38 years, having grown up in a household in the 1980s and ′90s with two boys who loved “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” and “Ghostbusters.” But now that I have a 5-year-old daughter, who has become enamored of the dolls after they were gifted to her one birthday, there is a large pink house inside my tiny apartment that takes up most of our living room. There are also Barbies lying half-clothed in the tub, and Barbies spilling out of a basket now affectionately known as the Barbie Basket.\n\nMy Barbie voice during playtime is high-pitched and subpar, and my patience for locating the teeny-tiny accessories — a VIP ticket the size of a tick; rogue sneakers and little pet turtles; a minuscule chalk bag for Sport Climbing Barbie — when my daughter loses them is waning. Luckily, she also likes Ninja Turtles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n— STEVE ANNEAR\n\n1962 Barbie Dreamhouse Mattel\n\nI didn’t really have Barbies growing up. My older sister had one — “Kissing Barbie,” with a button on her back you could push to make smooching noises — but my doll of choice was Strawberry Shortcake. I was (and am!) more interested in cakes and pies than bust measurements and clothes, and Strawberry Shortcake dolls also came with animal familiars, which was a draw for me.\n\nI did play with Kissing Barbie because our stock of dolls was limited (toys were a lot more expensive in the ′80s), but she always looked extremely out of place in our shoebox dollhouse with her weeny outfits. A lot of our play plotlines involved making Barbie the scapegoat for everything that went wrong, or casting her as an airhead, or marrying her to Strawberry Shortcake’s evil nemesis, the Purple Pieman. I don’t think I ever thought of her as a standard of beauty — blond, for some unfair reason, was synonymous with stupidity to us, and being smart was important in our family.\n\n— FRANCIE LIN\n\n1978 Ken doll Mattel\n\nIn 1978 I was living my best 5-year-old life, peacefully at play with Matchbox cars — until Barbie busted into my life in a riot of pink.\n\nOur neighbor’s Dreamhouse became my obsession. Mom noticed and tried to curb my interest. Traditional gender roles and aggressive masculinity were tenets of family life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuying Ken was her wish for me to be bullied less. Instead he became my ticket into the Dreamhouse, where I abandoned him for Barbie.\n\n— OMAR VEGA\n\nFrom left: Kingsley Ben-Adir as Ken, Ryan Gosling as Ken, and Ncuti Gatwa as Ken in Warner Bros. Pictures’ “Barbie.\" Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nI recall feeling a sense of pride around not typically playing with Barbie dolls as a child. With an older brother and mostly male friends, I’d always wanted to be “one of the boys,” hence my rejection of the feminine toy. But now, in adulthood, I find myself eager for the release of the “Barbie” movie in all its hot-pink frivolousness. I am a child of the early 2000s, so Barbie is my birthright, and I can’t wait to shamelessly, finally, unwrap her.\n\n— DANA GERBER\n\nMargot Robbie as Barbie in Warner Bros. Pictures’ \"Barbie.\" Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nBarbie was not part of my childhood in the 1970s. However, she’s part of my life now. I played Drag Queen Bingo at New York’s Stonewall Inn a few Mondays ago. I won a round! The drag queen mocked my film critic job — ”your mother must be so proud!” — and my prize was a Disney Princess Barbie. I chose Princess Tiana, because her movie has a character named Mama Odie. I never win anything, so I’m keeping this doll!\n\n— ODIE HENDERSON\n\nAshlee Korlach drives a pink Barbie Corvette around a cul-de-sac as her father watches. Ashlee Korlach\n\nWhen I was the perfect age to drive a bright pink, toddler-sized Barbie Corvette, I was a Barbie girl through and through, cruising the cul-de-sac in style. There would be many dolls after them, but Barbies were the first dolls my sister and I had in the late ‘90s/early 2000s. I’ve gone through phases since then — like resenting Barbie, as a budding feminist — but I’ve come back to loving all things Barbie as I await the movie.\n\n— ASHLEE KORLACH\n\n1980 Black Barbie Mattel\n\nOne of my early Barbie dolls was her friend Christie. She was Black, like me, but she was an adult who was long-legged, shapely, and glamorous. Christie had on a gown that Diana Ross or Donna Summer would wear and big ′70s feathered hair with a cool blond streak. I wanted to be Christie because she personified all the elegant and beautiful Black women I emulated.\n\nSoon, I began to request Barbie dolls with careers that inspired me. I had a ballerina Barbie, a doctor Barbie, and a Day-to-Night Barbie. I also owned several Barbies who represented expansive diversity and beauty ideals that followed the trends of the times: Black Barbie (the very first “Black” Barbie doll with the Barbie name, released in 1980), the winking Western Barbie, and Magic Curl Barbie, whose hair went from curly afro to straight with the aid of a magic mist straightening powder.\n\nI also owned many of her accessories that completed the promise of her fabulous adult life: her three-story townhouse, pink Corvette, pool, and Golden Palomino horse named Dallas. I saw my dolls going places and accomplishing big goals. Barbie was the mini-me — the me who was still yet to be.\n\nToday, I still “play” with Barbie, only now I’m a doll collector. I purchase many of the limited-edition Barbie dolls, and I am also buying back the older, vintage Barbie dolls I had in my youth. After all these years, I still love Barbie.\n\n— RONKE IDOWU REEVES\n\nThe box for a 1997 Happy Holidays Barbie that remains unopened. Marie Piard\n\nI played with Barbie during the 1990s and was obsessed with all things Mattel. The doll aisle at Toys “R” Us was my fortress. I had her Jeep, Corvette, and Dreamhouse (I was that girl). In 1997, as a gift from Mom, I got a Happy Holidays Barbie. She was too perfect. Even as a kid, I knew it would one day be very special, so I did the impossible: I never opened the box. To calm my excitement about having her, I slit open a small section of the back panel so I could feel the red and gold dress with my pinky. I still have the mostly unopened box.\n\n— MARIE PIARD\n\nNews Anchor Barbie poses in front of the linotype in the lobby of The Boston Globe, ready for a day of reporting with her microphone. Karissa Korman for The Boston Globe\n\nMy Slack picture is and has been a 60th-anniversary journalist Barbie. I have her at my desk. News Anchor Barbie came with a small microphone, heels, and a blue statement necklace (all things journalists need, clearly). I bought her as well as a tiny pink laptop, tiny pink iPhone, and tiny pink iPad. She also has a small Starbucks drink.\n\n— MADDIE MORTELL\n\n1961 Austin Healey Barbie car Mattel\n\nI pulled the dolls one by one from the box — festive, holiday Barbies to celebrate Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Their gleaming faces were the idols of my childhood in the 1990s, early lessons in makeup and beauty. Constructing their lives became foundational for my love of narrative, a first foray into theater. Barbies cemented a decades-long friendship with the girl who lived down the street.\n\nI held one out to my 5-year-old daughter, expectation and joy in the palm of my hand.\n\nShe eyed it warily.\n\n“No thanks,” she said.\n\n— JESSICA BARTLETT"

He also knew he didn’t want to propose in front of a typical landmark. He wanted a spot that felt iconic but unique, a place that felt like the Washington they knew, not the Washington that was known.\n\nThat’s how the two ended up standing in front of a house on Q Street in Northwest D.C. one evening last year, looking at the latest display in the Barbie Pond.\n\nDuring the early days of the pandemic, the couple had walked by the garden-sized body of water and seen Barbie and her crew posed in all sorts of ways that reflected current events, holidays and movies. In April 2020, two dolls in boxing gloves stood in a ring fighting the coronavirus. In October of that year, zombie-appearing dolls lurked in that space. A month later, dolls resembling President Biden and Vice President Harris stood against a backdrop of the White House surrounded by Barbies holding signs that indicated they had voted.\n\nOn the day Looney planned to propose, he and Benjamin walked from their home in Dupont Circle to the restaurant Le Diplomate. After they finished dinner, as he had done many times before, Looney suggested they check out what Barbie was up to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen they arrived at the pond, they found a large wooden cake with Barbie and Ken on top. Barbie wore a wedding dress and Ken donned the clothes of a prince. In his hands, he held a sign that read, “Emma, Will You Marry Me?”\n\nA video taken of that moment by the men who created the display (after receiving a letter from Looney) shows Benjamin jumping up and down after she realizes what is happening.\n\n“My goal was to try to find something quintessentially D.C. without the monuments or the politics or the White House,” Looney, 29, told me on a recent afternoon. The Barbie Pond allowed him to achieve that, he said. “If you’ve never lived in Dupont, you might have no idea what the Barbie Pond is. But for those who have lived there, it’s such a staple of the community.”\n\nThe highly anticipated release of the Barbie movie has been bringing much attention lately to the iconic doll and all her pink accessories. In the D.C. region, bars, beer gardens and theaters have planned events that play to the theme. For people with dogs, there is even a “Barbie Yappy Hour” that promises to have cocktails, games and a costume contest.\n\nBut before the rest of the country started obsessing about Barbie, many D.C. residents knew where they could find Barbie putting on a show. At the Barbie Pond, she has long been a star.\n\nThree longtime friends create the installations at the pond, and over the years, they have mostly avoided public attention. They have declined most media interview requests in the past. But this isn’t just any moment. This is Barbie’s moment. So, I reached out to them recently. They agreed to share the story of the pond on the condition that I identify them by only their first names — Craig, Jon and Brent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first thing you should know about the men, who are in their 40s and 50s, is that they don’t take themselves too seriously. They laugh — a lot — at their displays and at themselves.\n\n“We are three grown men playing with Barbies, and we’re totally comfortable with that,” Craig told me. “The running joke between us is ‘Is it time to hang it up?’ We’re not really serious because we get so much joy out of it. We also keep getting feedback from people that it means something to them, and we don’t want to let them down.”\n\nThe work at the pond started small and without consistency. The homeowner, Brent, put some cake toppers in that space, and it drew some laughs. He then kept placing figures there and eventually started using Barbies. Craig and Jon joined the effort about a decade ago, and the three now regularly work together to create the scenes. They try to put up a new one each month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCraig said it’s especially helpful that Jon is a carpenter: “Otherwise it would all be made out of duct tape, hopes and prayers.”\n\nShare this article Share\n\nJon turned a toy car into a moon rover for a display that honored the 50th anniversary of the moon landing, and he built an Eiffel Tower for a display that gave a nod to the show “Emily in Paris.”\n\nOther displays have shown Barbie and her crew celebrating Cinco de Mayo, Pride month and Hanukkah. There have been Barbies in drag and Barbies wrapped in American flags. There have been Ken dolls that appear pregnant. That display went up after the U.S. Supreme Court decided to overturn Roe v. Wade. A sign next to those Ken dolls read, “Things Would Be Different IF …”\n\nThe men post videos of all the displays on an Instagram page, and their latest creation has drawn the highest online engagement yet. More than 50,000 users have viewed it. That installation features a Supreme Court made up of nine women seated in front of an American flag and a sign that reads “#Goals.” The song that plays with it: “Not Ready to Make Nice” by the Chicks.\n\n“Best Barbie pond ever!!” reads one of the comments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Amen to that!!” reads a second.\n\n“You never disappoint! Brilliant!” reads yet another.\n\nI asked Craig whether the displays draw much hate, either in person or online. He said they surprisingly don’t. He said the Instagram page has accumulated more than 30,000 followers, and many of the people who live near the pond are protective of it. People have even left dolls and thank-you notes at the site.\n\n“The biggest surprise has been the people from out of town,” he said. “Every once in a while, we’ll get people from across the country and even other parts of the world, and they will tell us that the pond was on their list of things to see.”\n\nHe described that as “mind boggling” in a voice filled with awe. He said they never expected a little pond with Barbie dolls to come to mean something to so many people.\n\nThey never expected it to become a permanent part of a couple’s story."

        "text": "Tom Cruise knows how to sell tickets—even to other people’s movies. “This summer is full of amazing movies to see in theaters,” the Mission: Impossible star wrote on Instagram recently, while he and director Christopher McQuarrie posed with tickets in front of posters for rival films. Cruise congratulated Harrison Ford for “creating one of the most iconic characters in cinema history” with Indiana Jones, and identified himself as one of the many people who’d make a double feature out of Oppenheimer and Barbie, which will go head-to-head in theaters as of July 21. His act of goodwill proved to be contagious, as he must have hoped it would. A few days later, Barbie director Greta Gerwig and star Margot Robbie tweeted their own photo shoot, in which they also waved tickets to their rivals: “Mission: Accepted!”\n\nSummer box office used to be the ultimate showbiz blood sport. Now, publicly at least, it’s all kumbaya and collegiality, which says a lot about the industry’s enduring post-pandemic fears. Beneath the gracious social media shoutouts is a pervasive sense that if the public doesn’t fall back in love with in-person moviegoing for good now, the bottom will continue to fall out of the studio system and take stars down in the process. So far, summer 2023 has proven to be a bumpy ride. Sure-things have struggled, surprise sleepers have failed to emerge, and pressure is mounting on a handful of July titles to save the season.\n\nBox office watchers are still predicting that movies like Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One and Barbie can help summer ticket sales in the US and Canada hit $4 billion, which would be taken as a sign that the industry has indeed recovered from an anemic three years. But a trail of early underperformers—including DC’s The Flash, Pixar’s Elemental, and Indy’s fifth and final outing, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny—has only stoked worries. With his cheerleading post, Cruise, the man who “saved Hollywood’s ass” last summer with Top Gun: Maverick, is attempting to stage a rescue mission again. This time he’ll have some help from Barbie and the atomic bomb.\n\nHollywood power brokers are watching all this closely, to say the least. “I was very excited after Super Mario Bros., and then I got a little more concerned after the last four weeks,” says producer Jason Blum, best known for low-cost horror hits Paranormal Activity, Insidious, and M3GAN. “The movie business has in no way bounced back like the live events business has, but I really think that it’s a matter of time.” Few expect earnings to surpass summer 2019 levels—when 32 films brought in $4.34 billion—but anything close will be a win. The industry is used to absorbing bad news—and hoping for last-minute salvation. “Not everything works,” says another studio executive poring over summer ticket sales, “but that’s just the movie business.”\n\nThere are reasons to be at least optimism-adjacent. Moviegoers still want to see spectacle—and they are willing to pay extra to see it on premium large-format screens. “2023 has definitely been a much fuller slate than pre-pandemic times,” says IMAX CEO Richard Gelfond. “And for us, it’s even a little more intense because the audience has shifted more to premium on a global basis. IMAX’s market share went up by 50% in North America and it’s gone up by about 40% globally. So it’s not only more competition within the industry, it’s more competition for IMAX screens. We think our box office will be similar to 2019.”\n\nSimilar is the new amazing.\n\nMoviegoers signaled that they were ready to return to theaters last summer when they showed up in droves for Top Gun: Maverick, the top performer of the year with a staggering $719 million in US ticket sales, and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which outperformed 2016’s Doctor Strange. But the robust performance of a handful of titles belied ongoing challenges. Last winter, as one Oscar contender after another died gasping at the box office, a senior awards strategist told Vanity Fair, “the audience is just not there anymore for these sorts of movies.” One obstacle was simply a volume problem: Even though tentpoles like Avatar: The Way of Water were dominating the weekend, there just weren’t enough movies in theaters.\n\nThis summer, every weekend offers multiple options, and they’re often aimed at disparate demographics, as with the showdown referred to in some quarters as “Barbenheimer.” Since May 5, when Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 dropped, there’s been a steady beat of new releases, among them The Little Mermaid, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, and Transformers: Rise of the Beasts. The major studios are expected to release 42 films widely across the country by Labor Day weekend. One studio executive moans about all this in a way that sounds almost nostalgic: “It’s such a crowded summer.”\n\nBefore Cruise began his goodwill campaign, the actor was involved in a behind-the-scenes fight for IMAX screens, according to Puck. His latest Mission: Impossible outing will play on IMAX screens for about a week, but then must give them up for Oppenheimer, which debuts a week later on July 21 and has all the screens exclusively booked for three weeks. That has little to do with earnings expectations, and everything to do with relationships. Nolan, a longtime IMAX champion, had struck a deal long before with the exhibitor to guarantee that his movie would play on those screens, regardless of who else parachuted into the market on a motorcycle.\n\nIMAX’s Gelfond tells VF that he worked closely with Nolan and Universal on Oppenheimer’s release date more than a year ago. He visited the Mission: Impossible set and is “a huge fan of Tom’s,” he says, but this is the bottom line: “We made a commitment to Chris. Obviously, I think the movie’s going to be great, but irrespective, we honor our commitments.”\n\nExecutives worried about a crowded schedule are one sign that movies are back, baby. “We’ve had really big films since reopening from the pandemic, like Avatar and Top Gun and Spider-Man, but now we’re talking about many titles,” says Elizabeth Frank, the executive in charge of programming AMC Entertainment’s more than 10,000 screens. “People are saying, ‘Well, which one do you want to see first?’ And that’s a different level of excitement. In an industry where momentum is really important, it’s an opportunity for us to build back habitual moviegoing.”\n\nIn Hollywood, the weekend box office is treated with the same seriousness as the World Series. “I have a group of friends, we get together at the beginning of the year and we have a draft, we pick all the movies for the year, and points are awarded based on Metacritic score, based on box office, based on awards, and based on profitability,” says Blum, whose company, Blumhouse, has Insidious: The Red Door out on July 7. “We text each other every Thursday or Friday. I’m currently in second place.”\n\nGuys like Blum no doubt pay closer attention to movie ticket sales than the average American, but even he has noticed that more people are following the money as they did years ago. “The box office derby is one of those things that everyone can be a part of,” says Paul Dergarabedian, an entertainment industry analyst for Comscore. “Not everyone has played professional sports or ridden a horse professionally or driven a race car, but we can all sit in a movie theater.”\n\nMore scrutiny, of course, means more headlines when movies stumble. For every winner like Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (with its $356 million in domestic grosses) or Spider Man: Across the Spider-Verse ($346 million), there’s something like The Flash, which has pulled a meager $102 million in the US in spite of its reported $200 million budget, or Elemental, whose $29.6 million debut was considered a major flop for Disney’s Pixar. Meanwhile, Dial of Destiny, which reportedly cost $295 million, arguably needed to make a lot more over Fourth of July than it did. One bright spot? Studios are focusing more on profitability, which Blum contends, “everyone forgot about for about five years.” Now, he says, there’s more pressure to rein in costs: “The budget conversation was the last conversation when you were introducing new projects to buyers. Now it’s the first, which makes me happy because I think less expensive movies are often better and more interesting.”\n\nEven before June gloom hit the box office, Hollywood had largely put its faith in Mission: Impossible, Barbie, and Oppenheimer to carry ticket sales. Now it’s even more imperative that all three titles find their audiences. Early tracking—which pegs the Mission: Impossible opening at around $90 million, Barbie somewhere north of $70 million, and Oppenheimer around $40 million—suggests that they will. Though Ethan Hunt will likely be the biggest star of the summer, media attention has focused squarely on the matchup between Barbie and Oppenheimer.\n\n“I do think a rising tide lifts all boats,” says a top film agent. “When we have pictures in theaters that start to feel like they’re ‘watercooler’—which I really think the Barbie-Oppenheimer thing is becoming—it’s incredibly healthy for the box office, because what we’re doing is delivering an experience that people feel like was worth their time and money.”\n\nAMC has been preparing for the summer movie season by extending operating hours at its theaters, hiring more staff, and making sure its Icee dispensers are full. “Increasingly, fans of different films are also looking for movie-themed merchandise and movie-themed drinks,” says Frank. “It makes the moviegoing experience that much more engaging and dynamic. It’s a little complicated, though, to be moving in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle cups while you’re figuring out whether you’ve still got a bunch of people who want the Mission: Impossible ones or the Barbie ones.”\n\nPredicting the box office has always been like reading tea leaves or tarot cards. Even IMAX’s Gelfond admits to fixating on the returns—from the first night to the last. “Like a junkie,” he says. “I hate to admit it, but yes. Most of our movies open on Thursday nights because they’re big blockbusters. So by Friday morning, I’m on the phone with our distribution and marketing teams trying to understand what the weekend’s going to look like and what’s working and not working and why and why not.”\n\nIf you want to know how summer 2023 turns out, you’ll have to wait for the final reel."

        "text": "The new Barbie movie starring Margot Robbie has sparked fresh interest in all things Barbie, including collectibles. Mattel, Barbie’s maker, estimates there are well over 100,000 active collectors, many of whom attend the annual Barbie convention (held in early July this year in Orlando).\n\nWhen Barbie was introduced in 1959, I was 10 — too old, I thought, to play with dolls. Then, in 1995, I saw photos of a No. 1 Barbie and a trunkful of clothes found in an abandoned storage locker. I was hooked.\n\nAs I began collecting vintage dolls, it was interesting to see how Barbie’s hairstyles evolved in her early years — from a ponytail and curly bangs in the Elvis era, to a bouffant “bubblecut” when Jackie Kennedy was first lady to a sleek pageboy in the mid-‘60s and then to the long straight hair of the hippie and Mod generation.\n\nLooking to explore the Tampa Bay area?

At her peak of elegance in 1965, Barbie wore satin evening gowns, gold lame sheaths and tweed suits trimmed with real fur. Outfits had names like Shimmering Magic and Debutante Ball. And oh, the accessories — tiny compacts, pearl necklaces, even a portfolio with fashion sketches.\n\nThe oldest and generally most sought-after dolls were made in Japan. As that country became wealthier and labor costs rose, Barbie’s story tracked that of the world’s emerging markets — production moved to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Mexico, Malaysia, Indonesia and China.\n\nWith Barbie aging (albeit beautifully), prices for some of the earliest dolls have soared. At Marl and B, a Bradenton shop specializing in vintage Barbies, a No. 1 doll was recently listed at $15,000 and some bubblecuts as much as $1,500. (Prices on eBay tend to be less.) Condition is key. Bad hair, missing fingers and toes and the dreaded green ear — caused by metal earring posts interacting with the plastic in the doll’s head — dramatically affect value. As for the clothes, one way to spot the earliest ones is by their black-and-white embroidered tags. Accessories — often lost or sucked up in vacuum cleaners — can be scarcer and more valuable than the clothes.\n\nIn anticipation of the Barbie movie, a friend and I got out our vintage dolls. Maybe I was too old for Barbie at 10, but not anymore."

Weeks ahead of time, a group of friends and I sent one of our parents (probably my dad) to the movie theater (singular) in the county where I grew up to buy advance tickets to the opening-night midnight showing. Most of us liked the Harry Potter books, but we weren’t among the wild obsessives you imagine when you hear about Harry Potter fans. Still, we were excited.\n\nWe made T-shirts. Mine said, “Honk if you’re a Potthead.” (I had never smoked pot; I thought it was hilarious anyway.) A girlfriend of mine’s shirt said, “Show me that 11-inch wand, nice and supple,” a reference that several parents did not like to Harry’s magical wand in the book. We stood for hours in a line that snaked through the strip mall and into the parking lot, to make sure we could get seats together.\n\nI don’t think we even took a photo, which would be unheard of now. But in 2001, what were we even going to do with one? MySpace didn’t exist yet. There was no thought of memorializing the moment or trading it for online likes and clout. It was just… fun.\n\nI bring this up now, because the current widespread enthusiasm for the Barbie movie reminds me of that experience. Barbie is still two weeks from its July 21 release date, but is seemingly all anyone can talk about.\n\nObviously my Harry Potter story is a personal one. Maybe you have a similar memory related to the Twilight films, the Lord of the Rings franchise, a particular Marvel movie, or Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again. (OK, that last one might just be me.) It’s now a regular occurrence for an “event” release to take over the pop-culture news cycle, sell scores of advance tickets, and be greeted with people in costume to celebrate.\n\nIt’s at a point, thanks to social media and the rise of memes, where the enthusiasm has morphed into something ironic: the #GentleMinions phenomenon/fiasco, for example. That’s why I cherish my Harry Potter moviegoing experience. It was innocent and genuine, and I’ve loved seeing some of those earnest feelings return in the lead-up to the Barbie movie. It’s not that there haven’t been other examples of that type of anticipation for a new release. With Barbie, though, it seems to be on a whole other scale.\n\nThe unrelenting nature of this Barbie press and promo push is particularly remarkable in that, at least anecdotally, people don’t seem to be exhausted by or exasperated with it yet.\n\nThe on-set photos of stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling in their fluorescent costumes sparked a curiosity last year that not only hasn’t waned, but it also has helped set off a fireworks show of eager giddiness online whenever there’s a new trailer, clip, red carpet interview, or announcement about the film’s soundtrack. The reaction to an advanced clip of Gosling as Ken interacting with several of the film’s Barbies was akin to the viral footage of that time all of San Diego’s fireworks went off at once, which resurfaced over the holiday weekend. People loved it.\n\nPersonally, I don’t believe in hyperbole or over-exaggeration. That’s why I’ll merely say that, based on that 44-second clip, Gosling deserves to win Best Actor at the Oscars, or else the Academy should be legally forced to disband and each voter required to write handwritten letters to every American expressing their shame and begging for forgiveness.\n\nEach new stage of this Barbie press tour sets a new bar for what fans who have been following it would expect, and it has yet to disappoint.\n\nWere you expecting great fashion from the Barbie red carpets? Not only does Robbie look spectacular—rescuing what was a not-so-stellar red-carpet reputation, if we’re being kind—but each of the ensembles is also meticulously inspired by classic outfits worn by Barbie dolls.\n\nDid you think that Gosling would obviously be entertaining doing interviews in support of this film? Not only is he handsome and charming, but he is also more handsome and charming than I could have fantasized about. I watched a clip of an interview where he tells the male interviewer that he is “Kenough,” and now I am with child.\n\nAs for stunts: Maybe we should have predicted that someone would build an actual Barbie Dreamhouse in Malibu. Still, we were stunned when someone built an actual Barbie Dreamhouse in Malibu, which can be booked as an Airbnb. (Watch my colleague Fletcher Peters tour it here.) And should anyone be worried that the Barbie hype may not be reaching those who are not terminally online like me, HGTV will be airing Barbie Dreamhouse Challenge, where teams compete to makeover a home into a Barbie oasis. Now my parents can join in the fun.\n\nThe Barbie pandemonium is most noticeable because the pre-release buzz for the other major, sure-to-be blockbuster being released the same day, Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, throws it into sharp relief.\n\nIt’s not just the color scheme: Barbie’s all neon pinks, in contrast to Oppenheimer’s black-and-white and sepia. It’s not just the stereotypical demographics, if we wanted to be reductive: the female-targeting demo of Barbie versus the cinema bros who thirst for Nolan’s films. It’s that the reaction to the Barbie marketing is so loud in comparison to Oppenheimer that you might forget that the latter film is about the testing of the atomic bomb. (Memes comparing the two films’ PR strategies are delightful and also fascinating looks into how movie fans view the film industry.)\n\nListen, I’m no Ken Doll—for many reasons, including that I’m not delusional enough to ignore that this hoopla is directed tied to capitalist, commercial interests. Barbie is a product owned by a toy company that is expanding its IP into cinema and flooding the field to garner interest in the film. But similar interests controlled the Harry Potter film rollout all those years ago. Two things can be true: the cynical nature of corporatism defining art… and the desire to have fun. Barbie is giving both—and all before any of us has even seen the movie.\n\nKeep obsessing!

I think it’s going to be a movie that evokes conversation when people can get into a fiery debate about something.\n\n\"I think that’s good, I like that… versatility, I guess.”\n\nAustralian actress Robbie, lifted the lid on how Cena landed his cameo role, revealing she may have pulled a few strings after Cena displayed an act of kindness in a London restaurant.\n\n\"It happened while we were filming in London. I ran into him at a restaurant and we’d worked together before,” said Robbie.\n\n“I ran into him because I went to pay the bill and they told me, ‘John Cena already took care of it.’\n\n4 Cena will play the role of a merman in the new Barbie movie Credit: @discussingfilm\n\n4 He looks pretty different from his in-ring persona Credit: Getty\n\n“I was like, ‘what? Where is he because he’s a big guy’.\n\n“I found him and asked him what he was doing here.\n\n“He told me he was shooting [a movie]. He was shooting at Leavesden [studios] where we shot the film as well so I told him, ‘that’s where we’re shooting Barbie. Do you want to come and be a merman in Barbie?’\n\n“He was like, ‘yeah.’\n\n“[I thought] surely he wasn’t just going to agree to it just like that? And he did!\n\n“He’s so awesome like that.”"

But when he posted pictures of the shirt on his Twitter feed, he said, it took off beyond his expectations.\n\n“I normally get about three or four likes on anything I post,” Hudson said. But after sharing a few mock-ups of the shirt, he woke up one morning to hundreds of messages from people asking him if they could buy it.\n\nHudson makes the shirts himself, with a friend, and charges $40. So far he said he had made about 150 shirts, with a second batch of about 70 more on the way. It takes him about 45 minutes to an hour to make one T-shirt, which he does by cutting two shirts in half, pinning them together and sewing and pressing them.\n\n“I had a couple of movie theaters reach out to me privately to do bulk orders for employees,” he said. “It’s been overwhelmingly positive.”"

        "text": "Barbenheimer and Beyond: Hollywood's Greatest Box Office Showdowns\n\nAs the battle of Barbenheimer is decided, we look back on some other classic pairings of films that came out on the same day\n\nImage by Hamza Rasheed\n\nPublished Jul 20, 2023\n\nWhen Warner Bros. Pictures announced the release date for Barbie at CinemaCon in April 2022, eagle-eyed film fans were quick to note that Oppenheimer 's release date, which was announced in late 2021, was scheduled for the same weekend. As July 21, 2023 approached, Barbie's marketing painted cities pink and the internet delighted in sharing memes of the famously introverted Cillian Murphy, Oppenheimer's lead, minding his own business. The diametrically opposed movies offer something for everyone, but their box office battle is more than just a pink explosion for the internet.As pandemic-induced restrictions began to ease, Warner Bros. announced that their entire 2021 slate was going to be released simultaneously in theatres and on HBO Max (as it was then called). In response, Christopher Nolan, one of the studio's most prominent directors, was outspoken in his criticism of the move, describing the decision as making \"no economic sense.\" Although WB was Nolan's home for the better part of 20 years, it was of little surprise that he began shopping his latest film to other studios after their public falling out. It's of even littler surprise that his former employer has decisively pulled out all the stops in their counter-programming strategy.\"Barbenheimer\" isn't the first time two big titles face off at the box office — it isn't even the first time Universal Pictures, Warner Bros. and Nolan have danced this dance. From '80s tentpoles to Christmas fare, we look back at some of the greatest (and most curious) box office showdowns in cinema history.As for Barbie vs. Oppenheimer, who will come out on top is anyone's guess. Nolan's fanbase is ardent and IMAX-happy, but it's hard to discount the fact that Barbie feels like a moment. For my money, it's a peculiarly excellent double feature waiting to happen: come on, Oppy, let's go party.While the box office numbers may seem wildly lopsided, it's important to note that The Shining only released on 10 screens during the Memorial Day weekend compared to The Empire Strikes Back's 126 theatres (the latter also began showing in cinemas two days earlier). Empire would go on to be the top domestic grossing film of 1980 (The Shining was twelfth) and set a new standard for how good sequels could be — but Stanley Kubrick's iconic film, though met with mixed reviews on its initial release, is now considered a bonafide classic in its own right.There are many films that can be considered decade-defining in the '80s, but Ghostbusters and Gremlins represented a shift in the horror genre with the addition of pure comedy; perhaps in keeping with the tubular '80s, viewers looked for the humour in even the most terrifying scenes. However, for some parents, Gremlins took this concept a bit too far, with many not realizing the film was not suitable for children, prompting many to walk out before the film ended that opening weekend. It's rather fitting that two films so emblematic of the decade would be released on the same weekend, with just $1.1 million separating the two.Considering Point Break opened in twice the amount of theatres as Boyz n the Hood, John Singleton's seminal film is the emphatic winner in this SoCal movie competition. Although the two films have a shared location (sort of), Boyz n the Hood's authentic exploration of a much-maligned neighbourhood has cemented it as an American classic, while Point Break continues to delight as a pulpy cop thriller. Neither film toppled Terminator 2: Judgment Day in its second weekend (or earned more than the fourth theatrical re-release of 101 Dalmatians), but they are still beloved by audiences today, albeit for very different reasons.On the surface, it feels like an unfair comparison. The Matrix was one of the biggest cinematic events in the '90s and had an instant impact on pop culture that continues to resonate today. But in 1999, the teen high school comedy really was all the rage. Similar to how I imagine the crowds for Barbie and Oppenheimer will be, The Matrix brought out all the sci-fi boys to the yard, while 10 Things I Hate About You seemed destined to fulfill the angst-ridden high schooler of the day. Both movies have continued to find life beyond their theatrical releases, but one was just on a slightly larger scale than the other.The tale of two Christmases, Elf and Love Actually appeal to different sides of the yuletide from different sides of the pond. Given that Love Actually is a distinctly British film, it's surprising that it was released in the US and Canada two weeks ahead of the UK (where Love Actually topped Elf). Canadian and American audiences were decidedly Team Buddy upon their debuts, but both films have found a place in many households during Christmas. (Fun fact: The Matrix Revolutions was also released on this day and took the top spot at the box office that weekend with $48 million.)Christopher Nolan, Universal Pictures and Warner Bros. were once again behind the ultimate counter-programming move, although the parties were all on different sides than for today's Oppenheimer/Barbie showdown. Nolan and WB were in the midst of their successful partnership, and excitement was exceptionally high for the director's follow-up to 2005's Batman Begins. Universal, in a bid to cut into their competitor's box office receipts, released a rom-com musical, but to no avail. Not only did The Dark Knight crush Mamma Mia! in its opening weekend, it also became the top-grossing film of the year, crossing the $1 billion mark worldwide."

        "text": "Do you hear the term “Barbenheimer” a lot these days? There are times in the ever-changing film business that completely transform the processes of film production, distribution, and reception. July 21, 2023, marked one such milestone, with the emergence of an Internet phenomenon known as “Barbenheimer.” This viral sensation revolved around two films with seemingly opposite genres and themes – “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” – both set to hit theaters simultaneously. As the amalgamation of these titles suggests, the trend captured the attention of millions, showcasing the powerful impact of social media on shaping the film industry’s future.\n\nThe term “Barbenheimer” was coined by online fandoms, who quickly embraced the dual theatrical release of the two movies. Through hashtags, memes, and creative fan-made content, social media became the driving force behind the success of this cinematic experiment. The interplay between die-hard fans, curious cinephiles, and casual moviegoers led to an unprecedented buzz, leading to an influx of bookings across theaters worldwide.\n\nI've been seeing a lot of incredible fan art, mashups and parody posters for what is now known as \"Barbenheimer\". Felt inspired and thought I'd join in on the fun! So here's a little Photoshop fun by me for the DOUBLE FEATURE OF THE CENTURY! 👠💥😎 pic.twitter.com/qUmDkbIMso — Steve Reeves (@stevereevesart) July 11, 2023\n\nAMC Theaters, one of the largest cinema chains, exemplified the tangible influence of social media on this unique event. More than 20,000 of their AMC Stubs members proudly proclaimed their intent to witness both films on the same day. The phenomenon sparked conversations and debates that extended far beyond cinema seats, permeating various online platforms, news outlets, and even academic discussions.\n\nBut what exactly were the implications of Barbenheimer, and how did social media facilitate this groundbreaking marketing success? As industry experts delve into the matter, several key factors come to light. The intertwining of social media and film promotion has proven to be a potent force, capable of not only generating hype but also shaping the narrative surrounding these movies.\n\nThrough interactive campaigns, directors, producers, and studios harnessed the power of user-generated content, turning fans into enthusiastic brand ambassadors. As audiences shared their anticipation, speculations, and personal connections to both Barbie and Oppenheimer, the films acquired a life of their own, transforming into cultural touchstones even before their official release.\n\nAdditionally, the ease of communication on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube facilitated instant feedback loops. Filmmakers could gauge public sentiment and adjust their marketing strategies accordingly, creating a symbiotic relationship with their audience. The barrier between creators and consumers blurred, opening up new possibilities for more inclusive storytelling.\n\nAs we explore the realm of Barbenheimer and social media’s impact on the film industry, this blog post will delve into the underlying mechanisms that made this viral event possible. From the role of online fandoms in shaping modern cinema to the influence of social media in constructing movie identities, we aim to provide an expert analysis of the convergence between art, marketing, and the digital age.\n\nWhat is Barbenheimer?\n\nBarbenheimer is a portmanteau of the words “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” two major summer blockbusters that are set to be released on the same weekend, July 21, 2023. Fans first argued about whether the film was better and which one they would watch, but then wondered, “Why not both?” As a result, the name “Barbenheimer” was coined, and viewers promised to sit through both films in their entirety on the same day. Fans even created a trailer for it!\n\nThe popularity of the fad on the internet has helped make it a marketing success. For instance, AMC Theatres stated that more than 20,000 of its AMC Stubs members had purchased tickets to see both films on the same day. Barbenheimer became so popular that even merchants began to be made about it. When you go to a movie right now, you’re more likely to see one of these than just the Oppenheimer t-shirt.\n\nmy tshirt arrived pic.twitter.com/U5UHZpGfSc — laila 🌿THREE TIME EMMY NOMINEE PEDRO PASCAL (@falconsnat) June 29, 2023\n\nHere are some of the reasons why Barbenheimer is trending:\n\nThe two films are both major blockbusters that are set to be released on the same weekend.\n\nThe films are very different from each other, which has created a lot of anticipation and debate about which film will be more successful.\n\nThe term Barbenheimer is catchy and easy to remember, which has helped it to spread quickly on social media.\n\nThe dating trend that has been dubbed “Barbenheimer” is also generating a lot of buzz.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how Barbenheimer plays out in the coming weeks and months. Will it become a box office success? Will it become a lasting cultural phenomenon? Only time will tell.\n\nActors also love the idea of “Barbenheimer”\n\nActors from both “Oppenheimer” and “Barbie” seem enthusiastic about the idea; in fact, “Barbie” star Margot Robbie has already planned out her ideal “Barbenheimer” weekend.\n\nAt Wednesday’s London premiere of her film, Robbie said, “It’s a perfect double bill.” In my opinion, “I think actually start your day with ‘Barbie,’ then go straight into ‘Oppenheimer’ and then a ‘Barbie’ chaser.”\n\nRyan Gosling, who plays Ken in “Barbie,” agreed, stating he would first watch “Barbie,” then “‘Oppenheimer’ for lunch,” and then “Barbie” again.\n\nCillian Murphy, who plays the protagonist in “Oppenheimer,” told IGN that he “100 percent” intended to see “Barbie” and that Barbenheimer was “just great for the industry and for audiences … you can spend the whole day in the cinema. What’s better than that?”\n\nSocial media’s effect on the film industry and marketing\n\nBarbenheimer is just the latest example of social media’s effect on the film industry and marketing. Social media has revolutionized the film industry and transformed how movies are marketed and experienced. Here are some key ways in which social media has had a profound effect on the film industry and its marketing strategies:\n\nAudience engagement and interaction: Social media platforms provide an unprecedented opportunity for filmmakers and studios to engage directly with their audience. Through official accounts, hashtags, and live Q&A sessions, filmmakers can interact with fans, respond to questions, and build a sense of community. This engagement fosters a deeper emotional connection between the audience and the film, driving anticipation and word-of-mouth marketing.\n\nSocial media platforms provide an unprecedented opportunity for filmmakers and studios to engage directly with their audience.

Studios recognize the value of these fan-driven initiatives, often incorporating fan-generated content into official marketing campaigns to amplify the movie’s reach.\n\nSocial media thrives on viral content, and films with dedicated fan bases can leverage this phenomenon to their advantage.

Extended storytelling and transmedia campaigns: Social media allows filmmakers to extend storytelling beyond the confines of the movie screen. They can create transmedia campaigns that incorporate interactive elements, alternate reality games, and online puzzles, enriching the movie’s universe and keeping audiences engaged long after the film’s release. This approach transforms the film into a multi-platform experience, enticing fans to explore the narrative across different media channels.\n\nSocial media allows filmmakers to extend storytelling beyond the confines of the movie screen.

It also facilitates discussions and reactions across diverse cultures, giving rise to a broader exchange of ideas and perspectives. Crowdsourced marketing and user-generated content: Audiences have become active participants in film marketing through user-generated content (UGC). Fans create memes, trailers, and promotional videos, sharing them across social media platforms, effectively becoming co-creators of the movie’s marketing campaign. This organic sharing enhances the film’s visibility, authenticity, and credibility.\n\nHow AI and big data analytics are changing influencer marketing\n\nIn conclusion, social media’s effect on the film industry and marketing has been transformative. It has empowered audiences, broken down barriers between filmmakers and fans, and opened up new avenues for creativity and engagement. As social media platforms continue to evolve, the film industry must adapt and harness the power of these digital tools to stay connected with audiences and drive success in an ever-competitive landscape.\n\nFeatured image credit: DiscussingFilm"

One film, after all, is about a plastic doll and her boyfriend. The other is about Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who helped the United States develop the first nuclear bomb and changed the course of the Second World War.\n\nGiven the enduring popularity of Barbie, it's maybe no great surprise that her first outing on the big screen is expected to emerge triumphant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's predicted to gross between $70 million and $80 million on its first three days in US theaters, according to internal projections from Warner Bros. seen by The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThat's as much as double the $40 million that Universal Pictures expects \"Oppenheimer\" to take in the same period, per the report. (Part of the discrepancy may be length: \"Oppenheimer\" runs for three hours, which means theaters can't squeeze in as many screenings of it as they can of \"Barbie,\" which comes in at a touch under two hours.)\n\nCillian Murphy plays the nuclear physicist in \"Oppenheimer.\" Eamonn McCormack/Getty Images\n\nWhile both movies cost about $100 million to make, the marketing hype for \"Barbie\" continues to amaze many observers. There's even a full-scale replica of Barbie's Malibu Dream house listed on Airbnb.\n\nNo matter who wins, the feud may be less contentious than audiences have been led to believe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCritics point out that the competing releases are a top-notch example of \"counter-programming\" by both studios – a reference to simultaneously releasing titles that'll appeal to very different audiences.\n\nThe biggest audience for Gerwig's film, which stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, is likely to be women under 35, per The Hollywood Reporter. The trade publication points out that it's the same demographic that helped turn the \"Mamma Mia\" and \"Sex and the City\" movies into box-office monsters.\n\nNolan, meanwhile, will be hoping that his latest feature, which boasts an A-list cast, erases memories of \"Tenet,\" which bombed after being released in theaters (at his insistence) at the height of the pandemic in 2020.\n\nOf course, as Ryan Gilbey notes for The Guardian, \"there will be some overlap between their audiences.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if you are planning on catching them on the same day, my Insider colleagues Rebecca Cohen and Chris Panella have come up with the perfect schedule for a Barbenheimer double bill, no matter which you see first.\n\nAs they point out: \"While 'Barbie' calls for fruity cocktails and clubbing with the girls, 'Oppenheimer' gives off more of a black coffee and cigarette energy.\"\n\nWhichever film takes the weekend, it's unlikely that either one will beat out \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie,\" which had the best debut of the year. The Nintendo flick is also the highest-grossing film of 2023, making more than $1.3 billion globally.\n\n\"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\" and \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" both made it into nine figures on their opening weekends, taking $120 million and $118 million respectively, according to Comscore figures reported by Variety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOverall it's been a much better year for theaters, with US ticket sales sitting just over $4.3 billion at the six-month mark – up by 20% over 2022, per Comscore.\n\nThat's before the release of more blockbusters, including \"Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One\" and, of course, \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer.\"\n\nAnd no matter what happens on July 21, one thing is certain: As David Gross, who writes a box office newsletter, told The New York Times: \"Audiences are going to find them, and both films are going to do extremely well.\""

Robert Oppenheimer) and Greta Gerwig's movie \"Barbie\" (about the Mattel doll) are both being released on the same day has delighted fans. People are creating schedules for back-to-back viewings. There are plans for what to eat and drink. There are even plans on what to wear.\n\nAnd then there are the memes.\n\nIn an interview with BBC Radio 1 on July 18, Margot Robbie, who stars as Barbie in the titular movie, and Ryan Gosling, who plays Ken, shared their thoughts on the \"Barbenheimer\" memes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked if she had seen the memes, Robbie said that her friends have been sending her a lot of them. \"People are so clever, people who come up with those funny memes,\" she said.\n\nAt the end of the interview, Gosling managed to create a new meme all by himself when he asked, \"What is a meme?\"\n\nTwitter users were quick to pick up on Gosling's reference to \"Oppenheimer\" actor Cillian Murphy, who once asked the same question in an interview with NME.\n\n\"He knew exactly what he was doing there,\" tweeted one user.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Ali showing once again why he's the best at this. Congrats on the birth of a new meme,\" tweeted another.\n\nMeanwhile, Twitter users were creating memes of their own.\n\n\"I feel like this is the Grimace Shake, but for #Barbenheimer. I obviously loved it,\" one user tweeted, referring to the recent viral McDonald's Grimace Shake trend.\n\n\"I love that fans are taking the oppenheimer press into their own hands,\" read another tweet referencing ths smoking pink Barbie house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTikTok users are also creating videos to celebrate the release. The #Barbenheimer hashtag currently has 109 million views.\n\nOne user, who goes by the username @alysilverio, shared a video of a Barbie-themed party she'd thrown. The caption read, \"pov: you throw a barbie themed party and the boys show up like this.\"\n\nIn the video, the men walk through the door wearing flat caps and waistcoats, presumably representing characters from \"Oppenheimer.\" They are greeted by a group of women dressed entirely in pink.\n\nOne of the women is holding a Barbie-themed cake, which the TikTok creator made in a previous TikTok video.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You mean peaky blinders?\" the top comment read.\n\nAnother comment read, \"Wow, that's so Ken of them actually.\"\n\nIn another video that has 3.5 million views, Tess Donatello, who goes by the TikTok username @tessdonatello, showed herself taking off her black \"Oppenheimer\"-themed outfit, to reveal her pink Barbie-themed outfit underneath.\n\n\"BYE THIS ATE,\" read the top comment, which has 59,700 likes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWarner Bros. predicts that \"Barbie\" will take up to $80 million in its first three days — about double the $40 million that Universal Pictures expects \"Oppenheimer\" to take in the same period.\n\nSources told Insider's Jason Guerrasio that \"Oppenheimer\" writer and director Christopher Nolan wasn't thrilled the studio wanted to release \"Barbie\" the same weekend as \"Oppenheimer.\"\n\nIn a recent interview with Guerrasio about whether \"Barbenheimer\" is \"strictly pettiness\" by Warner Bros, Nolan said, \"Now, you must know I'm not going to answer that question, only to say those who care about the theatrical experience, we've been longing for a crowded marketplace with a lot of different movies. That's what theaters have now, and those of us who care about movies are thrilled about that.\"\n\nThere's still time for even more memes and videos to surface before both movies are released on July 21. The fun has just begun."

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMillions of people are buzzing to see \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" this weekend — a cinematic showdown and pop-culture phenomenon dubbed \"Barbenheimer\" by some. Warren Buffett has nodded to both the iconic doll and the father of the atomic bomb over the years.\n\nThe famed investor debuted a set of four exclusive Barbies during Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in 2000. The dolls were cobranded with See's Candies, the Berkshire-owned confectioner that Buffett has hailed as his dream business.\n\nA glamorous blonde assistant in a See's Candies uniform brought two of the dolls to the stage where Buffett and his business partner, Charlie Munger, were seated. She pecked Munger on the cheek, prompting Buffett to quip, \"It's just a sample of what it's like to be an officer at Berkshire.\"\n\n\"This is the new See's Barbie doll,\" Buffett declared. \"And believe it or not, we've come up with three more just like this young woman.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We wanted our shareholders to be the first ones to have a shot at this new product,\" the Berkshire CEO continued, adding cheekily, \"The model is not included.\"\n\nThe lighthearted moment can be watched in full on CNBC's Warren Buffett Archive.\n\nOn a far more serious note, Buffett has frequently touched on J. Robert Oppenheimer's signature creation, the atomic bomb. He's repeatedly underscored the immense threat that nuclear weapons pose to the world.\n\n\"I've been concerned since 1945 when the first atomic bomb was used,\" Buffett said in 2017. \"We have developed over these 72 years, since August of 1945, the ability around the world to almost destroy civilization.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In 1945, we unleashed something like the world had never seen, and that is a pop gun compared to what can be done now,\" he noted during Berkshire's yearly gathering in 2016.\n\nBuffett also called nuclear weapons \"the ultimate problem of mankind\" in 2006. Moreover, the billionaire said in 2016 that if he could reduce the risk of a major nuclear, chemical, biological, or cyber attack by even 5%, he would commit all his wealth toward achieving that goal.\n\nThe Berkshire chief has also asserted that a US president's top priority should be combating those threats, and warned a major nuclear attack is one of the few things that could bankrupt his company.\n\nBuffett hasn't said whether he's going to see \"Barbie\" or \"Oppenheimer\" this weekend. Given he's drummed up demand for special-edition dolls, and banged the drum on nuclear threats, neither option seems out of the question."

However, there is massive excitement among Indian viewers for Barbenheimer, both releasing on July 21.\n\nAdvance bookings for the opening day in the top three national chains alone exceeded all predictions, with around three lakh tickets sold for both movies combined, Pinkvilla reported.\n\nFor the opening day, Oppenheimer has managed to sell over two lakh tickets while Barbie followed closely behind with over 80 thousand tickets sold in the top three national chains, as per the publication. These numbers indicate a combined box office collection of anywhere between ₹15 to 20 crores nett, primarily driven by audiences in metro cities, Pinkvilla added.\n\nRenowned screenwriter Paul Schrader earlier expressed his admiration for Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, likening it to his own iconic works such as \"Taxi Driver\" and \"Raging Bull.\" Calling it the \"most important film of this century,\" Schrader encouraged viewers to experience Oppenheimer's brilliance on the big screen.\n\nAcross the Pacific, Greta Gerwig's Barbie is projected to surpass Oppenheimer in the US box office race, boasting a star-studded cast featuring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. The film is expected to make a dazzling $110 million debut, with industry analysts even predicting it could reach as high as $140 million. Warner Bros, the distributor of \"Barbie,\" remains more cautious, anticipating a $75 million opening in the US market.\n\nInterestingly, while Barbie is dominating the US box office, Oppenheimer's appeal in India is soaring, probably due to Christopher Nolan's esteemed reputation as one of the finest filmmakers of his generation. At the same time, many have termed Oppenheimer as Nolan’s best work till date.\n\nBarbie, on the other hand, comes from a director who has made outstanding films like Lady Bird and Little Women. In a wrapper of childlike presentation, she is delivering something that is more mature than it seems.\n\nMilestone Alert!Livemint tops charts as the fastest growing news website in the world 🌏 Click here to know more."

De memes begonnen toen duidelijk werd dat twee van de grote zomerfilms dit jaar – Greta Gerwigs Barbie en Christopher Nolans Oppenheimer – in Amerika op dezelfde dag (vrijdag 21 juli) zouden worden uitgebracht. In Nederland worden ze overigens al iets eerder uitgebracht (Barbie op woensdag 19 juli, Oppenheimer een dag later), maar daar had het internet uiteraard geen boodschap aan.\n\nDe grap van Barbenheimer is dat de twee films onderling niet meer van elkaar zouden kunnen verschillen. Barbie is een in roze gedrenkte genderkomedie over de iconische, blonde en langbenige meidenpop van Mattel; Oppenheimer een sombere, serieuze karakterstudie over J. Robert Oppenheimer, de ‘vader van de atoombom’.\n\nOnline verschenen zelfgemaakte trailers voor Barbenheimer, er kwamen polls voor welke films je bij deze double-bill als eerste moest bekijken, en influencers gingen de straat op om aan mensen te vragen naar welke van deze twee films ze meer uitkeken. Kortom: de hypemachine draaide op volle toeren voor twee films die eigenlijk niets met elkaar te maken hebben."

        "text": "Check out the brain on Barbie! Sure, she’s just a doll, but that doesn’t mean she has to be an airhead. Therein lies “Lady Bird” director Greta Gerwig’s inspired, 21st-century solution to bringing one of America’s most iconic playthings to life on the big screen. Combine that with the casting of Margot Robbie in the title role, and “Barbie” is already starting out on the right, perfectly arched foot. So what if this high-concept comedy falls a bit flat in the final stretch?\n\nBarbie’s strength as a brand comes from her aspirational appeal. While some have rightly criticized the doll for setting unrealistic beauty standards, Barbie also showed girls they can do and be anything, as different models have portrayed her as president, a rocket scientist, even trans. You know who else sets unrealistic beauty standards? Movie stars. Like Barbie, they serve as role models, which is what makes Gerwig’s take on the ultra-popular toy line so darn smart. Robbie might be a dead-ringer for Barbie, but her moxie powers the performance. Gerwig has made the kind of family film she surely wishes had been available to her when she was a girl, sneaking a message (several of them, really) inside Barbie’s hollow hourglass figure.\n\nThat’s an admirable achievement, given understandably protective corporate parent Mattel — though let’s be honest, in the year 2023, it would be a shock (and box office suicide) if “Barbie” arrived without some kind of female-empowerment message baked in. This one checks all the right boxes, while making Ryan Gosling’s dumb-dumb Ken the butt of most of its gender-equity jokes. Boasting fresh tracks from Billie Eilish and Lizzo, the result is a very funny kids’ movie with a freshman liberal arts student’s vocabulary that tosses around terms like “patriarchy” and “appropriation” — pretty much everything but “problematic,” which the movie implies without actually calling Barbie’s legacy.\n\nThat’s the front on which Gerwig and Noah Baumbach’s script feels most daring. “Barbie” doesn’t just poke fun at Mattel; it comes right out and accuses the bestselling doll of setting back the women’s movement. As one indignant teen tells Barbie: “You’ve been making women feel bad about themselves since you were invented.” This reproach stuns Robbie’s upbeat character, who wakes up every day in the always sunny, hot pink fantasy world where Barbies come in all colors and body types. They win Nobel Prizes and occupy all 12 seats on the Supreme Court. And they’re occasionally pestered by dozens of Ken dolls, who are clearly insecure about being sold (and kept) separately.\n\nBarbie Land, as it’s called, is an inherently hilarious alternate reality modeled on the dream that Mattel has been selling American girls since the doll was introduced in 1959. It looks a lot like the one they’ve seen in countless commercials, where flamingo-bright Barbie Dreamhouses inspire envy as a diverse collection of perky, positive-minded dolls smile and wave at one another (represented here by such avatars as Alexandra Shipp and Dua Lipa, Issa Rae and Ritu Aryu, Hari Nef and Sharon Rooney). It’s a wild pop-art space, all but exploding with supersaturated color, where the doll heads appear lower contrast and backlit, obliging us to squint to make out the actors’ faces.\n\nYou half-expect to see a giant hand reach in from the sky to interact with these lifelike toys, but that’s not how it works. Instead, Gerwig enlists Helen Mirren as narrator to lay out the rules, pausing now and then to spotlight specific costumes, interject vintage TV spots or cast shade on discontinued products — such as Growing Up Skipper, with her inflatable bust; pregnant Midge; or questionable-taste offerings like Sugar Daddy and Tanner, a flocked dog that poops plastic pellets.\n\nAlthough Robbie’s blond-haired, fair-skinned Stereotypical Barbie seems to possess some abstract notion of herself as a toy, there’s a major disconnect between inventor Ruth Handler’s best intentions and the state of things in the Real World (where the movie spends roughly half its time): “Thanks to Barbie, all problems of feminism and equal rights have been solved,” Mirren sarcastically summarizes. One evening, in the middle of a dance party, Stereotypical Barbie blurts out, “You guys ever think about dying?” The next morning, she’s horrified to find her feet have flattened and a patch of cellulite has appeared. What could be threatening her near-perfect physique?\n\nThe answer lies in the Real World, where Barbie and Ken (Gosling’s Ken, not the ones played by Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, John Cena and others) steer her pink Corvette, emerging at Venice Beach wearing matching fluorescent Hot Skatin’ ensembles. Yes, “Barbie” is one of those movies, like “The Smurfs” and “The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” where imaginary characters cross over to modern-day America — just infinitely more clever. Instead of using the premise as a setup for slapstick, Gerwig shows Barbie defending herself when some random guy slaps her butt, getting a knuckle sandwich in return.\n\nThe script is no less on-the-nose about its politics, and in any case, Gerwig and Baumbach’s social critiques seem more than reasonable. Their script merely emphasizes how lopsided the Real World remains in its treatment of women, up to and including Mattel’s corporate headquarters, where a working mom named Gloria (America Ferrara) holds an entry-level job, while the boardroom is packed entirely with guys in suits. At the head of the table sits Will Ferrell in what is easily the film’s laziest casting choice. (Hasn’t he played a dozen versions of this character before, most obviously starring as Lord Business in “The Lego Movie”?) Defaulting to Ferrell means passing up the chance to create a memorable original embodiment of the kind of men who run corporate America.\n\nAt the same time Barbie is experiencing her rude awakening, Ken’s busy filling his empty head with all the possibilities that “patriarchy” entails. In Barbie Land, Ken’s job is a deliberately ill-defined afterthought (basically, just “beach”), whereas in the Real World, dudes rule — an idea he takes back to Barbie Land with pointedly absurd results, brainwashing all the women into behaving like obedient housewives. The film’s draggier second half gets both silly and unabashedly strident, as Stereotypical Barbie seeks help from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a damaged-goods doll with singed hair and messed-up makeup who serves as this girly-girl world’s Morpheus-like sage.\n\nIt’s upsetting (in a useful way) to see Barbie confronted with the overnight impact of rampant patriarchy, a concept that has rarely looked more off-putting than the frat-boy fantasy caricatured here. Think of it as the misogynist alternative marketed by old-school beer commercials, the polar opposite of Mattel’s mid-’80s “We girls can do anything. Right, Barbie?” campaign. While the Barbies plot to take back the government, Gerwig gives all the Ken dolls an over-the-top musical number, “I’m Just Ken,” which is so amusingly self-involved it risks subverting the very point the movie’s trying to make. If “Barbie” is all about centering and celebrating women, why let Ken steal the show?\n\nGosling is a good sport to play the slightly predatory, sartorially helpless pretty boy, as the spray-tanned ex-Mouseketeer parodies his popular “hey girl” persona, flexing both his muscles and a range of facial expressions all but lacking from his recent work. If Robbie’s Barbie sets an impossibly high bar for young women, then Gosling’s Ken reps an equally formidable male model, with his chiseled abs and cheekbones.\n\nThat factor hasn’t escaped Gerwig, who sets out to disrupt such unattainable aesthetic standards, calling out ways the doll’s idealized design can harm self-esteem and encourage eating disorders. She crams most of that critique into a single motormouthed monologue, which drew cheers at the premiere and which, on closer inspection, contains not a single controversial idea. In the end, the trouble with “Barbie” isn’t that it goes too far, but that it stops short, building to a conceptual scene between Barbie and her Creator (Rhea Perlman) that inadvertently underscores one of the movie’s few failings: It’s an intellectual experience, not an emotional one, grounded largely in audience nostalgia.\n\nThe power of nostalgia ought not be underestimated with a property like this, as much of Gerwig’s approach skews toward grown women and gay audiences who’ve owned the dolls — and for whom she’s embedded deep-cut trivia and hidden references throughout. The movie was clearly made by people who understand how kids’ imaginations work when playing with Barbies, even if Gerwig uses the project as the delivery device for what sounds like an undergraduate gender studies lecture at times. Most of its points are positive ones for young girls to hear, while those that earned the film its PG-13 rating will fly right over their heads as they feast on all the eye candy, including re-creations of classic looks by Jacqueline Durran (costumes) and Sarah Greenwood (production design).\n\nIt’s kind of perfect that “Barbie” is opening opposite Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer,” since Gerwig’s girl-power blockbuster offers a neon-pink form of inception all its own, planting positive examples of female potential for future generations. Meanwhile, by showing a sense of humor about the brand’s past stumbles, it gives us permission to challenge what Barbie represents — not at all what you’d expect from a feature-length toy commercial."

        "text": "As reviews for “Barbie” rolled out ahead of its weekend opening, a critical divide emerged.\n\nSome thought that Greta Gerwig, the acclaimed director of “Lady Bird” and “Little Women,” had met the expectations for a more subversive take on the 11.5-inch Mattel phenomenon. They thought Gerwig’s script, which she collaborated on with her partner, Noah Baumbach, succeeded in acknowledging the criticisms that the Barbie brand has received over the years — including unrealistic representations of women’s bodies and, up until recent years, a lack of diversity in its collection — while presenting a comedy that leans into the delightful weirdness of the Barbie universe. Others felt that the director did not go far enough in dinging her corporate sponsors, keeping the critiques of consumerism and female beauty standards at surface level.\n\nCritics tended to be unified in their praise of the movie’s stars, however, celebrating Margot Robbie’s surprising emotional depth as the so-called stereotypical Barbie who embarks on an eye-opening journey outside of the meticulously manufactured dolls’ world, as well as Ryan Gosling’s deadpan comedy as a Ken who delights in his discovery of the patriarchy.\n\nRead on for some highlights.\n\n‘Barbie’ May Be the Most Subversive Blockbuster of the 21st Century [Rolling Stone]\n\nThe movie does more than avoid delivering a two-hour commercial for Mattel, David Fear writes, suggesting that the movie could be “the most subversive blockbuster of the 21st century to date.”"

        "text": "“I feel like I need to correct the record a little bit,” Margot Robbie tells Rolling Stone.\n\nEarlier this year, the actress revealed to the world that she had a bit of a “goth phase” and loved heavy metal when she was younger. But it was just one of many formative musical obsessions that shaped the Barbie star during her youth.\n\n“I had my death-metal phase — and I do still like that — but I also like a lot of music,” she continues.\n\nWhen Robbie was five, she became particularly obsessed with the Beach Boys thanks to a tape her family had. It was “all [she] would listen to.” She was so devoted to the group that she even refused to listen to the Beatles.\n\n“I had watched a documentary about how the Beach Boys would have been even more popular if the Beatles hadn’t come along and stolen the limelight,” she explains. The band had ties to Barbie’s world just a few years before Robbie was born, with Brian Wilson having penned a tune called “Living Doll (Barbie)” for the California Dream Barbie in 1987. Earlier this year, the Beach Boys’ “Fun, Fun, Fun” was featured in the Barbie trailer.\n\nAs a Nineties kid, Robbie also had a strong love for the pop music of that era. She begged Barbie director and co-writer Greta Gerwig to include the bubbly Aqua hit “Barbie Girl” in the film in some capacity. She also loved the Spice Girls, an impossible-to-avoid musical phenomenon for any young girl during that time.\n\n“The Spice Girls changed everything and dictated my version of second-wave feminism,” Robbie says. “It’s like, ‘Oh, my God, they wear little sparkly dresses and push-up bras, and then have a girl gang? That’s what I want to be!’” (The Spice Girls inspired their own line of Barbie-like dolls, though those weren’t official Barbie/Mattel toys.)\n\nRobbie entered her metal and emo era when she was a teenager, and though it didn’t last forever, it still helped shape her eclectic taste. That taste has bled into her prolific acting career, as she often makes playlists for the characters she inhabits before stepping foot into their worlds.

        "text": "Life in plastic is fantastic, thanks in part to the hefty check Margot Robbie received for her role in Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie.”\n\nThe Australian bombshell made $12.5 million for the Mattel film, according to a report from Variety, making her one of the highest-paid actresses of 2022.\n\nIn “Barbie as The Island Princess,” the OG tippy toes, tits up blonde imparts some unexpected poetry, “Life is a sea I’m sailing, riding the winds of time. Looking to find a course that is mine. Striving to find direction. Starting to understand, every wave’s a part of the plan.”\n\nRobbie is a moon child that’s well versed in course setting, wind riding and sailing high on the waves of change. A girl who grew up building forts in her back yard and cut her teeth making Subway sandwiches in Melbourne, the two-time Academy Award-nominated actor made her star turn as Naomi Lapaglia, the mistress turned MILF of the century in Martin Scorsese “The Wolf of Wall Street.”\n\nMargot has since lent her prodigious talents to roles as far ranging as an unhinged comic book character, a vengeful figure skater, a silent film star, Sharon Tate and Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nThis summer, Robbie takes to the screen, drenched in pink and packed with moxie to play the titular role of “Barbie.” She stars opposite Ryan Gosling as Ken in Gerwig’s live action imagining of the life, times and sudden conscious awakening of the iconic doll. How did the divine design of Robbie’s birth chart prepare her for the role of a lifetime?\n\nWhy doesn’t Margot vibe with her sun sign?\n\n5 Margot Robbie’s sun is in the twelfth house of shadows and sabotage. Getty Images\n\nBorn July 2, 1990 at 7:45 AM down under time Robbie is a quintuple Cancer with a Scorpio moon and a heavy dose of planets in grind or die, if you build it they will pay, Capricorn. Robbie has some telling thoughts on her birth chart.\n\nShe revealed to “W,” magazine, “I’m a Cancer. But I don’t really identify as a Cancer…Everything I’ve ever heard about Cancers doesn’t sound like me: that they’re very sensitive, wear their emotions on their sleeve, and are real homebodies. I hate being at home, I’m not particularly sensitive, and I don’t really wear my emotions on my sleeve.”\n\nHow is it that a person with a FIVE PLACEMENT STELLIUM IN CANCER, including her ascendant, not feel like a Cancer? Because my dudes all of that cardinal water is pooling in Robbie’s twelfth house of shadows, hidden matters, self-undoing and the unconscious mind and planets present in this house are not obvious to, or celebrated by the person in question.\n\nThe twelfth house is the domain of secrets, shame and other such things we are reluctant to show. Here, everything is shrouded, dimmed or buried. Thus, despite the heavy concentration of Cancer in her chart, the Cancer archetype and its stereotypes of a super sensitive, bleeding heart homebody don’t resonate with Robbie.\n\nCounter to Cancer\n\n5 Margot Robbie wearing silver, the power color for her zodiac sign. Getty Images for Paramount Pictu\n\nIn terms of presentation, Cancer is ruled by the moon and true to her rising sign, Robbie’s visage is luminous AF, looking as she does like an abalone bowl of holy water mixed with the resplendent dust of Cinderella’s pulverized lost slipper.\n\nMany astrologers hold fast to the theory that as we age, we raise ourselves (or rise up) into our respective rising signs. In this sense, Robbie may begin to identify with her Cancer placements if and when she decides to become a mother.\n\nInterestingly, Robbie’s husband is a Capricorn sun and while the two have yet to add children to their family, the ‘build it’ influence of their shared cardinal earth energy finds a home in LuckyChap Entertainment, the couple’s join production company which in addition to producing “Barbie,” has brought “I, Tonya,” and “Promising Young Woman,” to the screen as well as the Hulu series “Dollface” and the Netflix miniseries “Maid” to streaming services.\n\nRestriction and reward\n\n5 Margot Robbie’s husband Thomas Ackerley is a Capricorn. Getty Images for Paramount Pictu\n\nTrue to her ascendant Robbie’s visage is luminous AF, looking as she does like an abalone bowl full of holy water mixed with the resplendent dust of Cinderella’s pulverized lost slipper.\n\nAnother feature of Robbie’s birth chart that supports her struggle to identify with her Cancer placements is the presence of dad jeans planet Saturn directly opposing her rising sign.\n\nSaturn is known as a malefic planet and in Capricorn, the sign of its rulership, it’s super charged and downright overpowering. Saturn constricts and limits what it touches and in the case of Robbie’s ascendant, this equates to a suppression of the stereotypical expression of the Cancer archetype.\n\nThis could be why Robbie resists sitting still and staying home and is by her own admission, a distracted, disastrous cook. Robbie’s ascendant is also weakened by the square aspect it forms to Mars, planet of drive and desire, in its home team sign of Aries.\n\nThis planetary placement is legitimately setting setting a match to the moody waters of Cancer and is likely to blame for Robbie’s habit of setting her kitchen and her holiday hams on fire.\n\nScorpio at heart\n\n5 Margot Robbie’s chart is heavily weighted towards water. John Phillips/Getty Images\n\nRobbie’s moon is in the secret holding, power hoarding sign of Scorpio and as a Cancer rising the moon is her chart ruler. Scorpio is at once deeply emotional and fanatically private, they absolutely do not wear their emotions on their sleeves, preferring instead to hate whisper them into a tattered spider’s web and bury them in a root cellar.\n\nThere’s a real obsessive/possessive element to the Scorpio archetype, particularly for moon placements and it seems Robbie has channeled these twin tendencies in her approach to securing and performing roles, as she told “Babylon” director Damien Chazelle, “I have to play this character—she’s mine.”\n\nFurther, Robbie expressed something like grief, the provenance of Plutonian Scorpio, when she described the process of letting go of that role,” “I’m sad finishing every job. I always get attached to everyone in the film, and I sometimes get attached to certain characters.I think I poured so much of myself and my body and everything into this character that it kind of left me in pieces at the end of it. I didn’t want it to end.”\n\nNew York Post readers also love:\n\nBorn for Barbie\n\n5 Margot Robbie gives life to the plastic icon in “Barbie.” ©Warner Bros\n\nScorpio is at once deeply emotional and fanatically private, they absolutely do not wear their emotions on their sleeves, preferring instead to hate whisper them into a tattered spider’s web and bury them in a root cellar.\n\nIn terms of sun/moon combinations Cancer is about root systems and Scorpio is about shedding skin, burning boats and breaking ground to make way for what is yet to be; nostalgia and newness in an underwater tea party conversation. We see these two energies at work in Robbie’s turn as Barbie, an iconoclastic reimagining of the doll who is loved and loathed in equal measure.\n\nRobbie’s Barbie stays true to some of her traditions; mainly a banging wardrobe and a perennial effervescence while moving into a a more self-aware modern, Feminist modality. To be fair, there was a bit of female subversion from the midcentury jump; in a bold, beautiful inversion of the creation myth, Barbie came first and out of demand, in second place and in her plastic image, came Ken.\n\nRobbie’s Barbie role is further supported by her Mars in Aries/Venus in Gemini. Mars is our planet of action and Venus the ruler of attraction, attachment and aesthetics. Mars in Aries lives for a challenge and in cahoots with a Scorpio moon is absolutely relentless in its pursuit of desire. Venus in Gemini craves constant intrigue and changing scenery. Apropos of this, Robbie told “Vogue,” “All I want to do is live on a train,” a perfect scenario for a Mars/Venus combo that is allergic to boredom and seeks always to be intellectually stimulated, physically on the move and ever on the make.\n\nOther casual indicators of Robbie Venus/Mars tango include our girl removing the brakes from her recreational roller skates and going off script to slap Leonardo DiCaprio during her “Wolf of Wall Street” audition. That’s air helping fire burn bright my babies, the quick instincts of Gemini and the fearlessness of Aries mixed with the psychic sway of Scorpio and the under the moody, moon drop shine of Cancer.\n\nAstrology 101: Your guide to the star\n\nAstrologer Reda Wigle researches and irreverently reports back on planetary configurations and their effect on each zodiac sign.

But how did he land that once-in-a-lifetime role?\n\nMARGOT ROBBIE ON HOW RYAN LANDED THE PART OF KEN\n\nGosling's co-star Margot Robbie, who plays the titular role in the film, recently revealed how Ryan's version of Ken came about.\n\nSpeaking to AP Entertainment, Margot recalled seeing Gosling breaking up a fight on the street many years ago.\n\nadvertisement\n\nREAD | 'Barbie': Cast, plot and more. Everything to know about the Greta Gerwig film\n\nSpeaking to both the journalist as well as her co-star, Margot said, \"You (Ryan Gosling) are not on set or anything. You intervene when two people are about to fight, and you come in like a hero, like a humble hero, and kind of save the day and that went wild on the internet. That viral video and the hammer pants gave me that confirmation.\"\n\nFor the unversed, Margot has co-produced the Barbie movie. She added, \"I saw that video and thought he must be a great guy. And Ken needs to be played by a good guy because you are gonna be directed by a female director and some movie stars might not be cool with that. You must be secure in your masculinity to go on the Barbie ride the way Ryan did.\"\n\nALSO SEE | Katrina as Barbie, Ranveer as Ken.

Back in May, Cena described his casting as a \"happy accident,\" explaining that he and Robbie had a chance encounter that led to Robbie offering him a role in the upcoming \"Barbie\" movie. As Cena previously explained, he was in the midst of filming \"Fast X\" at the time, which was, coincidentally, across the street from where the \"Barbie\" production was set.\n\nOn \"Insight with Chris Van Vliet,\" Robbie, who stars as the title character and is also a producer on \"Barbie,\" provided more context on her aforementioned interaction with Cena.\n\n\"It happened while we were shooting in London,\" Robbie said. \"I ran into him at a restaurant and we'd worked together before. Actually, I ran into him because I went to pay the bill and they were like, 'John Cena already took care of it' and I was like, 'What? Where is he?' I mean he's a big guy, but I was like, 'He's hard to hide.'\""

At this point, the two-time Oscar nominee is basically Barbie. But what if we told you she wasn’t? Robbie and the cast of the film took a personality quiz to see which Barbie character they’re most like in real life, and Robbie’s reaction to her result was totally priceless.\n\nWhile chatting with Buzzfeed, Robbie, Kate McKinnon, America Ferrera, and Michael Cera scrolled through a series of oddly specific questions and prompts to identify which character they are from the movie. Parts of the quiz asked, “What’s a quality you look for in a friend?” while others cued the cast to “Pick a color to paint your dreamhouse.” Everyone’s answers were, as you can see in the video below, fairly different. Then it was time for the big reveal.\n\n“I can’t believe my results,” Robbie said to her cast mates. “I’m Ken!” Robbie’s voice did have a tinge of disappoint to it. “This is how I felt when I did the Pottermore quiz to see which house I’d be in,” Robbie, a noted Hufflepuff, continued. Even after reading the description of the affable character, Robbie rejected her result that she is Ken, saying, “No, I’m not!”\n\nSlamming her phone face down on the Barbiecore pink sofa, Robbie pondered what response could have possibly given her Ken. Ultimately, though, we know Robbie is Barbie. Maybe the quiz just goes to show each of us has Kenergy within us all. Embrace the Kenergy, Margot! You are Kenough just the way you are!\n\nBefore you go, click here to see the best Barbiecore looks on the red carpet:\n\n"

        "text": "Margot Robbie is an Australian actor hailed as one of the biggest names in Hollywood. She owes her success to the brilliant characters she portrays in movies, which majorly contribute to her high net worth.\n\nRobbie was born in Dalby, Queensland, and started her acting career in Australia before moving to the US sometime in the early 2010s.\n\nIn just a decade, she has cemented her name as one of the most bankable stars in the industry. Her outstanding performances in films, such as I, Tonya (2017) and Bombshell (2019), and big-budget franchise movies of DC Extended Universe (DCEU) have turned Robbie into an instantly recognisable worldwide name from Japan to the American west coast.\n\nShe has also successfully added the tag of producer to her name as well as that of a businessperson, partnering with her husband, British filmmaker Tom Ackerley, on several acclaimed movies.\n\nInterestingly, Robbie is known for being an extremely private person. She is not on social media, having apparently deactivated her Instagram account sometime after announcing a break from social platforms in 2021. Her Facebook account has only a handful of posts, and most of them are related to her films, with the last post being from March 2018.\n\nMargot Robbie: A look at her career\n\nMargot Robbie started her acting career with the Australian TV series Neighbours (2008–2011, 2022). Her breakthrough role came with The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), and she has since gone on to lead major critically and commercially successful films, such as Z for Zachariah (2015), I, Tonya, Mary Queen of Scots (2018), Bombshell, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019) and Asteroid City (2023).\n\nHer portrayal of Harley Quinn in three DCEU films — Suicide Squad (2016), Birds of Prey (2020) and The Suicide Squad (2021) — has been hailed universally by fans of the iconic DC comic book character.\n\nShe has garnered two Academy Award nominations, four Golden Globe nominations and five BAFTA nominations so far. She has also been recognised by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2017.\n\nHow much does Margot Robbie earn from films?\n\nCelebrity wealth tracker Celebrity Net Worth estimates Margot Robbie may have a net worth of USD 40 million.\n\nMuch of this is obviously because of her film career. But it is not clear how much she may have made from the movies she has been a part of as an actor or producer in the earlier years.\n\nCommenting about her stint in Neighbours, she told Vanity Fair in 2014 that she “saved up enough to get me through three years unemployed.” Some reports suggest that she was paid somewhere around USD 350,000 for The Wolf of Wall Street and almost double that figure two years later for Z for Zachariah.\n\nBut by 2019, she was listed by Forbes as one of the highest-paid actresses in the world with total earnings of USD 23.5 million. The publication noted that a prime reason behind her income was the eight-figure upfront earnings from Birds of Prey of which she was also a producer.\n\nHer income in recent years is better known, especially for Greta Gerwig’s Barbie — one of the most-anticipated films of 2023.\n\nRobbie plays the titular character, who is based on the world-famous Mattel doll, and stars alongside Ryan Gosling, who plays Ken. The film also has a larger A-list star cast, including Dua Lipa, Emma Mackey, Simu Liu, Ncuti Gatwa and John Cena, playing different versions of Barbie and Ken. The film also stars America Ferrera, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, Rhea Perlman, and Will Ferrell.\n\nAccording to multiple reports both Robbie and Gosling have been paid USD 12.5 million each for Barbie. It is not clear if Robbie or any of the other actors have a share in the profits of the film, similar to how some A-list stars, such as Tom Cruise, the star of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One (2023), do in their cases.\n\nNevertheless, Robbie serves as one of the producers of the film. This means her overall paycheck from Barbie will be much higher than her acting fees of USD 12.5 million.\n\nMargot Robbie’s endorsements and businesses\n\nThe face of Calvin Klein and Chanel\n\nRobbie became the face of Calvin Klein’s Deep Euphoria fragrance in 2016. The scent has cascalone and mandarin leaf as its top notes; black rose and geranium, among others, as middle tones; and patchouli and musk as base notes.\n\nShe became a brand ambassador of Chanel in 2018 and since then has worn the brand’s dresses for most of her public appearances. However, it is unclear if she continues to be the brand ambassador of the luxury fashion brand, as Robbie has been seen wearing a series of Bottega Veneta creations in November 2022.\n\nThough she picked a Chanel for her 2023 Golden Globes appearance, she was seen in a Valentino at the London premiere of her film Babylon and wore Bottega Veneta in January 2023.\n\nBe it Calvin Klein, Chanel or Bottega Veneta, details of the deal in each of them are not known.\n\nNissan electric’s ambassador\n\nRobbie was named Nissan’s first electric vehicle ambassador by the Japanese auto giant in February 2017. As part of the promotional event, which was held in Monaco, Robbie went behind the wheels of a Nissan BladeGilder concept car and raced it down the streets.\n\nIn her role as Nissan Electric Vehicle Ambassador, Robbie said, “Our lives are literally turning electric, but the sad fact is that so many people around the world still don’t have access to a reliable source of electricity at all.”\n\nSome months later, a 2018 Daily Mail report cited a publicist saying that Robbie would be paid around USD 1 million over a period of two years as part of her ambassadorship.\n\nMargot Robbie’s production company\n\nMargot Robbie co-founded the production company LuckyChap Entertainment with Tom Ackerley and some of their friends in 2014.\n\nThe production house has since released critically and commercially successful movies such as I, Tonya (2017), Promising Young Woman (2020) and Boston Strangler (2023), headlined by Robbie, Carey Mulligan and Keira Knightley, respectively.\n\nThrough her company, Robbie is also the producer of Barbie whose total production budget is an estimated USD 100 million.\n\nPapa Salt gin\n\nAlong with Tom Ackerley and industry friends, Charlie Maas, Josey McNamara and Regan Riskas, Margot Robbie used her net worth to co-found a new line of gin, Papa Salt, in May 2023.\n\nMade in Byron Bay — a coastal town in New South Wales, Australia — the gin is reportedly inspired by the east coast of Australia. The brand’s website calls it an “easy-drinking gin that celebrates the subtle taste of native Australian botanicals.”\n\nThe official site also reveals that the founders experimented with 59 recipes before coming to the right combination for Papa Gin. It has notes of zesty wax flower, hibiscus and citrus peel as well as nutty wattleseed, pink peppercorn and a hint of oyster shell.\n\nExpensive things Margot Robbie owns\n\nCar collection\n\nUnlike most other celebrities, it is difficult to find out the exact cars that Margot Robbie owns. While several reports say that she owns a Mercedes-Benz CLA, a Ford Explorer, a Mercedes G63 AMG and an Audi A6, among other cars, little can be ascertained about them.\n\nRobbie has hardly ever been seen in them and, unlike Henry Cavill who posts pictures of his rides on social media, she never talked about four-wheelers while she was active.\n\nHowever, older pictures show that she has at least owned a Hyundai Excel, a predecessor of the Hyundai Accent. During its production run from 1985 to 1999, the Hyundai Excel was one of the most affordable cars but had features that were found in more expensive cars of its kind. Pictures suggest that Robbie drove a green Hyundai Excel. It is not clear if she still owns it.\n\nThe other car that she has been seen in is a Cadillac Escalade. Made by American automaker General Motors, the Cadillac Escalade is a full-size SUV, a favourite among celebrities. A 2023 model of the car starts at around USD 81,000 and can go up to USD 151,000. Depending on the variant, it can either have a 6.2L V8 engine or a 6.2L Supercharged V8 engine. It has a top speed of just over 200 km/h.\n\nSome reports indicate that she also owns a Nissan LEAF electric vehicle, which might make sense since she is a brand ambassador of the car brand. In fact, the Daily Mail report from December 2018 says that a publicist revealed she would likely be gifted a car by Nissan when she signed up to be their face.\n\nA 2023 Nissan LEAF goes up to 340 km on a full charge on the back of its 40 kWh battery, which can be increased to 60 kWh. The starting price of the electric car is USD 28,000.\n\nReal estate\n\nIn a short span of time, Margot Robbie strengthened her net worth on the back of smart investments in a real estate portfolio that helps her live comfortably in both the US and her home country of Australia.\n\nOne of Robbie’s best-known homes is located in the Venice Beach neighbourhood of Los Angeles. It was bought by the actor in around October 2019 for USD 5 million, shortly after she was named by Forbes as one of the world’s highest-paid female actors.\n\nThe property has three separate structures on a double-wide lot, the exact size of which is unknown. It is built like a fortress and has its own gate, alarm systems and CCTV cameras. Besides the main building, it has a two-bedroom separate structure and a cottage-style third structure. There is a three-car garage on the property as well.\n\nIn mid-2021, when parts of the property were still under construction, TMZ reported that its total worth will be an estimated USD 15 million.\n\nBesides her US address, Robbie is believed to own a home in Byron Bay. It was bought by her in 2018 for around USD 3 million. Australian media reports from the time suggest that she indeed had a look at the property located in Linnaeus Estate, which was a private gated beachfront estate, between Byron Bay and Lennox Head.\n\nThe timber-lined property is situated next to a beach. It has an all-white interior, large kitchen and designer bathroom, as well as a treehouse-like alfresco deck that extends out of the main building into the greenery-covered ground of the property.\n\nIn May 2023, Robbie and Ackerley reportedly took a look at another Byron Bay property. Reports say that the property, named Cedar Hill, is described as one of the ‘most beautiful homes’ in the country. It is situated around 10 km south of Byron Bay in a secluded place called Newrybar.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Amir Prestige (@amirprestigegroup)\n\nIt was last sold in 2019 for around USD 1.6 million, but records indicate that another USD 2 million was spent on its redevelopment.\n\nThe barn-style main building sits on 20,000 square metres. It has eight bedrooms and as many bathrooms, along with an open-style kitchen, living and dining areas. It comes with custom-designed furniture, such as a 16-chair dining table and sofas covered in bohemian textiles. The house has an infinity pool, too. Glass, concrete, recycled timber and natural stone among other materials have been used in its construction.\n\nIn 2019, Robbie spent around USD 2 million on two adjoining homes on Gold Coast in Southport, Queensland. They were bought for her mother, Sarie Kessler, and older sister, Anya Robbie. Each property has two bedrooms, three bathrooms and a garage.\n\nFive years before the dual purchase, she had also paid off her mother’s mortgage on their family home on Gold Coast. The family home was originally bought in 2007 by Sarie for around USD 300,000. It had four bedrooms, three bathrooms and a backyard pool. Some years after its mortgage was paid off, the Robbie family sold off the house.\n\nAmong her previous accommodations is a 312.5-square-metre home in a 603-square-metre plot in Hancock Park, a suburb of Los Angeles in California. It was one of the first major properties that the actor added to her portfolio. Robbie bought it in 2017, shortly after her marriage to Ackerley and their move to the US from London.\n\nThe two-floor home, built in 2016, is quite modest. It has four bedrooms, all decked in white walls and five-and-half bathrooms. A huge black chandelier hangs over a blue round sofa in the family room, which also has a fireplace. Just outside the huge floor-to-ceiling glass window of the room is the property’s outdoor pool, which has a low, yellow diving board.\n\nIn the kitchen is a Carrara marble sink and a six-seat counter. On the second floor is the master bedroom with a private balcony. The property also has a boutique wine cellar, spa, patio with a bar and pool bath, and an open-air cabana.\n\nRobbie paid around USD 2.7 million for the property when she bought it. In May 2021, she sold the property for around USD 3.5 million.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Luxury Real Estate (@cleverestates)\n\nIn 2018, Robbie paid USD 950,000 to buy a house owned by Milk (2008) director Dustin Lance Black in Hollywood Heights in Los Angeles. Robbie bought the property as an investment and is, therefore, believed to have never lived in it. Originally built in the 1950s, the actual size of the two-bedroom and one-bath home is 88 square metres.\n\nRobbie commissioned a restoration work on the property, following which the walls and the furnishings were given new colours and fittings. Right behind the property are two terraces that are built into a hillside and have enough space for seating. The uppermost terrace overlooks the house and gives a fantastic view of the neighbourhood.\n\nReports suggest that the house was immediately put on rent for USD 5,000 per month after Robbie bought it. In December 2020, she put it up for sale for USD 1.2 million.\n\n(Hero image: IMDb; Featured image: Courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures/Courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures – © 2023 Warner Bros.

        "text": "It's official: Margot Robbie is the real-life Barbie we all needed in our lives—and, no, not because she has an impeccable wardrobe. Or because of her ability to shape-shift into a range of different characters. And not even because she just gave us an up-close-and-personal tour of the Dreamhouse for the upcoming Greta Gerwig film. Right now we consider her a living doll—and a role model who is the opposite of plastic—because of her incredible generosity.\n\nFans recently unearthed an old clip of Margot Robbie detailing how she paid off her mom's mortgage as soon as she could afford it—and if you didn't love the Barbie star already, you certainly will now. \"When I first started working and I was speaking with a business manager, they said, 'You should invest your money, what do you want to with your money?'\" she explains in the 2014 clip. \"And I was like, 'First thing I want is to pay off my mum's mortgage.'\"\n\nWhile that major money goal didn't happen overnight, she stuck to her promise and pocketed away a portion of her paychecks for movies like the Wolf of Wall Street. She added: \"Every couple of months, I'd check in and be like, 'Do we have enough?'\" Eventually, she saved up enough, did all the necessary paperwork, and paid for the $490,000 mortgage in honor of her mother's 60th birthday. \"It's what any kid dreams of doing for their parent,\" Robbie says. \"It was a big secret to be sitting on for so long, but definitely one of the best moments of my life.\"\n\nWe're not crying, you're crying—and you're not alone here. One commenter gushed, \"What a lovely person. \"Margot is a walking green flag,\" another fan wrote. \"Everything is good about her.\" A third viewer kept it simple: \"Margot, the truest Barbie.\"\n\nOf course, Robbie isn't the only celebrity to pay her good fortune forward. Jackie Chan is reportedly donating every dollar of his $400 million net worth to charity, while stars including Allison Janney and Heidi Klum have appeared on Celebrity IOU their inner circle to home renovations. It all goes to show you that—just like Barbie—kindness never goes out of style."

        "text": "July 07, 2023 04:30 pm | Updated 05:53 pm IST\n\nYes, Damien Chazelle’s love-letter to Hollywood is over three hours long, but it does zip by in a hectic cavalcade of colourful excess. While it might be empty calories and gratuitous especially in the nudity department, fast food (once in a while) is fun, no? Carrying on the fast food analogy, continued consumption could make you sick and there is much in Babylon that could make you nauseous, including projectile vomiting and hawking great gobs of saliva (ugh).\n\nThough Babylon has the scale for the big screen, watching it on a streaming platform gives you the choice of taking a break and watching cement dry or something and then returning to the sensory riot.\n\nBabylon Director: Damien Chazelle Cast: Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, Diego Calva, Jean Smart, Jovan Adepo, Li Jun Li Story line: How a young immigrant rises up the studio ranks to become an executive and the characters that help or hinder him on his path Run time: 189 minutes\n\nThe term ‘Babylon,’ like Kandahar and Samarkand, is evocative, a shorthand for arts, culture, oppression and excess. Fun fact; the Bible refers to Babylon as Babel, and Brad Pitt, who kills it as silent movie star Jack Conrad in Babylon, also featured in Alejandro González Iñárritu’s Oscar-winning Babel (2006).\n\nBack to Babylon, which opens in 1926 Bel-Air, with Manny (Diego Calva), trying to convince a truck driver to transport an elephant to a studio executive’s party. Those first 30-bacchanalian-minutes introduce all the major players in the story and set the tone. Apart from Conrad and Manny, there is brash, aspiring starlet Nellie LaRoy (Margot Robbie), risqué cabaret singer Lady Fay Zhu (Li Jun Li), the trumpeter Sidney Palmer (Jovan Adepo) and gossip writer Elinor St. John (Jean Smart).\n\nNellie is discovered as she dances in wild abandon as the replacement for an actor who overdosed at the party. Hollywood is in a state of flux with silent movies being replaced by talkies. The change affects the players differently. Manny is all about solutions and he is able to adapt to the changing scenario; Conrad, Nellie and Fay not so much.\n\nThere are drug dealers (like aspiring actor The Count (Rory Scovel) who sells drugs in peanuts), copious amounts of alcohol and copulation, rattlesnake fights, accidental deaths, heads stuck in toilet bowls, gangsters, chained alligators and suicides. There are also quieter moments with the one where Elinor dissects the ephemerality of stardom for a befuddled Conrad being pragmatic and poignant in equal measure.\n\nThough the screenplay is not as tight as it could have been — Babylon plays out like a loose string of audacious scenes — the razor-sharp editing, sumptuous costumes and to-die-for music transport you into a psychedelic fever dream.\n\nThe acting is a scorcher. Pitt is on point as the talented, good natured but ultimately ineffectual Conrad. Robbie is like an Energizer bunny as Nellie, “the maelstrom of bad taste and sheer magic” as Ina (Olivia Wilde), Conrad’s ex wife comments. She fizzes with ideas, talent, a brash sexiness and a self-destructive streak. Tobey Maguire is riveting as manic mob boss James McKay, as is Max Minghella as producer Irving Thalberg. Samara Weaving weighs in as Nellie’s rival Constance Moore, who Nellie leaves far behind.\n\nApart from the montage at the end of the film, which drags you out of your drug-induced thrill ride, quite like the man from Porlock, and the dreadful blurring of body parts under the guise of censorship, Babylon is an eyeball-searing trip into a version of writer-director Chazelle’s Hollywood.\n\nBabylon is currently streaming on Amazon Prime Video"

America Ferrera plays a human with a deep love for the iconic toy, Kate McKinnon plays Weird Barbie, Issa Rae plays President Barbie and Michael Cera plays Allan (based on a short-lived Mattel doll.)\n\nEntertainment reporter Kim Holcomb talked to the actors in Los Angeles.\n\nHOLCOMB: \"You’re both professionals, but the first time you saw each other in the roller blading outfits, what was your actual reaction?\"\n\nGOSLING: \"It's all just a neon haze to me.\"\n\nROBBIE: \"It was both hilarious and mortifying at the same time.\"\n\nGOSLING: \"Margot had brought her Australian family…”\n\nROBBIE: “We're not bringing this up…”\n\nGOSLING: “And they were very disappointed in my rollerblading skills.\"\n\nROBBIE: \"It was just my Aunt Jackie.”\n\nGOSLING: “I was fixated on that. In a way, it helped me, it gave me a focal point through the storm.\"\n\nROBBIE: \"That was the one day on the set where I could do something just a tiny bit better than you.”\n\nGOSLING: “Oh. She’s good.”\n\nHOLCOMB: \"Kate, am I correct in assuming you were cast, in part, because you're so limber?\"\n\nMCKINNON: \"Having studied dance for my entire life and being able to fully lift my leg over and around my head, that's mainly why I was cast. And I was told that. (laughter) No, I'm not limber and the splits you may see in the film are fake. I can go about two feet.\"\n\nHOLCOMB: “Everyone is talking about Barbie energy and Ken-rgy. What is Allan energy?\"\n\nCERA: “Allan is sort of a sad figure, he sort of exists in a nether space, in limbo. So it's not the kind of energy you want to inhabit. It's sort of a repellent energy.\"\n\nHOLCOMB: “What is Gloria energy?”\n\nFERRERA: \"She's a grown woman and she loves Barbie. And you know what? She's not apologizing for it… we all have relationships to what we loved and what we believed in and what inspired us as children, and at what point do our perspectives on those things really shift and change? And also, what do we get to keep? Like, how much magic do we get to keep in our lives?\"\n\nHOLCOMB: \"Ryan, I have to say your performance many times reminded me of my son when he was, like, six. Did someone inspire those parts of your performance?”\n\nGOSLING: “My kids, for sure. But a lot of it was just sort of - I don't know what happened, honestly.\"\n\nROBBIE: \"I think part of the humor is seeing two grown adults having full-on tantrums like they're 3-year-olds… this movie is bizarre - it goes to a lot of places - but us acting ridiculous is prevalent throughout.\"\n\nHOLCOMB: “Did you take home a souvenir?”\n\nRAE: “I was given a souvenir, they made us this amazing Barbie book. And I took the printed script, because it was like super top secret and let me tell you, that script - they sent it to you in an app, and I screen shot a page, and it just completely shut down.”\n\nCERA: “Oh, really?”\n\nRAE: “Completely shut down, and they were like, ‘Excuse me, don't ever do that again.’ And I was like, ‘I’m so sorry!’ It was an accident, I didn’t even want the page… but then they gave a printed script on set and I took that as a souvenir.”"

        "text": "Fans are becoming increasingly convinced that Margot Robbie’s Barbie will be a lesbian, as promotion for the pastel pink, plastic and fantastic film reaches its crescendo.\n\nWe’re less than three short weeks away from Greta Gerwig’s Barbie finally landing in cinemas on 21 July, yet fans are still not crystal clear on what the plot will entail.\n\nWe’ve been gifted with several trailers, and from what fans can glean, Margot Robbie’s Barbie will face the harrowing experience of losing her doll-like perfection – that means flat feet, cold showers and the inability to gracefully float down from her Dreamhouse each morning.\n\nAlongside bleach blonde babe Ken (Ryan Gosling), she’ll have to travel into the real world to discover the truth about why her Barbie fantasy is falling apart at the seams.\n\nIt’s an intentionally vague plot, with director Gerwig only dropping hints that the film was inspired by “disco” music and “technicolour musicals like The Wizard of Oz“.\n\nOne plot point that is clear, though, is this is a film about Barbies – not Kens. In addition to Robbie’s Barbie, there’s Dua Lipa as Mermaid Barbie, Emma Mackey as Physicist Barbie, Issa Rae as President Barbie, and Hari Nef as Doctor Barbie, to name but a few.\n\nOn the Ken side of things, on the other hand, there’s Ryan Gosling as just Ken, Ncuti Gatwa as just Ken, Simu Liu as just Ken, etc.\n\nYou may like to watch\n\nIt’s evident that in Barbieland, men aren’t s**t.\n\nNow Barbie obsessors and sleuths have hooked onto a new theory that Robbie’s leading lady will actually be even more uninterested in men than the trailer makes out.\n\nWhy do fans think Barbie is a lesbian?\n\nWell, the first reason is her apparent complete and utter disinterest in spending any time with Ken at all.\n\nIn the trailer, we see her leave Barbieland and embark on her mission of entering the real world, and she doesn’t appear to have told Ken where she’s off to – until he pops up in the back of her car.\n\nIn another part of the trailer, Ken suggests staying over at Barbie’s house, and though they both have no idea what they’re supposed to do as boyfriend and girlfriend, it’s clear that she’s not interested in anything physical.\n\nHowever, eagle-eyed fans have picked up on a striking bit of chemistry between Barbie and another lead character instead: Gloria, played by Ugly Betty star America Ferrera, a Mattel employee who tracks Barbie down in the real world.\n\nIn one clip, when Gloria urges Barbie to jump into her car, the pair engage in what can only be described as a very longing stare.\n\nfinally getting my pink barbie girl lesbian rep??? pic.twitter.com/3u8NsJSAJJ — ellie (@C0MMANDERLEXAS) June 26, 2023\n\nWith the release date creeping ever closer, the rumour mill has only picked up the pace.\n\nMargot Robbie and America Ferrera have taken part in several interviews together, with one clip in particular sending sapphics everywhere into a tailspin.\n\nDuring a conversation with ticketing company Fandango, the interviewer questioned why Robbie once thought the film would never see the light of day.\n\n“The script was … when I read it, I thought, this is genius, and they’re never going to let us make it, what a shame, this is all going to go to waste,” Robbie explained.\n\n“It’s not just that the movie is unexpected, I think it’s like, Greta kind of pushes in directions that I didn’t think they’d let us go in.”\n\nthe way i’m literally convinced Barbie is gonna be a lesbian pic.twitter.com/gLDUQI4Z1r — marissa (@poeticinemaa) June 28, 2023\n\ni’m telling y’all this barbie is a lesbian https://t.co/hgTXXPCrGw — olivia piraino (@olivetapenade_) June 27, 2023\n\nthey’ve got a hit on their hands if barbie is a lesbian pic.twitter.com/VRefJoPuqq — ria. tea’s wife (REAL) (@sapphcore) June 26, 2023\n\nDuring the same interview, Ferrara said that the film wanted to explore “how to bring Barbie into the 21st century”.\n\nIf that’s not enough to convince you, elsewhere in the conversation, the group spoke about how they used to play with Barbie dolls as a kid – with Robbie suggesting she played with her dolls by “banging them together”.\n\nFerrara responded with a laugh, and a cheeky, knowing glance.\n\nWhile there’s absolutely no confirmation that Barbie will be made into a sapphic icon, that hasn’t stopped the people of the internet from jumping for joy at the mere prospect.\n\nI am officially a lesbian Barbie truther — Sabrina (3am Edition) (@cascade_waves) July 1, 2023\n\nwait what if ken turns into the villain when he finds out barbie is actually a lesbian but during his redemption arc he finds out he is actually just pretty gay too??? https://t.co/3FS4SjCSwM — vero (@shaunapolxgist) June 28, 2023\n\nbased on how many times i made my barbies kiss during my childhood and didn’t gaf about my ken dolls i’d say queer kids co-opted the barbie is a lesbian movement and they’d be sooo smart to make it canon https://t.co/w8l6XslXsD — t♡̶ (@eunsoobs) June 28, 2023\n\nidk why but im feeling that the barbie movie is lesbian🤔🤔🤔 — shoe🤓 seeing taylor 05-06/06-06 (@slayvermore) July 1, 2023\n\n“From what I’ve heard Margot had a bit of creative control and we all know she’s been wanting to play a sapphic character for years,” theorised one person. “Thinking they’re going to make barbie a lesbian might not be as delusional as we think.”\n\n“They’ve got a hit on their hands if Barbie is a lesbian,” said another, alongside a behind the scenes clip of Margot Robbie and America Ferrara roller skating, hand in hand.\n\n“Margot saying they would never let Greta’s Barbie happen because it’s more unexpected … BARBIE LESBIAN CONFIRMED,” concluded a third.\n\nBarbie lands in cinemas on 21 July."

        "text": "It's official. Or maybe it is not yet. But as per projections, Margot Robbie-led upcoming Barbie movie is on track to defeat Christopher Nolan's biopic-thriller Oppenheimer at the box office. As per Deadline, Barbie, based on Mattel's fashion toy, is tracking for an impressive sum of $80 to $100 million in its opening weekend. This is double the projected collections of Oppenheimer. For months now, film buffs have been eagerly awaiting the release of both movies to see which one comes out on top. While Barbie was always considered to have more value for commercial moviegoers, it is wise never to underestimate Nolan, whose movie releases are events unto themselves.\n\nThus far, though, it appears the Greta Gerwig directorial will win. Both movies, it must be noted, have a production budget of $100 million. What is Barbie all about?\n\nBarbie and Ken, having faced expulsion from the idyllic Barbie Land due to their imperfections, embark on an adventure of self-exploration in the realm of reality. The official synopsis of the film reads, \"To live in Barbie Land is to be a perfect being in a perfect place. Unless you have a full-on existential crisis. Or you’re a Ken.\" Directed by Greta Gerwig and written by her and her filmmaker husband Noah Baumbach, the film has a huge cast with well-known names, including Will Ferrell, Kate McKinnon, Michael Cera, Emma Mackey, America Ferrera, Alexandra Shipp, Ariana Greenblatt, Emerald Fennell, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Sharon Rooney, Anna Cruz Kanye, Ritu Arya, Conor Swindell, Jamie Demetriou, Marisa Abela, Issa Rae, Hari Nef, and Ncuti Gatwa.\n\nWhat is Oppenheimer all about?\n\nNolan's star-studded film follows the life and times of one J Robert Oppenheimer, an American theoretical physicist who is called the \"father of the atomic bomb\" for his contribution to the Manhattan Project, which led to the invention of the atomic bomb. Cillian Murphy essays the role of Oppenheimer. But the film has a veritable army of big names in the supporting cast, including Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Rami Malek, Florence Pugh, Benny Safdie, Michael Angarano, Josh Hartnett and Kenneth Branagh.\n\nBoth Barbie and Oppenheimer will release on July 21.\n\nWATCH WION LIVE HERE"

        "text": "Margot Robbie has a dream life. I mean, she's already a bonafide superstar and is soon set to star in the biggest summer blockbuster of all time, Greta Gerwig's Barbie. But with all good career milestones comes some personal balance, which she very much has, thanks to her solid marriage with her husband, Tom Ackerley.\n\nBut just who is Tom, and how did he capture the heart of one of the most in-demand actresses of our generation? Well, it's been ten years since the lovebirds first met on the set of a film, with their friendship quickly developing into a romance and, years later, a low-key, intimate wedding in her native Australia.\n\nProving that they are destined to be together at all costs, the pair has also forged a successful working relationship thanks to the production company they founded together in 2014.\n\nJon Kopaloff\n\nWith the duo being undeniably strong from the get-go, it's safe to say that little is known about the British film producer, 33, who won the heart of the 32-year-old Wolf of Wall Street icon. So, to learn more about the husband of Margot Robbie read on.\n\nHow did Margot meet Tom?\n\nThe pair met in 2013 on the set of Suite Française, in which Margot played the role of Celine Joseph and Tom worked behind the scenes as the third assistant director.\n\nThey first became best friends but began dating the following year. However, that wasn't before some concern on Margot's end, as she wasn't necessarily looking for something serious at the time, and she didn't want to make things weird between them if he didn't reciprocate her feelings.\n\n\"I was the ultimate single gal. The idea of relationships made me want to vomit,\" the Australian actress said in an interview with Vogue. \"And then this crept up on me. We were friends for so long. I was always in love with him, but I thought, 'Oh, he would never love me back. Don't make it weird, Margot. Don't be stupid and tell him that you like him.' And then it happened, and I was like, 'Of course, we're together. This makes so much sense, the way nothing has ever made sense before.'\"\n\nNeedless to say, Margot and Tom knew they were meant for each other, and they also knew they would work well in a professional setting, which allowed them to start LuckyChap Entertainment with their friends Josey McNamara and Sophia Kerr.\n\nWhen did Tom and Margot get married?\n\nThe couple has always been keen on keeping things low-key and never made news of their engagement official. They secretly tied the knot in a private ceremony in Byron Bay, New South Wales, in December 2016, with Margot later confirming the news on Instagram."

I say 'guess who used to live in my flat'.\n\n\"Most people get it because if you live in Clapham, you know she used to live there.\n\n\"They say 'that's what they all say, that Margot Robbie used to live at my flat'. It's a story to tell people.\"\n\nDavid D, 28, who moved into the house two years ago, said: \"I didn't know that she had lived here until I moved in.\n\n\"It was a few weeks after when some of my housemates said about it and had messaged to say this is Margot Robbie's house.

Maybe one of us will follow in their footsteps!\"\n\nFashion worker Sam G, 26, from Wales, and Irish lad Jordan, 28, complete the current gang.\n\nDespite now living among the glitz and glamour of LA, pictures of Margot's Clapham group suggest a hard-drinking lifestyle and a \"party\" house rep back in 2014.\n\nMargot previously described having a \"24-hour party for my 24th birthday\" on Jimmey Kimmel Live where she \"ended up back in our courtyard and popped another bottle of champagne\".\n\n\"Our house is definitely a party house like theirs was,\" David said.\n\n\"There was a bit of a rep and obviously it's a side terrace house with a big back garden and lots of room to bring people around.\n\n\"We've tried to keep up that rep as much as we can.\"\n\nThere has also been gossip that the Aussie could return to the house and reminisce on her boozier days.\n\n\"There was one story where the previous tenants were asked by Margot if she could rent the house for the weekend to have a party,\" Alice said.\n\n\"I think they all had to move out for the weekend, so didn't take her up on the offer. I wish she would call us!\"\n\nDavid added: \"I did hear there were rumours of a garden gnome that she had wanted to come back to see back in 2019.\"\n\n7 Almost a decade later, four average Joes now occupy the same brick and mortar Credit: David D - Supplied"

This will be the first time the union has gone on strike since 1980.\n\n\"It came with great sadness that we came to this crossroads, but we have no choice,\" she said at a press conference. \"We are the victims here. We are being victimized by a greedy entity.\"\n\nThe Nanny actress also told reporters that the union—which failed to reach an agreement with AMPTP when their contract expired on July 12—went into negotiations \"in earnest, thinking we would avert a strike.\"\n\n\"At some point, the jig is up,\" she continued. \"You cannot keep being dwindled and marginalized and disrespected and dishonored.\"\n\nDrescher noted that \"the gravity of this move is not lost on me,\" adding, \"But at some point, you have to say no.

A recent video posted by Architectural Digest featuring Australian actress Margot Elise Robbie, who will be playing the role of Barbie, gives us a tour of the entire production and what went on behind the scenes of this fascinating set. Barbie Dream House(Architectural Digest)\n\nThe entire basis and theme of the setup were done on ‘Pink, and it truly gives the viewers an experience of bringing the animated sequel to life. In the video tour of the Barbie Dream House, we get a glimpse of the house, which consists of the entrance at the very beginning of the video, which is later opened by Barbie herself (Margot Robbie). As the tour progresses, we get an insight into how the entire set is made and what thought went into bringing the whole idea of Barbie to life.\n\nStay tuned with breaking news on HT Channel on Facebook. Join Now\n\nThe Movie gives an overview of Barbie coming to the human world and facing the challenges of convincing people that she's actually Barbie, and the problems eventually build on top of what the trailers have showcased so far. So to conclude, the movie wouldn't really be presented much in the Barbie universe, but this shows the amount of effort and planning that has gone into the integral segments of the movie.\n\nThe Dream House is inspired by Palm Springs, and hence we can see a lot of attributes with respect to the sunsets they used in the backdrop of the set, and the way they have added onto palm trees to bring in the little tropical aspect makes the buildup very detailed and interesting.\n\nWhen the Barbie merchandise first hit the market, it was a big success, and we also saw the versatility of the merchandise in terms of its outfit and display. There was a Barbie for every occasion and outfit, and this keeps the team and production of Barbie up to the same level of flexibility in order to make the movie more connecting to the audience."

        "text": "Margot Robbie is raking in big Barbie bucks.\n\nThe 33-year-old star of Barbie, who also produced the film, is expected to earn $50 million as part of a deal that combines her salary and back-end box office bonuses, according to Variety, which cited multiple sources. Her husband Tom Ackerley is also a producer on the film.\n\nReps for Warner Bros. and Robbie did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's requests for comment.\n\nBarbie has so far surpassed $1 billion at the worldwide box office, making Greta Gerwig the highest-grossing female director of a live-action movie at the global box office, per The Hollywood Reporter. It topped 2019's Captain Marvel, which was co-directed by Anna Boden.\n\nRobbie produced Barbie with her company LuckyChap Entertainment, which previously produced Birds of Prey and the Oscar-winning Promising Young Woman.\n\nAmerica Ferrera, Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig. Han Myung-Gu/WireImage\n\nShe hand-picked Gerwig to direct and co-write the project with Gerwig's real-life partner Noah Baumbach. Originally, Robbie wanted Gal Gadot to play Barbie before Gerwig convinced her to take the part.\n\n“It wasn’t that I ever wanted to play Barbie, or dreamt of being Barbie, or anything like that. This is going to sound stupid, but I really didn’t even think about playing Barbie until years into developing the project,\" Robbie told Vogue in May.\n\nBefore Barbie achieved its box-office milestone, which the film clinched just over two weeks after its release, Robbie told Collider that she pitched Barbie as a film that could make $1 billion.\n\n\"I think my pitch in the green-light meeting was the studios have prospered so much when they’re brave enough to pair a big idea with a visionary director,\" she said to the outlet.\n\nAn example she gave while \"naming anything that’s been incredible and made a ton of money for the studios over the years\" was \"dinosaurs and [Steven] Spielberg,\" aka 1993's Jurassic Park, which launched a movie franchise.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nMargot Robbie and Tom Ackerley.

And I think I told them that it’d make a billion dollars, which maybe I was overselling, but we had a movie to make, okay?\" she joked in the interview, before the film ended up making good on that promise.\n\nBarbie revitalized the movie theater business this summer, thanks also in part to the internet's viral \"Barbenheimer\" trend, challenging fans to see both Barbie and Christopher Nolan's three-hour historical drama Oppenheimer. The two films opened in theaters on the same weekend, breaking moviegoing records together.\n\n\n\nBarbie is in theaters now.\n\n"

The \"Barbie\" cast worked out together while they were filming in London, which Higgins told the outlet was a \"really collaborative, fun experience.\"\n\n\"Everyone was just up for a laugh and to feel good, it wasn't aesthetics,\" he added. \"It wasn't like the superhero movies that I usually work on. 'Barbie' was more about: let's just feel good, and if you feel good, that's going to translate on camera.\"\n\nThe Kens did four days of strength work and two days of Pilates a week. Warner Bros.\n\nHiggins also told the outlet that the Barbies in the cast typically did four days of Pilates and two days of strength and conditioning work per week, while the Kens in the cast — including Gosling and Simu Liu — did four days of strength work and two days of Pilates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn strength and conditioning days, Higgins had the cast do a circuit-style workout that included exercises for shoulders, biceps, back, and lower body. He told PopSugar the circuit always finished with a move for abs, which was often a plank.\n\nPlanks help build strength and muscle throughout the body, and Robbie isn't the only celebrity with an impressive record. Cher once revealed that she's held a plank for five minutes.\n\nWhen it comes to staying fit, Higgins told PopSugar that it's good to mix things up and try new workouts.\n\n\"Why don't you learn how to do it all?\" he said. \"And you can, because the body responds significantly well to diversity.\""

        "text": "OK, since everyone else seems to be writing about her, it’s time for me to jump on the Barbie bandwagon.\n\nFirst, I have to tell you I still have my childhood Barbie and Ken that came to me as hand-me-downs from my older sister, Susan.\n\nApparently, Susan had the first ever Barbie…the long haired blonde who came dressed in a black and white knitted one-piece swimsuit.\n\nUnfortunately, all that’s left of the original is the bottom half of the suit…why someone cut off the top half, we will never know. Maybe it was our sister, Laura (born six years after Susan and six years before me), who preferred catching tadpoles over playing with Barbies.\n\nThe Barbie I inherited is a strawberry blond with bubble-cut hair from the early 60s. She’s much less valuable than the original, which is going for upwards of $25,000 these days. I’ve only recently come to appreciate the distinction. The new movie has prompted me to do some research.\n\nTo Susan and me, Barbie was a clothes horse. Before I was born, Susan would save her pennies and head to the Dupree drugstore on Slappey Drive in our hometown of Albany, GA to carefully select outfits and accessories.\n\nI loved dressing Barbie in those beautiful clothes that Susan purchased years before I was born, but, in the 70s, I lost interest in the newer clothes that were not as elegant or well made.\n\nLittle did I know that over the past 60-plus years, Barbie has come to represent much more than fashion. Barbie has had more than 250 groundbreaking careers for women, including astronaut, pilot, firefighter and surgeon. She’s also been a candidate in nearly every presidential election since 1992.\n\nBarbie now comes in a variety of body shapes, skin colors, ethnicity and abilities. Just this year, the first Barbie with Down syndrome was released.\n\nIn my opinion, the movie does a great job of displaying the range of Barbies, but one thing that is missing, for the most part, is the importance of pets to the iconic doll.\n\nSpoiler alert…two pets that make an appearance in the movie are dogs that caused controversy in their time and were discontinued. Tanner disgustingly ate and pooped the same plastic poop repeatedly. Sugar was part of the Palm Beach Sugar Daddy Ken set. When folks took offense to the doll’s name, Mattel tried to justify that Ken was “Sugar’s daddy.”\n\nAccording to Barbie lore, she has had more than 40 pets, including 21 dogs, six cats, 14 horses, three ponies and a parrot. (We won’t count the lion cub, giraffe, zebra, panda and chimpanzee as pets.)\n\nA chimp accompanies the Dr. Jane Goodall Barbie, released last year to honor Goodall’s groundbreaking research with chimpanzees and her nature conservation efforts. Made of recycled plastic, Goodall is just one of the Inspiring Women Barbie series that pays tribute to real-life heroines.\n\nFor those who thought Barbie was a just a body shaming bimbo, it’s good to know that, according to Mattel, the doll’s purpose has been to inspire the limitless potential in every girl.\n\nOf special note to me, there are at least three different Barbie veterinarian dolls, which I hope will inspire more girls to pursue this career and help fill a critical national shortage of vets.\n\nI also hope that if the movie has a sequel, pets play a more prominent role next time. After all, it’s estimated that more than two-thirds of American households have pets. Barbieland needs better representation than Tanner and Sugar.\n\nIf you would like to add a pet to your home, please adopt during our “Big Dog Summer” promotion, now through Aug. 9.\n\nTo view adoptable animals, pasadenahumane.org/adopt\n\nDia DuVernet is president and CEO of Pasadena Humane. pasadenahumane.org"

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n\nAs Barbie finally hits theaters this weekend, star Margot Robbie is in the spotlight for her performance as the titular doll. But who is her real-life Ken?\n\nRobbie, who is very private, quietly tied the knot to producer Tom Ackerley in 2016, after they dated for three years. Now, the two run a production company together—and the latest film they produced is none other than Barbie.\n\n\"I'm always nervous to start any job. I have this complete crisis of faith and think, 'Oh my gosh, I'm not even good at acting and I can't do this,'\" Robbie told the Daily Mirror about Ackerley in 2021. \"Every time I do a movie, I turn to my husband and I'm like, 'I don't think I can do this'. He says something like, 'You do this every time. You'll be fine.' \"\n\n\n\nHere's everything you need to know about Margot Robbie's husband Tom Ackerley:\n\nHe's a British film producer.\n\nRobbie and Ackerley at an Oscars afterparty in March 2018. Jon Kopaloff // Getty Images\n\nAckerley, who was raised in Guildford, Surrey and attended Godalming College, works as a producer. \"I seem to love a lot of British things,\" Robbie joked to The Mirror in 2021. \"I love Harry Potter, I love my husband and I love Love Island. It’s great.\"\n\nIn addition to Barbie, he has produced Promising Young Woman, Maid, and I, Tonya, among other projects.\n\nRobbie and Ackerley met in 2013.\n\nThe couple pose for a photo in November 2022. Phillip Faraone // Getty Images\n\nThey met on the set of Suite Française; she was an actress in the film and he was an assistant director. They started dating a year later. \"I was the ultimate single gal. The idea of relationships made me want to vomit,\" Robbie later said. \"And then this crept up on me. We were friends for so long. I was always in love with him, but I thought, Oh, he would never love me back. Don't make it weird, Margot. Don't be stupid and tell him that you like him. And then it happened, and I was like, Of course we're together. This makes so much sense, the way nothing has ever made sense before.\"\n\nThe same year they started dating, they created production company LuckyChap Entertainment alongside friends Josey McNamara and Sophia Kerr. \"I’m a great advocate of doing business with your partner,\" Robbie Porter in 2018. \"Being married is actually the most fun ever, life got way more fun somehow. I have a responsibility being someone’s wife, I want to be better.\"\n\nThey got engaged and married in secret.\n\nMargot Robbie and Tom Ackerley attend the world premiere of Barbie together. Axelle/Bauer-Griffin // Getty Images\n\nThe private couple tied the knot in December 2016 in Australia. After, instead of going on a honeymoon, they went to work on I, Tonya—and took their delayed honeymoon to Tahiti after shooting wrapped. \"We did [I, Tonya] instead of our honeymoon. There were times we were sitting in a car parked in Atlanta freezing cold being like, 'We should be on a beach right now. We should be on a honeymoon. What are we doing?!' Following our dream,\" Robbie told Extra in 2017.\n\nHe was an extra in third Harry Potter movies.\n\n\"My husband is in the Harry Potter movies. I know, I was like, 'Had you told me sooner we would've been married very quickly,'\" Robbie, a major Potter fan, said in 2020. \"But he was an extra when he was a little kid — he was one of the Slytherin extras when Draco pushes some kids out of the way to see Buckbeak in the third book. He pushes my husband out of the way.\"\n\nHe's on Instagram, but rarely posts.\n\nRobbie has no social media accounts, but Ackerley has an Instagram, @alpha_meows. Robbie sometimes appears, like in this slideshow of photos from their trip to Lapland (swipe through):\n\nAs of this writing, however, he hasn't posted since March 2021."

YouTube/Bryce Vine\n\nThe music video stars Vine as somewhat of a Dr. Frankenstein, who creates a doll-like version of his dream woman — a.k.a. Shay, 38, who comes to life and eventually turns evil. The reality star has been friends with Vine for a decade and wanted to work with the \"La La Land\" performer for years.\n\n\"It's funny 'cause I've never seen one episode of Vanderpump Rules, and I don't really want to 'cause I know the kind of person she is off-screen,\" Vine tells PEOPLE. \"She’s been a supporter of my music forever and earlier in the day before the director called her, Scheana texted her husband [Brock Davies] saying she wished she was the lead of my 'Drew Barrymore' video. When the phone rang offering the role, she dropped everything to make it happen.\"\n\nThe new single marks Vine's second song inspired by an A-list movie star following 2018's \"Drew Barrymore,\" his breakout hit, which he references in the new song's lyrics: \"I'm over that Drew Barry / Need a spice girl.\" (Hopefully Barrymore isn't jealous, as she told him on The Kelly Clarkson Show in 2019, \"I'm such a big fan of yours, and I am so lucky to be the name of one of your songs.\")\n\nBryce Vine in December 2021. Michael Tullberg/Getty\n\n\"Sometimes the hardest part of writing songs in the studio is figuring out what the hell you even wanna write about,\" the musician tells PEOPLE, explaining that he invited his girlfriend, model Ellis Mae, to the studio for \"some good feminine energy\" on the day \"Margot Robbie\" was written.\n\n\"She arrived in a fully pink getup with her blonde hair perfectly wavy and a bubbly disposition that screams California in the best way,\" says Vine. \"We decided then to write the song completely around her and how a girl like her would want to be sung about.\"\n\nWhile he hasn't spoken to Robbie, 33, just yet, he does have a message for her if she happens to watch the music video. \"Even though we can’t be together,\" says Vine, \"just know that you’re iconic, and you set a new bar for what I look for in a woman.\"\n\n"

Together with her sidekick Ken (Ryan Gosling), Barbie inhabits a pink-hued feminist paradise where the president, the nine justices of the Supreme Court and all Nobel Prize winners are women.\n\nTroubled and bewildered by hitherto alien thoughts of death as well as by a sudden physical imperfection — a patch of cellulite on her leg — our heroine consults one of her many alter egos, Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon). The problem, it seems, is that whoever is currently playing with Standard Barbie is sad and her sorrow is affecting her toy.\n\nBarbie and Ken journey to the real world\n\nSo it’s time to journey to the real world to meet the cause of the difficulty and, presumably, cheer her up sufficiently to restore the status quo. Ken stows away in the back seat of Barbie’s car and thus gets to share in the adventure.\n\nArriving in Los Angeles, Barbie discovers the tribulations — and Ken the joys — of patriarchy. Barbie also learns to her surprise that, far from being revered as a symbol of female empowerment, she’s reviled as the embodiment of women’s subjugation.\n\nKen manages to return to Barbie Land first and proceeds to imbue it with male dominance. Thus, by the time Barbie gets back to her natural setting, it’s not only been tainted by warped values but turned topsy-turvy.\n\nBarbie will need the cooperation of all her many eponymous iterations to avert cultural and political disaster. Fortunately, she’ll also have the help of Gloria (America Ferrera) and Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt), a mother-and-daughter duo from the realm of human beings.\n\nMovie not acceptable for little kids\n\nAs scripted by director Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, the picture bemoans the plight of women while blithely stereotyping men as selfish, childish and aggressive. With the rivalry of the sexes raging, little of the humor (Will Ferrell plays the dizzy CEO of Mattel) and less of the sentiment (Rhea Perlman plays the wise granny who co-founded the company) works.\n\nDespite all the controversy that continues to swirl around her, Barbie has undeniably proved a long-lasting source of enjoyment for youngsters. Her namesake movie, by contrast, is too closely focused on its own agenda to provide older viewers with much entertainment and too freewheeling to be acceptable for little kids.\n\nThe film contains stylized physical violence, a few instances each of mild swearing and crass talk, mature wordplay and brief sexual and anatomical humor. The OSV News classification is A-II – adults and adolescents. The Motion Picture Association rating is PG-13 – parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13.\n\n– – –\n\nJohn Mulderig is media reviewer for OSV News. Follow him on Twitter @JohnMulderig1."

        "text": "The thing I keep hearing from people in Hollywood is “I don’t know how she got away with it.” When a theatrically released movie is made at this budget level, anything idiosyncratic or challenging often gets whittled down by studio notes. How were you able to preserve your sensibility the whole way through this process?\n\nI was originally meant to just write it with Noah, and then we finished the script and that was the thing that made me want to direct it. It felt so clear to me: If they didn’t want to make that [version], I didn’t need to make it. Margot, as the producer and star, was really the first person to line up and say, “I want to do it her way.” And then as we started adding collaborators and gathering more cast, suddenly there was a large number of people who were excited to do something that was this, excuse the pun, out of the box.\n\nPart of me thinks that because it was all so idiosyncratic and so wild, it was almost like no one really knew where to start taking it apart. Like, where are you going to start hacking away at how strange it was? Maybe because there was this sense of sheer joy behind it, it was this hard thing to say, “Oh no, we don’t want that thing that’s sheer joy.” People wanted it to exist, in all its weirdness.\n\nEven the movie’s inciting incident is pretty heady. I’m trying to imagine how the executives reacted when you told them, “Well, things really kick off when Barbie starts having irrepressible thoughts of death.”\n\nI know! We had the idea of the movie starting off like this whirligig, and that line becomes something where she almost breaks the movie. And what do you do after you’ve broken the movie? Her character tries to just keep the movie going normally again, but there’s no way to do it. But yeah, I don’t know that anyone totally knew what the tone of this was going to be until it was all done. I mean, within the group of people who were deeply making it, we knew, but it was truly an act of faith for everyone else."

I was a dancer at first in Florida, but every time I had a dance I would treat it like the biggest performance of my life. So I’ve always kind of had that bug in me, to perform,” she says. “I came to L.A. for a family vacation and my dad knows a lot of people here, so we were just saying ‘hi’ to his old friends and then I was sent out by my manager at the time for a bunch of meetings and I didn’t know what they were. I just thought I was meeting people, but they were actually auditions for three different roles and I got all three of them in the same week. And that kind of snowballed.”\n\nBig Break: Greenblatt stars in the summer’s most anticipated film “Barbie,” as one of the humans (America Ferrera is her mom in the film). The audition came to her without revealing what the project actually was.\n\n“I didn’t know much about what it would actually be, but I just knew Greta [Gerwig] was involved with it, and that’s the only thing I needed to hear to put my life into the audition,” she says. “I did the first round of normal auditions and then once I realized Margot [Robbie] was Barbie and I started connecting the dots and the announcements were coming out, I’m like, ‘oh my God, this is insanity.’ I fully was just trying to keep my cool and get to know my character really well.”\n\nAriana Greenblatt at the premiere of “Barbie” in Los Angeles. Christopher Polk for WWD\n\nGrowing Up Barbie: “I grew up with the Barbie Dreamhouse. But it’s weird because I didn’t have a lot of Barbies: I had a lot of Monster High dolls, so I put my Monster High dolls inside the Dreamhouse and acted like it was their house,” Greenblatt says. “But I always loved watching the Barbie Dreamhouse show.”\n\nBarbie Bonding: “I got really close with Alexandra Shipp, who was one of the Barbies. I would always go into her trailer while filming and she would give me little tarot card readings. We would eat snacks together and talk about life,” Greenblatt says. “Same with America, who plays my mom. And Margot too, towards the end of filming; she became like an older sister and I would tell her about my boy problems and my school problems and she was just always there to listen and we would gossip about my life and it was great. She was like my little outlet.”\n\nCareer Goals: “I think Natalie Portman has had such a great career. She’s been doing it since she was really young as well, and I think she’s navigated it in a beautiful way. And she went to school and she’s really smart and well spoken. So I really like her career. Also Saoirse Ronan, I think she has an incredible career, and she’s also so young still. I think women like that, who have paved the way for themselves and also managed to either prioritize school or prioritize other things too, which is really cool.”\n\nUp Next: “Obviously with this writer’s strike, everything is kind of crazy, but I definitely have a few things still that will be coming out — some I cannot talk about at all. Yeah. But one that has already been announced is ‘Borderlands’ that should be coming out towards the end of the year. But yeah, you’ll see me more. You’ll get tired of me.”\n\nInterview was conducted before the SAG-AFTRA strike."

The “Love Island” star has one line in the film in which he plays a Ken in Barbieland.\n\nMorgan highlighted that Taylor’s trajectory from reality TV to starring in a blockbuster movie is “not a normal progression for ‘Love Island.’”\n\n“It’s fairly overwhelming,” replied Taylor.\n\nAccording to Morgan, the story about how Taylor got the part is “equally mind-blowing.”\n\nSome of Taylor’s friends had been at a movie premier that Robbie was attending and they were invited to an afterparty that she was throwing. Taylor joined them at the afterparty where he was introduced to Robbie.\n\nRobbie is known to be a huge “Love Island” fan, publicly voicing her support for the show in multiple interviews. When Taylor met her, she already knew who he was.\n\n“And then I started talking about male genitalia and the rest is history,” said Taylor.\n\n“Was this true?” Morgan questioned.\n\n“I didn’t make that up,” responded the “Love Island” star. “A friend of mine has a micro-penis.”\n\n“How small?” asked Morgan. “I mean, you were telling Margot Robbie.”\n\n“It’s small. I’d say an inch,” said Taylor.\n\n“Then you have a mate with very large testicles, is that right?” asked Morgan.\n\nTaylor laughed and replied, “My dad’s best mate has very big bullocks and he can carry 12 bottles of beer on it.”\n\n“And this is how you managed to get inside Margot Robbie’s head to end up playing Ken,” said Morgan.\n\n“I will say I panicked and I just said whatever came to my head,” Taylor said in justification of his bizarre conversation.\n\n“It was relevant,” Taylor continued. “like people were talking about penises.”\n\n“This is how you basically wooed Margot Robbie to get in the movie,” concluded Morgan. “Next thing, 18 months later, you are in Barbie.”\n\n“I am in Barbie,” said Taylor. “All because of micro-penises and big balls.”\n\nWatch the exchange around the nine-minute mark in the video above."

        "text": "The Barbenheimer craze is all over the pop culture world, and there is nothing stopping the hype. Being one of the most anticipated movies of the year, Barbie has impressed the audiences as well as the critics because of its Box Office collection and the acting performances of the star cast. Considering the pattern of the movie industry, after the success of the movie, many began to speculate about the future of the movie franchise and question whether there would be any spinoffs or sequels based on the character.\n\nThe Margot Robbie starrer gave a tough fight to Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer in terms of Box Office collection. Considering the so dar records, the live-action movie based on the pink doll has been ruling over the Cillian Murphy-led atomic epic movie. However, when asked about the future of the movies, here is what the doll’s parent company, Mattel executives, had to say. Read on to find out about it!\n\nDuring a recent conversation with Variety, Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz teased the company’s plans to create new stories in the live-action Barbie universe following the success of the Margot Robbie starrer movie. “Barbie, as a brand, has many different iterations,” he explained, adding about the main character having a lot of elements around in her universe. “It’s a very rich universe… It’s a very broad and very elastic brand in terms of opportunities,” said Kreiz.\n\nThe Mattel CEO believes successful movies lend themselves to more movies. “Our ambition is to create film franchises” he added. Reacting to the potential plans of expanding the universe, netizens were quick enough to grab the opportunity and share their reaction. Taking a dig at Oppenheimer, a user jokingly mentioned the dialogue from the movie and said, “I have become Barbie, endorser of capitalism”\n\n“I have become Barbie, endorser of capitalism” pic.twitter.com/26pSu4rIg0 — kip (@uorplefever) July 26, 2023\n\nNo one can miss the Fast and Furious movie franchise when talking about the sequels and prequels. Another took a dig and said, “Milk it like fast and the furious franchise”\n\nMilk it like fast and the furious franchise — ₿kush (@420bitcoins) July 26, 2023\n\n“Sadly it will also be acronymed as MCU,” well we did not noticed that!\n\nSadly it will also be acronymed as MCU 🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️ — CEM® (@ChadyMattar) July 27, 2023\n\nAnother added, “better than the marvel multiverse”\n\nMattel is looking to launch their own ‘Mattel Cinematic Universe’ following the success of #Barbie. pic.twitter.com/b5Vm0td8AY — Pop Base (@PopBase) July 26, 2023\n\nFollowing the early reactions to the movie, many appraised Ryan Gosling’s character and they even asked for him to get an Oscar nomination.

Her mates mostly work in the film industry too so they’re not fazed by Margot’s fame and she can just be herself.”\n\nAll her hard work has paid off though, as Barbie has received rave reviews around the world and has grossed more than £450million.\n\nMargot and Tom, who wed in 2016, formed their own production company, Lucky Chap, with some of their mates.\n\nSpeaking about it previously, she said: “We started our production company with our best friends and it continues to be a wonderful group dynamic.\n\n“We all really work well together. I feel very lucky.”\n\nROCHELLE SHARING IS A MARVEL\n\nROCHELLE Humes has revealed the secret to her rock-solid relationship with hubby Marvin – forward-planning.\n\nThe Saturdays singer wed JLS star Marvin 11 years ago and the couple have three kids.\n\nSpeaking to the Working Hard, Hardly Working podcast, she said: “I’m proud that we are so 50-50 in our relationship – every Sunday we sit down and work out the next week.\n\n“We share the school pick-up and in terms of our careers we give each other breathing space to shine.\n\n“If he wants to go on tour, I protect that period, and vice versa.\n\n“At the end of the day we have a family and that doesn’t stop for anybody.”\n\nTHERE have been murmurs of Cruz Beckham’s pop career for some time now.\n\nBut the teen looks ready to start crooning soon as he has now set up his own music firm under guidance of his mum Victoria’s brand guru.\n\n4 Cruz Beckham seems set to start up a pop career as he has now set up his own music firm Credit: Rex Features\n\nIn May, Cruz filed paperwork under That’s Not My Robot for “sound recording and music publishing activities” with his co-director listed as Oliver Shipton, who oversees VB’s brands.\n\nIt comes after he signed to Tap Music management, who also represent Ellie Goulding and Little Mix.\n\nZAK Abel reckons TikTok is the driving force behind the music industry nowadays.\n\nThe singer-songwriter, who performed at the King’s ­Coronation Concert at Windsor Castle in May, said the app allows fans to ­find lesser-known songs by artists that may otherwise go under the radar.\n\n4 Zak Edwards explained why he thinks TikTok is now the driving force of the music industry Credit: Arthur Edwards - News Group Newspapers Ltd\n\nZak, who releases his second album, Love Over Fear, in August told me: “I also think it opens up a door to songs that came out ten years ago, like that Miguel tune, then ­suddenly it has had a second wind.\n\n“Sometimes the record label doesn’t go with the song that you want to go with or it doesn’t quite smash it on the first try.\n\n“But with TikTok it allows every song to have its moment and people can find what they like and use it as a video soundtrack.”"

        "text": "Back during the early days of development on the Barbie movie, Amy Schumer was attached to play the titular role. As ideas for the movie kept evolving though, it transformed into something different from the initial concept, and the comedian bailed on the part. Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig ended up taking over the project, developing it into the pink, sparkly extravaganza that just hit theaters. Now, the I Feel Pretty star is reacting to the summer blockbuster in a tongue-in-cheek way that hints at her previous casting.\n\nAmy Schumer posted a goofy photo on her Instagram that shows her sporting a big sun hat. In her caption, she talked about seeing both Oppenheimer and Barbie this weekend, meaning she participated in the viral \"Barbenheimer\" double feature craze. Instead of suggesting she should have played the title character in the fantasy film, as originally intended, she joked that she actually should’ve been considered for another major role. You can see her hysterical post below:\n\nA post shared by @amyschumer A photo posted by on\n\nThis is an absolutely hilarious way of addressing her connection to Margot Robbie's movie. Instead of brushing aside Robbie, the Trainwreck star focuses on Oppenheimer, musing that she could've played Emily Blunt's Katherine \"Kitty\" Oppenheimer. That's obviously much funnier, considering she has zero connection to that movie. I’m honestly not sure she would've been right for the role of Blunt’s Kitty, as she suggests, but I love the shoutout for one of the most exciting movies of the summer.\n\nWhen Amy Schumer was attached to Barbie, the film was very different and in her words, not as “feminist and cool.” She left the project in 2017, and Robbie was cast in the titular role when Warner Brothers took over the project. With Robbie and Greta Gerwig as the feminine creative minds behind the project, it seemingly received a fresh creative jolt. Schumer was previously asked if she was looking forward to the new iteration of the film that hit theaters. At the time, the actress was enthusiastic, about the project, so it seems evident that there's not kind of bad blood in the mix here.\n\nThe Last Comic Standing alum continues to show she's one of the wittiest comedic minds in the entertainment industry. She always seems able to put a funny spin on a potentially awkward situation, and she did so with such class using this post. It’s hilarious and subtle while encouraging others to see the two wonderful films that just so happen to be in theaters at the same time. Also, she's totally rocking that sun hat, so maybe Christopher Nolan should keep the comedy star in mind he needs to cast another protagonist that sports a sweet lid.\n\nYou can catch both Barbie and Oppenheimer in theaters now just like Amy Schumer did. Fans of the Snatched actress should check out her latest project, Life & Beth, which is streaming now with a Hulu subscription. And for more insight on other films hitting cinemas and streaming this year, make sure to consult our 2023 movie release schedule."

        "text": "The rise of “Barbie” continues in our Oscar odds. As of this writing the blockbuster film’s star, Margot Robbie, has ascended into the top five for Best Actress, according to the Expert journalists we’ve surveyed from major media outlets. If they’re right this will be her third career nomination.\n\nOn July 24, at which point “Barbie” was already a box office phenom, Experts ranked Robbie ninth in the Best Actress race. By July 26 she had risen to seventh place. On July 30 she moved up to sixth place. And finally on August 1 she slipped past Natalie Portman (“May December”) to take over fifth position. She still trails front-runner Fantasia Barrino (“The Color Purple”) as well as likely nominees Greta Lee (“Past Lives”), Sandra Huller (“Anatomy of a Fall“), and Annette Bening (“Nyad”).\n\nIt would be unusual for an actor to be nominated for a character based on a doll, but Robbie has thoroughly proved her mettle with a previous Best Actress nom for “I, Tonya” (a film she also produced) and a Best Supporting Actress bid for “Bombshell.” And her performance in “Barbie” has been described by critics as “pitch-perfect” and “irresistible.” She “nimbly handles the comedic rhythm of these worlds.” And as with “I, Tonya,” Robbie is also a producer here, which might win her extra points from academy members impressed by her creative achievements in front of and behind the camera.\n\nOf course, it bears repeating that this awards season still has a long, long way to go, and we can’t be entirely sure that the current WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes won’t stretch that season even longer. As it stands, we have yet to see other Best Actress hopefuls like Regina King in “Shirley,” Jessica Lange in “Long Day’s Journey Into Night,” and the aforementioned Barrino and Bening. So will Robbie keep rising higher, or will this year’s field of contenders eventually crowd her out?\n\nPREDICTthe 2024 Oscar nominations\n\nMake your predictions at Gold Derby now.

        "text": "I saw “Barbie” the day after it premiered. You probably do not need another “Barbie” take after nearly every pundit in America has already taken a whack, but I am still thinking about the movie nearly a month later. In particular, I continue to marvel at the performance of Margot Robbie, who played the titular heroine — Stereotypical Barbie — and who I think isn’t getting enough credit for holding the movie together.\n\nFor the three of you who haven’t seen the movie yet, here’s a rough outline of the plot: Stereotypical Barbie has an existential crisis in women-run Barbie Land when her body becomes less than flawless — a spot of cellulite here, an unarched foot there. She must journey to the real world, leaving an army of other Barbies behind, to get back to a state of unquestioning bliss. She grudgingly takes Ken (a perfectly doltish Ryan Gosling) with her, and in the real world he discovers the concept of patriarchy. Ken returns to Barbie Land before her and stages a coup, overthrowing the matriarchy and installing a band of “doofi” in their place. Some dance battles, terrible crooning and rousing feminist speeches ensue, and ultimately, Barbie triumphs (how could she not?), while also choosing beautifully messy reality over plastic perfection.\n\nDespite the pro-Barbie message, I had the same reaction as The Times’s chief film critic, Manohla Dargis, who praised Robbie’s performance as “charming and subtly phased,” while acknowledging that she is upstaged by Ken’s “comic obtuseness and arc.” (My 7-year-old daughter still wants Ken’s Mojo Dojo Casa House.) At first, when I left the theater, it irked me that Robbie and her band of Barbies — with the possible exception of exiled Weird Barbie, who doesn’t fit the mold (Kate McKinnon) — didn’t get to have as much fun as any of the Kens or Allan (a hilariously disgruntled Michael Cera, who plays the only male doll not named Ken). A movie called “Barbie,” and Barbie didn’t always feel like the main character.\n\nBut after reflection, I wondered if that was an intentional commentary on what it means to be a woman — doing the necessary and unsung labor of plot exposition while the men in the film get to be Mr. Fun Dad. I also kept thinking about Robbie as Stereotypical Barbie. Her movements were always precise and embodied — it’s not easy to play plastic. But crucially, it was quietly moving to watch the dawning realization of mortality, human cruelty and prejudice register on her luminous face."

She said her team originally toyed with the idea of Robbie, Ryan Gosling, and other cast members wearing makeup that made them look artificial.\n\n\"We thought, 'Should they have plastic seams? Should they have plastic skin, plastic hair?'\" she told the publication. \"We didn't like all of those things in the end because Barbies are beautiful in every child's mind. So once we created that fake image, it wasn't beautiful.\"\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nInstead, Primorac made the cast look like picture-perfect versions of their human selves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There's a high finish to everything,\" she said. \"So the hair is bigger and the skin is more luminous.\"\n\nRobbie, in particular, had countless makeup options, all of which helped her get into character.\n\n\"Margot would choose her lipstick and blush according to what costume she wore.

The actress, known for her roles in The Wolf of Wall Street, Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood and Suicide Squad, may be associated with the all-pink Dreamhouse currently, but she has renovated some impressive properties of her own in Venice and Los Angeles, California, and her signature style couldn't be more different.\n\nAs the highest-paid actress of 2022, Australian-born Margot spends the majority of her time living and working in Los Angeles. Since marrying her husband Tom Ackerley in 2017, she has acquired and renovated three homes, playing on the modern beach house décor that California is known for.\n\nWe take a look at her property portfolio.\n\nMargot's former Californian home – purchased in 2017\n\n(Image credit: Engel & Völkers Beverly Hills / Paul Barnaby)\n\nIn 2017, Margot Robbie and Tom Ackerley bought their first property together in Hancock Park, one of the wealthiest districts in LA. The couple purchased the property the year I, Tonya came to cinemas, a role which won Robbie an Oscar nomination.\n\nMargot Robbie's chic So-Cal home is characterized by its perfect garden spaces and white wood panelling – and that's just the exterior.\n\nThis 3,300 square foot property was built in 2016, and sits on 0.15 acres of land. The house's high ceilings and oak hardwood floors contribute to the splendor and openness of this property which incorporates West Coastal and New England aesthetics. The house has four bedrooms and six bathrooms.\n\n(Image credit: Engel & Völkers Beverly Hills / Paul Barnaby)\n\nThe property includes a number of stand out features, including French doors, ocean views from the primary suite's balcony, a wine cellar, fireplace and a Carrera marble kitchen counter. The backyard contains a pool, bar and cabana.\n\nThis property is not only architecturally stunning, but also exudes charisma with design that isn't taken too seriously, evident by the living room's indoor swing, round sofa and pet room with a separate entry door to the property, which was likely enjoyed by the puppy they adopted earlier that year.\n\n(Image credit: Engel & Völkers Beverly Hills / Paul Barnaby)\n\nPut simply, this home is manicured perfection, with its open concept, bright, beachy vibe, it's easy to see why the actress fell in love with it. It's safe to say this property lives up in its grandeur to Barbie's Malibu Dreamhouse.\n\nThe house listed in June 2021 for $3.4 million.\n\n(Image credit: Engel & Völkers Beverly Hills / Paul Barnaby)\n\nMargot Robbie's former Bungalow – purchased in 2018\n\nThe same year Margot Robbie starred as Mary Queen of Scots, she purchased a bungalow in Hollywood Heights to renovate. She is said to have bought the two bed, one bathroom property from Dustin Lance, the writer of Milk, for $950,000.\n\nThe bungalow, built in 1951, is 945 square foot, making it a manageable project for the star to renovate between and during filming. This included refinishing the hardwood floors, renovating the kitchen and painting throughout. The exterior of the house is painted white with blue accent shutters, banister and doors. The house also has blue window covers, and plant beds on various levels, and in the back of the property there is a tiered yard.\n\nThe primary bedroom is close to nature, with French doors leading onto a small courtyard. The living room also has French doors, creating a light and airy flow throughout the property. The highest level of the terrace captures plenty of natural light and is surrounded by plants, creating a peaceful spot for drinks and sunbathing. This spot also has views of the canyon behind the property.\n\nMargot is said to have sold the house in 2021 for $1.2 million, after renting it out for three years.\n\nMargot Robbie's current Venice beach house – purchased in 2019\n\nIn 2019, Robbie invested in an edgy Venice Beach compound (see above) which she bought for $5 million in an off-market deal. This Los Angeles property is made up of three separate concrete structures on a double-wide lot, including a loft space which includes a kitchen and office space, a second separate structure, which is a two-bed bungalow and, thirdly, a cottage.\n\nAlthough from the outside the concrete property appears uninviting, with only two windows above the three-car garage, the inside of the property is quite the opposite, and ensures utter privacy. With plenty of natural light, white walls, high exposed wood ceilings and light wooden flooring, it captures the Venice Beach lifestyle.\n\nThe property is strikingly modern, repeating the concrete and silver metal theme throughout and in the yard, and which is harmoniously balanced by the wooden furniture and doors that enhance the natural elements of the home.\n\nWith the stunning modern interiors of the house, fans were delighted when Margot Robbie gave viewers a peek into the property during a Vogue 73 Questions video series.\n\nThis revealed some stand-out features, such as a barn door and an outdoor decking area with a long dining table, surrounded by plants and enclosed by other parts of the property.\n\nMargot Robbie grew up on a farm on Australia's Gold Coast which appears to be where some of her interior style has rooted from.\n\nThe house features a lap pool which Margot told Vogue she loves to start her day swimming in. The separate living spaces mean outdoor space is integrated into the home, ensuring plenty of natural light is introduced into the living spaces, which is furthered by the large windows and French doors.\n\nIn 2021, it was reported by TMZ that Margot had donned her renovator hat again, putting the house under major construction work. When completed, this will reportedly up the property's worth to over $15 million.\n\nKnowing Margot and Tom's love for beachy interiors, possibly influenced by her Australian roots, we're excited to see how this property turns out."

        "text": "There’s a moment in “Barbie” where Ryan Gosling, who plays the wickedly funny and insecure manchild, Ken, steps off the screen and yells, “Sublime!” It might be the most extraordinary Oscar-worthy clip of a person not to be seen on screen.\n\n“Barbie,” the new meta-comedy from Warner Bros, which also acts as an infomercial for Mattel, finally lands for audiences and could be one of the leading comedy films seeking Oscar recognition by year’s end if Academy members can take it seriously. Gosling’s iconic turn, at least, is worthy of best supporting actor recognition.\n\nCommercial comedies, particularly those without the added “dramedy” sub-qualifier, have faced difficulty landing Academy recognition for decades (i.e., Vince Vaughn in “Wedding Crashers”). However, a promising trend has been seen in the last few years with acting nominees like Robert Downey Jr in “Tropic Thunder” (2008), Melissa McCarthy in “Bridesmaids” (2011) and Maria Bakalova in “Borat Subsequent Moviefilm” (2020) landing comfortably in their respective fields. Gosling could join the ranks.\n\nGosling, 42, is a respected actor in the industry with two nominations under his belt — one as the drug-addicted teacher in “Half Nelson” (2006) and the other as the passionate jazz player in “La La Land” (2016). He may not be the first name you think of when discussing brilliant comedic actors, but he’s displayed his funny chops in films such as Shane Black’s “The Nice Guys” (2016) opposite Russell Crowe. With abs and a fur coat, Gosling is the film’s MVP.\n\nWhen it comes to the film’s overall chances, it will all rest on sustainability through the season. While the reviews are strong (sitting at 89% on Rotten Tomatoes), it’ll need to show strength through significant guild recognition through the season, such as WGA and PGA, to have any chance of being one of the few populist movies that land in the best picture lineup.\n\nEverett Collection\n\nAs the titular character, Margot Robbie is undoubtedly tailor-made for the role she was born to play. With a career that has already landed the Australian performer two Oscar noms herself — “I, Tonya” (2017) and “Bombshell” (2019) — she’ll be a fan favorite throughout the remaining calendar year. However, outside of being a solid contender for a Golden Globe in lead comedy actress, an Oscar slot in best actress might be challenging to attain (she’s also a listed producer, which could help in the best picture). The same goes for America Ferrera, who is wonderful as Gloria, delivering an inspirational speech about women’s roles worldwide that will be used in acting classroom monologues for years. Ferrera also has Sony’s “Dumb Money,” which could put her on Oscar’s radar.\n\nGerwig’s skillful commentary on feminism and biting humor could create an opportunity for her to land recognition in adapted screenplay. With three previous noms for “Lady Bird” (2017) in directing and original screenplay and “Little Women” (2019) in adapted, she’s a well-regarded scribe and could land, along with her real-life partner Noah Baumbach, in the race.\n\nWhat’s most needed in the “Barbie” best picture quest is the recognition of its artisans. Production design (Sarah Greenwood, Katie Spencer) and costumes (Jacqueline Durran) seem like no-brainers no matter the outcome of the rest of the year. But can it add editing by Nick Huoy, an original score mention by Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt, or an original song for Billie Eilish and Finneas (“What Was I Made For”)? Those answers will be vital to its chances.\n\nThe “Barbenheimer” frenzy has linked the two titles in audiences’ minds. Interestingly, with “Oppenheimer” feeling assured of a run for best picture run, that could weirdly help “Barbie” get on those same ballots (as long as the campaigns remain as friendly as they’ve been the past few weeks).\n\nCheck out the latest Oscar predictions on Variety Awards Circuit."

When you go to see this amazing film please don’t blink.”\n\nWhile some still questioned whether he was joking, Brydon does make a cameo appearance during a scene at the house of “weird” Barbie, played by Kate McKinnon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobbie, who plays the lead role and serves as a producer, said she wanted to give Brydon a role because she’s a “huge fan” of BBC series Gavin & Stacey.\n\nHad a great time at the Barbie premiere celebrating my pivotal role as Sugar Daddy Ken. When you go to see this amazing film please don't blink 😊 pic.twitter.com/osFeuRbf3L — Rob Brydon (@RobBrydon) July 13, 2023\n\nSpeaking to Cosmopolitan UK, Robbie said: “I’m a huge fan of Gavin & Stacey so Rob Brydon being in it was an enormous priority for me.”\n\nAt the film’s premiere, Brydon told Virgin Radio UK why he believes he landed a role in the Hollywood film. “I had a message a few years ago that Margot Robbie was a big fan of Uncle Bryn and would I record a message for her birthday,” he said.\n\n“So I recorded a video for her. I think maybe this part is her way of saying thank you.\n\n“I said ‘Hello Margot. I’ve loved you in all your films and I’ll tell you for why…’ So when I met her on the set, she said, ‘Ah, thank you so much for that message…’ So that was quite nice.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrydon played Uncle Bryn in Gavin & Stacey across the show’s three seasons and its two Christmas specials in 2008 and 2019.\n\nAlongside Robbie, Barbie stars Ryan Gosling, America Ferrera, Michael Cera, Ariana Greenblatt, Simu Liu, Issa Rae, Rhea Perlman, Helen Mirren and Will Ferrell.\n\nIn a four-star review, NME wrote: “What follows is a nuanced, rose-tinted comedy adventure, set to a stonking pop soundtrack featuring Lizzo and Billie Eilish, that somehow lives up to the immense hype. To borrow a pun from Ken’s coolest jacket (out of a long lineup), Barbie is more than ‘kenough’.”"

        "text": "As the world progresses towards a more inclusive future, several successful individuals have proved that physical disabilities cannot hinder their dreams and aspirations. Coming out in support of those with hearing impairments, celebrities who know sign language have used the skill on many occasions to spread some love.\n\nFrom acting to literature, music, television, sports and more, famous deaf people have become icons not just due to their success but because they continue to inspire people with their journey. History bears witness to numerous such heroes — Helen Keller, one of the most prominent names in relation to American Sign Language (ASL), was the first deaf-blind person to graduate from college in 1904 and authored several books. William “Dummy” Hoy was a prominent deaf Major League Baseball player, credited with inventing hand signals, which players use even today.\n\nWhile stories of well-known deaf celebrities are inspiring, hearing stars who have learned sign language to connect with admirers also deserve special mention.\n\nToday, 41 countries recognise multiple sign languages, many of which cater to various language diction and dialects. For instance, despite both the UK and the USA being English-speaking countries, British sign language (BSL) is very different from ASL.\n\nFamous personalities who can communicate in sign language\n\nMargot Robbie\n\nBarbie (2023) star Margot Robbie has time and again wowed her audiences with her diverse set of roles. From starring as Harley Quinn in The Suicide Squad (2021) to playing Tonya Harding in I, Tonya (2017), Robbie has proved her brilliant acting prowess.\n\nIn 2023, she won over her fans with another hidden talent of hers. A video clip from the premiere of Amsterdam (2022) went viral on X, formerly known as Twitter, where the actress showed her sign language skills. While signing autographs for fans, she noticed a person gesturing. The actress immediately handed her stuff to her handlers and went over to converse with the deaf fan. The video captures Robbie saying “I know it” and gesturing what appears to be “Nice to meet you.” Hawk-eyed viewers also noticed that it wasn’t American Sign Language.\n\nThough not entirely fluent, the Academy Award-nominated star showed she knew the sign alphabet and later posed for a photograph with the fan. This comes as quite a surprise as Robbie has never spoken about knowing sign language before.\n\nV of BTS\n\nKim Taehyung, better known as V from the globally renowned Korean-pop group BTS, has won over the internet several times for supporting the deaf community. During his speech at the “Class of 2020” initiative by YouTube, for those who graduated amid the pandemic, V congratulated the batch and used American Sign Language to gesture applause. This was a big win for those with hearing loss.\n\nTaehyung using the ‘clapping’ in sign language at every chance he gets, is the sweetest thing ever- 🥺\n\npic.twitter.com/05RyGHXqTU — koshy⁷ 🍓 (@taeskoshy) May 24, 2021\n\nIn another instance, V gestured “Butter” in an image the band put up on Weverse while promoting their 2021 album and the hit song. In 2020, he signed “together” as a mark of solidarity among ARMY, during the BangBangCon The Live online concert.\n\nTaehyung used the sign language for “Together” during the Eye contact part in today’s concert. His ways of showing love for Armys is always so unique. He is the most thoughtful human in this world. 💜#BANGBANGCON_TheLive @BTS_twt pic.twitter.com/uy2wEAchKO — KTH FACTS (@KTH_Facts) June 14, 2020\n\nHe also took to sign language to gesture “I love you” in one of his birthday lives to show gratitude and love for deaf people who have supported him and BTS.\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAn advocate for the LGBTQ+ community, a fashion icon, a three-time Grammy winner and a former One Direction member, Harry Styles needs no introduction when it comes to creating heart-touching music and outstanding live concerts.\n\nWhile fans may know about his acting talents, many may not be aware that the “Watermelon Sugar” crooner also knows to use American Sign Language adeptly. At the 2023 Grammy Awards, Styles won the Album of The Year and Best Pop Vocal Album for Harry’s House. While addressing the press backstage, he was joined by an ASL interpreter. At the end of the conversation, Styles gestured “thank you” to her and earned enormous praise for knowing the sign language.\n\nHarry Styles thanked the interpreter in sign language ☺️pic.twitter.com/OlmZeuXxGy — HS (@thehrrycore) February 7, 2023\n\nIt came as a surprise for fans who didn’t know about this talent. However, a 2020 Marie Claire report states the “As It Was” hitmaker had shared with BBC Radio 1Xtra that he was making the most of the quarantine period. He said he was “learning Italian and doing some sign language classes”.\n\nJeon So-min\n\nPopular Korean actress Jeon So-min is among those celebrities who know sign language to make their fans with hearing loss feel included and loved.\n\nIn one instance, at a fan event in Anyang in 2019, a deaf fan approached her to gift a portrait drawn by him. When she learnt the person was hard of hearing, she immediately expressed her gratitude by gesturing “thank you” and “I love you” using sign language. The video won over the internet as fans poured their love for the heartfelt gesture.\n\nAmitabh Bachchan\n\nNext on the list of celebrities who know sign language is from the Indian film fraternity, Amitabh Bachchan, also known as Big B. In 2005, he starred in Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Black along with Rani Mukerji. The film narrates the cathartic journey of Michelle McNally (Mukerji) who is a mute, blind and deaf person. Debraj Sahai (Bachchan) arrives as her teacher and a beacon of light in her dark life.\n\nAs part of their preparation for the challenging roles, both Bachchan and Mukerji spent months learning sign language from the Helen Keller Institute for Deaf & Deafblind, said a News18 report. He also took Braille lessons and watched numerous documentaries. The film earned him a National Award and Filmfare Award, among other accolades.\n\nIn 2022, Bachchan sent a strong message on Indian Independence Day when he performed the national anthem with disabled children using sign language.\n\nRiz Ahmed\n\nActor Riz Ahmed is another celebrity who learned American Sign Language for a role. In Sound of Metal (2019), he appeared as Ruben Stone, a metallic drummer who sufferers rapid hearing loss while on tour. Succumbed to his fate, Ruben joins a deaf community to cope with his silent life.\n\nAhmed took sign language lessons from ASL coach Jeremy Lee Stone to get a deeper understanding of its workings and how the community feels at large. The actor found the entire experience to be quite enriching and felt the story was something that needed to be told.\n\nReflecting on learning ASL he told Variety, “Jeremy told me that communicating in ASL is different than communicating in English because it was more emotional. You’re listening with your whole body and you’re communicating with your whole body.”\n\nAlexander Skarsgård\n\nAlexander Skarsgård came out in support of his Godzilla vs. Kong (2021) co-star Kaylee Hottle, who portrayed a deaf character, during the filming process. When Skarsgård realised he was sharing the screen with her and needed to communicate, the actor learnt ASL to make her feel more comfortable.\n\nAccording to People, the deaf actress was raised in an all-deaf family and was only nine years old when she bagged the role. Complimenting her role and ease on the set, Skarsgård told Junkee, “It’s her first movie. It’s fascinating how comfortable she is in front of the camera and how quickly she takes notes from the director Adam [Wingard].”\n\n(Hero image: Courtesy V/ @thv/ Instagram;Amitabh Bachchan/ Instagram; Feature image: Courtesy V/ @thv/ Instagram)"

        "text": "Considering she's been a runway and fashion magazine cover regular for over 12 years, there are few people more qualified to tell you what to wear and how to wear it than model and actor Cara Delevingne.\n\nHowever, that's not the stance she takes on the subject. The 30-year-old ELLE UK September issue cover star, who made her catwalk debut in Burberry's AW11 show, is of the opinion that everyone should be able to govern their own style.\n\nPlaying a game of 'It's A Mood' with the magazine, charting her most iconic looks over the years, she confesses that her 'number one style rule' of all time, is this: 'If you feel good in it, it doesn't matter what anyone else says. Because as long as you feel good in it, that is the point of clothing. Sc**w everyone else, they don't know about fashion, because no-one does.'\n\n'Except ELLE UK,' she quickly caveats, a wry smile on her face.\n\nDiving into her archive to look at a picture of Delevingne and Margot Robbie attending Glastonbury music festival in June 2017, she gives us the secret to her relaxed outfit - making her own denim cut-offs out of vintage blue jeans - and reveals a favourite memory from that summer:\n\n'My favourite memory from attending Glastonbury. When we were lining up to use the bathroom - usually at Glastonbury it's a really long line - and when we were lining up, while we were standing there a man in a caterpillar outfit crawled along the floor and went under the door, because they are like stalls... and then out of the stall emerged this same guy as a butterfly. Everyone was screaming and so happy.'\n\nRecalling the 2023 Met Gala in honour of late fashion designer and industry behemoth Karl Lagerfeld, Delevingne insists that the tribute was, 'Beautiful... There was a lot of crazy sprinkled in there, but it was beautiful.'\n\nAnd thinking back to whose outfit she was most impressed with on the night, she reveals that it was Lil Nas:\n\n'In real life, it was just the bejewelledness. My gosh, that's a lot of effort. I was sitting down for a long time, but that's a lot of effort. His butt always looks so good. Those tight, tight pants.'\n\nOn the flavour of androgyny and genderless dressing that she often likes to bring to the table, she thinks back to the tuxedo look she wore to the wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank in 2018:\n\n'I wanted to mix the feminine and masculine element. I felt dashing, super cool. I wanted a walking stick... a cane. But that would have been too much, too Fred Astaire.\n\nAnd thinking more broadly about weddings in general, the Carnival Row star shared:\n\n'I love a small wedding, I love a destination wedding. They're all beautiful, They're all fun. I don't think I've ever not had a good time at a wedding.'\n\nOn being shown a picture of herself as a much younger girl, in a canary yellow, pouffy dress, she reminisces about her childhood: 'At that age, and I still do love dancing. Out on the dancefloor, throwing myself around all crazy.\n\n'I think when I was younger I had more fun [with fashion]. Now, I feel more pressure with it. I wish I didn't. I think I didn't care as much, but somehow when I cared less, I seemed to be more stylish. But now, I'm like \"this just doesn't go...\" But I wear the same thing all the time.'\n\nA lesson to leave us with for sure...\n\nWatch Cara Delevingne play 'Its A Mood' with ELLE UK in the video at the top of this article.

Margot and Tom tied the knot in 2016 in a small wedding in Australia's Byron Bay, which was reportedly attended by just 50 guests. The Wolf of Wall Street star, who also previously starred on Neighbours, is believed to have worn an Oscar de la Renta dress as she was walked up the aisle by her mother, Sarie Kessler. It's understood that Margot is estranged from her father Doug, who reportedly left the family when she was very young.\n\nImage: Getty Images) Getty Images)\n\nSpeaking about her romance with Tom back in 2016 to Vogue, Margot admitted that she'd always had an aversion to longterm relationships. \"Then this crept up on me,\" she explained. \"We were friends for so long. I was always in love with him, but I thought, Oh, he would never love me back. Don't make it weird, Margot. Don't be stupid and tell him that you like him. And then it happened, and I was like, 'Of course we're together.'

        "text": "Margot Robbie is known as one of the most beautiful, successful women in Hollywood, but she's really a family-oriented person who absolutely loves being married. Her life took a fascinating turn when she fell in love with Tom Ackerley, a British film producer. In a 2016 Vogue interview, she reminisced about her initial reluctance towards relationships until she realized her long-standing feelings for her then-friend, Ackerley. The two had a serendipitous meeting in 2013 during the filming of the WWII-era romance Suite Française. Their friendship transformed into a relationship, which they initially kept hidden to avoid complicating their shared living situation in London. But ever since they got together, Robbie says her life has transformed for the better.\n\nMargot Robbie Says Life Got Way Better after She Met Her Husband\n\nRobbie and Ackerley's professional and personal lives became more intertwined when they co-founded a production company, LuckyChap Entertainment, with friends Josey McNamara and Sophia Kerr. It was this venture that led them to pick up the much-anticipated Barbie movie project. Margot took a hands-on approach, bringing in Greta Gerwig to pen the script. Both Robbie and Ackerley were taken aback by the brilliance of the script, which later translated to a whopping $774.5 billion in global box office earnings.\n\nLuckyChap's success prompted Robbie and Ackerley's relocation to Los Angeles in 2016. That same year, the couple got married in Australia. Their nuptials were private and they kept most of it off social media. But they have remained happily married since. They don't have children yet, but they have a special love for traveling. After wrapping up Barbie, they traveled from London to Venice and later explored Japan. Throughout these journeys, Robbie expressed her dream of \"living on a train.\" Additionally, the actress humorously mentioned her aversion to cooking, leaving that task to the men in her life, while she and her female friends excel at enjoying drinks.\n\n\"I'm a great advocate of doing business with your partner,\" she said in a Porter interview in 2018. \"Being married is actually the most fun ever, life got way more fun somehow. I have a responsibility being someone's wife, I want to be better.\"\n\nShe has also said that they remain best friends, and they have a strict rule: they don't spend more than three weeks apart from each other. And if they do have to be travel alone, they talk on the phone all the time. Robbie says that, even though Ackerley is behind the camera, he's a loud and outgoing person who loves to talk to everyone.\n\nAlthough Robbie is largely private about her marriage, it's clear that she is head over heels for Ackerley and much of her success wouldn't be possible without him. This couple joins the ranks of some of the cutest duos in Hollywood, like Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher, Chris Pratt and Katherine Schwarzenegger, and Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds. Many people are waiting for Robbie and Ackerley to have children, but she has made it clear that she isn't in any rush. Still, their kids would be the absolute cutest, so her fans are waiting patiently.\n\nEvie deserves to be heard. Support our cause and help women reclaim their femininity by subscribing today."

        "text": "Saltburn is produced by Margot Robbie, who is currently making waves in Hollywood with her latest film, Barbie. Robbie is co-producing Saltburn with Emerald Fennell. It's all about a British upmarket mystery thriller starring Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, and Rosamund Pike. Meanwhile, Emerald Fennell even appears in the latter as the pregnant Barbie, Midge. So, if you like Promising Young Woman and the other films Margot Robbie has produced and are looking forward to Saltburn, here is everything we know so far.\n\nALSO READ: Barbie: Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling starrer coming to THESE OTT platforms; Here's where you can stream\n\nWhat is Saltburn all about?\n\nSaltburn, which takes place in the mid-2000s, has been characterized as a wicked narrative of luxury and desire that examines England's aristocratic upper society in a dark and captivating drama of infatuation with a soundtrack of early 21st century pop bangers.\n\nSpecific narrative aspects have been kept under wraps since the film is billed as a mystery in which we learn things alongside the characters; therefore, it's wise not to go too deeply into the storyline. But we do know that Barry Keoghan portrays Oliver Quick, an Oxford undergraduate who, unable to form his own clique, falls in love with Felix Catton, portrayed by Jacod Elordi. Felix invites Oliver to his aristocratic family home, Saltburn, for a memorable summer with his quirky family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Fennell is well qualified to convey a narrative like this because the film is likely based on her real-life experiences. Fennell's father, British jeweler Theo Fennell, is an opulent figure in British high society, and she herself attended the most expensive private school in the UK. She even notably played Queen consort Camila Shand in Netflix's The Crown's third season.\n\nWhat is the cast and release date of Saltburn?\n\nSaltburn has been selected for the coveted opening slot of the BFI London Film Festival and will make its debut on October 4, 2023, as part of the festival's 67th edition. MGM will release the picture in the United States. However, it will only be available in limited theaters during Thanksgiving weekend, November 24. It will later be released globally over the following weekend.\n\nSaltburn is scheduled to have a theater run late into the holiday season, right up to Christmas, as Fennell's Promising Young Woman did during the 2021 epidemic and was one of the few movies to have something resembling a successful theatrical run. However, because MGM [owned by Amazon Studios] is releasing the picture, it might be accessible on Prime Video in time for the Academy Awards.\n\nSaltburn has an exceptional star cast, as Barry Keoghan and Jacob Elordi lead an amazing ensemble cast in Saltburn. Keoghan is fresh off his first Academy Award nomination for his role as the charming local dimwit Dominic in The Banshees of Inisherin, and the Irish actor known for his roles in hit films like Eternals and The Batman will aim to get his second mention. Meanwhile, Elordi also has a busy year ahead of him since he will play Elvis Presley in Sofia Coppola's highly anticipated biopic Priscilla.\n\nALSO READ: Barbie: Margot Robbie finally breaks her silence on Internet's fascination with her feet; Here's what she said"

After Juhi Parmar and Jay Bhanushali, Bollywood actress Lisa Ray has slammed the film as well as people who are celebrating it.\n\nLisa Ray slams Margot Robbie's Barbie\n\nTaking to Twitter, Lisa Ray questioned 'woke millennials and Gen Zers' for appreciating the Margot Robbie-led film. \"How are you not only not up in arms over the Barbie movie - which is really a huge marketing push for an agent of female oppression cloaked as a movie - but many of you are also participating in Barbiecore and posting cute photos in hot pink,\" she tweeted.\n\nThe actress further called out young influencers for celebrating a movie that brings unwelcome Barbie standards and its legacy to the next generation of girls. \"I can only think that marketing budgets got to them. Please enlighten,\" she further added.\n\nLisa is not the only one to call out the film! Prior to her, Juhi Parmar, Jay Bhanushali, Mira Kapoor and Sona Mohapatra had expressed their disappointment with the Greta Gerwig film.\n\nAbout Barbie\n\nDirected by Greta Gerwig, Barbie is the first live-action Barbie film! Starring Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, the film follows the duo on a journey of self-discovery after their expulsion from the utopian Barbie Land. America Ferrera, Kate McKinnon, Michael Cera, Ariana Greenblatt, Issa Rae, Rhea Perlman, Helen Mirren and Will Ferrell also play pivotal roles in the film.

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nBarbie fans are complaining about a line that’s being branded the “worst” in the film.\n\nThe blockbuster, which is set to make $1bn at the global box office this week, was released earlier this month to acclaim from critics and audiences. The Independent gave the film five stars, calling it “a near-miraculous achievement”.\n\nDirector Greta Gerwig co-wrote the film with her husband, director Noah Baumbach, with producer Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling playing the lead roles.\n\nThe film has many laugh-out-loud moments, many of which involve Gosling’s performance as Ken, but one joke involving Barbie left a bad taste in the mouths of many audience members.\n\nIt arrives when Barbie is having an existential crisis upon her return to Barbieland, where she discovers it’s been taken over by the Kens.\n\nWhile at the house of “weird” Barbie (Kate McKinnon), she emotionally tells human charcater Gloria (America Ferrera): “I’m not pretty anymore. I’m not ‘stereotypical Barbie’ pretty.”\n\nHere, the narrator (Helen Mirren) can be heard saying: “Note to the filmmakers: Margot Robbie is the wrong person to cast if you want to make this point.”\n\nIt seems this joke failed to impress many, who otherwise enjoyed the film, but are expressing their frustrations with the quip on social media. They’re making their views known following a response to a post by @PopBase, asking: “What was your favourite part of #Barbie?”, in which one fan namechecked this narration highlighting Robbie’s looks.\n\n“I actually hated that and it made the scene less impactful to me,” one person wrote in disagreement, with another adding: “Literally THE worst moment in the film. horrifically unfunny and pathetically self-apologetic. self-awareness doesn’t make the choice any better.”\n\nAn additional viewer waded in: “This was the only part of the movie I would have changed actually. Just because someone is gorgeous doesn’t mean they can’t FEEL unpretty.”\n\nHowever, some argued that the scene was effective as Mirren’s narration was the precise thought that came into their head just before the line was spoken.\n\n“It was literally perfect because that’s EXACTLY what I was telling myself,” one person replied, calling it “genius”.\n\nBarbie is in cinemas now."

        "text": "The live action Barbie movie has definitely restored the summer box office to the (Barbie) pink of its health. Having already earned more than 300 million dollars, the film is slated to become one of the highest earners in Hollywood history. While the success of this fantasy comedy is superficially attributed to its ensemble cast and its impeccable direction, there is so much more to its appeal.\n\nHere goes a list of things that the filmmakers did phenomenally well to make Barbie an endearing and enthralling watch for generations to come.\n\n1) The Album\n\nProduced by Mark Ronson, the soundtrack of the Margot Robbie starrer is full of songs that convey profound emotions in a barbie-esque fashion but still manage to be extremely visceral in their depiction of our quotidian struggles as human beings. With songs ranging from the groovy 'WATATI' sung by Karol G and Aldo Ranks to the highly relatable ' What Was I ​Made For' by Billie Eilish, the Barbie album has something for everyone.\n\nImpressively enough, the line-up of the artists is quite diverse too, and it is certain that listeners across all age groups will be able to find a new favorite from the track list.\n\n2) Strategic Brand Collaborations\n\nFrom Airbnb to Burger King, from Aldo to Dragon Glassware, the list of brands that have doused their commodities and services in shades of pink popularised only by Barbie does not seem to end. These astute promotional tie-ups not only gave the movie unparalleled visibility but also ensured great profits for the companies that hopped onto the bandwagon.\n\nIt is not an exaggeration to say that the greatest blockbuster this year is not the live action Barbie movie itself but its marketing team. Special mention to 'Barbeinheimer' memes, Ryan Gosling's GQ interview titled 'Ken Things Ryan Gosling Can't Live Without' and the Barbie dreamhouse tour by none other than the on-screen Barbie, Margot Robbie herself.\n\n​​​​​​3) The Iconic Costumes\n\n​​​​​The costume department headed by the Academy- award winning designer, Jacqueline Durran, took inspiration from Barbie's outfits over the years to replicate the same looks in the film. This gave the whole movie a nostalgic undertone and was highly instrumental in heightening its allure. Be it the evergreen stripped swimsuit from the 1950s or the skater look from the 1990s, the outfits donned by Margot Robbie in the movie will be remembered for ages to come due to the keen attention to detail that went into making them.\n\n4) The Diverse Movie Cast\n\nThe film has garnered appreciation for including actors like Simu Liu (as Ken #2) and ​​​Ritu Arya(as journalist Barbie) as they come from communities that are not showcased enough on-screen . The cast also features Ncuti Gatwa, America Ferrera and Issa Rae alongside other notable actors. Their roles in the movie are seen as stepping stones to better representation of minorities in the mainstream media.\n\n​​​​​​5) Saying it Right\n\n​​​​ Movies with a message, especially ones with a feminist subtext, can be considered \"preachy\" if not done right. Barbie breaks all barriers though and deftly makes pertinent and nuanced points about the subjugation of women, belongingness and loss of innocence. The film does not turn into a sermon at any point in the movie. The Greta Grewig directorial balances wholesomeness, hilarity and profoundness in equal measures, justifying its over the peak popularity.\n\nBarbie, in most respects, is the film of the year due to the team that made it happen. So do not wait any further, buy those movie tickets, grab a popcorn, sit back and relax as the Barbie movie takes you to the Barbie world while never losing its hold on reality.\n\n​​​​​"

        "text": "Barbie is officially the highest-grossing film of its main star Margot Robbie's Hollywood career. The Greta Gerwig-directed film surpassed David Ayer's directorial 2016 DC movie Suicide Squad to achieve this feat. Note that it is different from James Gunn's 2021 movie The Suicide Squad, which also starred Robbie. While Suicide Squad ended its theatrical run with a sum of $746.84 million, Barbie has grossed $780.71 million until now, still going strong. As per estimates, it is slated to end its theatrical run at $1 billion plus. The film is based on the iconic children's toy of the same name. The cast is absolutely stacked, and features names like Ryan Gosling, America Ferrera, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, Rhea Perlman, and Will Ferrell.\n\nWhat was Suicide Squad all about?\n\nSuicide Squad revolved around a secret government agency called Task Force X, led by Amanda Waller (played by Viola Davis). Waller assembled a group of dangerous and imprisoned supervillains with unique abilities, offering them a chance at redemption in exchange for participating in covert and dangerous missions. The team, known as the Suicide Squad, included characters such as Floyd Lawton/Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Robbie), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), and others. The team was sent on a mission to stop the ancient and mystical entity known as Enchantress (Cara Delevingne), who had taken control of archaeologist Dr June Moone's body. Enchantress intended to destroy humanity and rule over the world with her powerful abilities. Despite a pretty decent collection at the box office, the film was termed a failure due to its high budget and poor reviews.\n\nWhat is Barbie all about?\n\nBarbie follows the story of the titular doll who goes on a journey of self-discovery into the real world, after she discovers small imperfections in her previously-perfect life. Ken joins her on the journey. In the real world, they encounter issues of beauty standards and societal expectations. Barbie, Ken, and her owner, Sasha, confront their insecurities and societal pressures, leading to a transformation in Barbieland's social structure. Barbie decides to become human and embraces an ever-evolving identity in the real world.\n\nBarbie review\n\nWION's Shomini Sen wrote in her review of Barbie, \"I would still say that the film very smartly shows how society is and humanises the iconic doll. For decades Barbie has been one of the most popular toys for young girls, setting unrealistic standards of beauty. Sure, Mattel has reinvented the doll and made every girl believe that they can be whatever they want to be - just like their favourite doll, but the narrative of everything being overtly perfect has also done damage to several. Greta, in that sense, spins the narrative and adds a layer of cynicism to Barbieland to show how things are in real. Flawed, depressed, and definitely not perfect- even though the plastic remains constant.\"\n\nWATCH WION LIVE HERE"

        "text": "Margot Robbie and Leonardo DiCaprio’s Wolf of the Wall Street is both critically and commercially successful, skyrocketing the actress to new levels of fame and popularity. But even when she was doing this film, she had been a fierce woman who did shy away from shoving Leo out of her light during their s*x scene. Needless to say, the actor was shocked by her behaviour of Margot, but it was funny overall, as the actress recalled in an interview.\n\nDirected by Martin Scorsese, the film came out in 2013 and is like a cult classic like the movie; its behind-the-scenes incidents are equally famous and endless. From getting several cuts from having s*x on a pile of cash to losing an e-cigarette in the b*tt crack, a lot of things have happened.\n\nMargot Robbie, who was in her early twenties when she did the Wolf of Wall Street movie, in an interview with Manhattan magazine about the time when she pushed Leonardo DiCaprio on one side while filming a s*x scene. She recalled, “We were positioned while they lit around us in one scene, and I kind of pushed Leo’s head to one side and told him he was in my light, and he moved out of [it].”\n\nMargot Robbie continued, “He was so incredulous that I had told him to get out of my light and physically moved him out of the way, he was like, ‘Did you really just do that?'” She continued, “I don’t think anyone has told him to get out of their light in quite some time,” she added. “He seemed extremely [shocked], but it was kind of funny.”\n\nHowever, the Barbie star also added how working with Leonardo DiCaprio pushed her in a good way. She said, “Working with Leo challenged me every single second—the challenge just to keep up with him pushed me and got my acting to a level it’s never been, which is incredibly satisfying,” she said, calling the experience “a dream come true.”He’s always been my favorite actor.”\n\nOn the work front now, Margot Robbie’s current film Barbie has been running successfully in the theatres and for more such throwbacks, stay tuned to Koimoi!\n\nMust Read: Spider-Man: Beyond The Spider-Verse Vanishes Indefinitely, The Kraven The Hunter Delayed For 10 Months – Sony X Marvel Release Calendar Goes Through Massive Shuffle\n\nFollow Us: Facebook | Instagram | Twitter | Youtube | Google News"

        "text": "In the three weeks since its debut in theaters, \"Barbie\" has surpassed $1 billion in global ticket sales, marking a historic moment for the film industry as it becomes the first movie directed solely by a woman to hit this box office milestone.\n\nGreta Gerwig, who directed \"Barbie,\" joins a small group of people who have the sole directing credit on a billion-dollar movie in Hollywood's history. She now holds the box office record for women directors, which Patty Jenkins last set with \"Wonder Woman\" in 2017. That film raked in more than $800 million.\n\n\"Barbie\" has earned about $1.03 billion worldwide as of Sunday, according to Box Office Mojo. The feminist film, which Gerwig directed and co-wrote after previously receiving Oscar nominations for her earlier films \"Lady Bird\" and \"Little Women,\" already broke one major record. It had the biggest opening weekend for a women director ever, according to Fandango managing editor Erik Davis.\n\n\"Barbie\" added another $53 million from 4,178 North American locations this weekend according to studio estimates on Sunday. The Margot Robbie-led and produced film has been comfortably seated in first place for three weeks and it's hardly finished yet.\n\nA digital advertisement board displaying a Barbie movie poster is seen in New York on July 24, 2023. Selcuk Acar/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n\nIn modern box office history, just 53 movies have made over $1 billion, not accounting for inflation, and \"Barbie\" is now the biggest to be directed by one woman, supplanting \"Wonder Woman's\" $821.8 million global total. Three movies that were co-directed by women are still ahead of \"Barbie,\" including \"Frozen\" ($1.3 billion) and \"Frozen 2\" ($1.45 billion) both co-directed by Jennifer Lee and \"Captain Marvel\" ($1.1 billion), co-directed by Anna Boden. But, \"Barbie\" has passed \"Captain Marvel\" domestically with $459.4 million (versus $426.8 million), thereby claiming the North American record for live-action movies directed by women.\n\nNew competition came this weekend in the form of the animated, PG-rated \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\" and the Jason Statham shark sequel, \"Meg 2: The Trench,\" both of which were neck-in-neck with Christopher Nolan's \"Oppenheimer,\" also in its third weekend, for the second-place spot.\n\n\"Meg 2\" managed to sneak ahead and land in second place. It overcame its abysmal reviews to score a $30 million opening weekend from 3,503 locations. The Warner Bros. release, directed by Ben Wheatley, currently has a 29% critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes and a B- CinemaScore from audiences. The thriller was released in 3D, which accounted for 22% of its first weekend business.\n\nThird place went to \"Oppenheimer,\" which added $28.7 million from 3,612 locations in North America, bringing its domestic total to $228.6 million. In just three weeks, the J. Robert Oppenheimer biopic starring Cillian Murphy has become the highest grossing R-rated film of the year (ahead of \"John Wick Chapter 4\") and the sixth-biggest of the year overall, surpassing \"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.\"\n\n\"Oppenheimer\" also celebrated a landmark, crossing $500 million globally in three weeks. Its worldwide tally is currently $552.9 million, which puts it ahead of \"Dunkirk,\" which clocked out with $527 million in 2017, and has become Nolan's fifth-biggest movie ever. It's also now among the four top grossing biographies ever (company includes \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" \"The Passion of the Christ\" and \"American Sniper\") and the biggest World War II movie of all time.\n\nParamount's \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" was close behind in fourth place with an estimated $28 million from 3,858 theaters in North America. Since opening on Wednesday, the film, which is riding on excellent reviews (96% on Rotten Tomatoes) and audience scores, has earned $43.1 million.\n\n\"This is one of those movies that is a multigenerational joy,\" said Chris Aronson, Paramount's president of domestic distribution. \"I think the enduring popularity of 'Turtles' is showing its true colors. And there hasn't been an animated film in eight weeks and there won't be another for eight weeks which is great for us.\"\n\n\"Turtles\" cost $70 million to produce and features a starry voice cast that includes Jackie Chan, Ice Cube, Paul Rudd, Ayo Edebiri and Seth Rogen, who produced and co-wrote the film, which leans into the \"teenage\" aspect of the turtles.\n\n\"Barbie,\" \"Oppenheimer\" and even the surprise, anti-trafficking hit \"Sound of Freedom\" (now at $163.5 million and ahead of \"Mission: Impossible 7\") have helped fuel a boom at the box office, bringing in many millions more than was expected and helping to offset pains caused by some summer disappointments.\n\n\"After 'The Flash,' 'Indiana Jones' and, to a certain extent, 'Mission: Impossible,' people were saying the summer was a disappointment. But it's not over yet,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \"We're going to have a summer that is going to go out on a high note.\"\n\nBut the moment of triumph for the industry will likely be short lived if the studios can't reach an agreement with striking actors and writers soon. The fall release calendar has already gotten slimmer, with some studios pushing films into 2024 instead of trying to promote them without movie stars.\n\nSony had planned to release its PlayStation-inspired true story \"Gran Turismo\" in theaters nationwide next Friday, but will now be rolling it out slowly for two weeks before going wide on Aug. 25. The thinking? If movie stars can't promote the film, maybe audiences can.\n\n\"We have to be realistic,\" Dergarabedian said. \"We're on this emotional high of movies doing so well, but we have to temper our enthusiasm and optimism with the fact that the strike is creating a lot of uncertainty. The longer it goes on the more profound the issues become. But the audience has spoken and they love going to the movie theater.\"\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.\n\n1. \"Barbie,\" $53 million.\n\n2. \"Meg 2: The Trench,\" $30 million.\n\n3. \"Oppenheimer,\" $28.7 million.\n\n4. \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,\" $28 million.\n\n5. \"Haunted Mansion,\" $9 million.\n\n6. \"Sound of Freedom,\" $7 million.\n\n7. \"Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part I,\" $6.5 million.\n\n8. \"Talk to Me,\" $6.3 million.\n\n9. \"Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani,\" $1.5 million.\n\n10. \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,\" $1.5 million."

Discovery 's 100-year history. The film surpassed Christopher Nolan's \"The Dark Knight,\" which generated $536 million in 2008, for the title.\n\nThe bubblegum pink collaboration between filmmaker Greta Gerwig, Mattel and Warner Bros. has collected more than $1.2 billion at the global box office since its July 21 release.\n\nIt is the first billion-dollar film for the newly minted Warner Bros. Discovery, the result of the Warner Media and Discover merger in 2022, and only the second movie released in 2023 to do so. Universal's \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" has topped $1.3 billion since its April debut.\n\nThe success of \"Barbie\" comes at a time when blockbuster-budgeted films have struggled to connect with moviegoing audiences. Alongside Nolan's latest feature \"Oppenheimer,\" which has grossed more than $250 million domestically, \"Barbie\" proves that moviegoers are still interested in leaving their couches for quality films and unique communal experiences.\n\nThe Margot Robbie-led film has been number one at the box office since its debut and is on track to be the highest-grossing film of the year. Box office analysts expect \"Barbie\" to continue to collect box office receipts in the weeks to come, as it faces limited competition from new releases and rides a wave of positive word of mouth.\n\nDisclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC."

        "text": "The highly anticipated \"Barbie\" movie, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, is in theaters now, but there have been multiple controversies leading up to the film’s release.\n\nAfter years in development, with different writers and stars attached, including comedian Amy Schumer and Oscar-winner Diablo Cody, the film went into production with Robbie starring as the iconic doll.\n\nBut as soon as the first full trailer for the movie arrived, controversies began to stir.\n\nSome fans complained about Ryan Gosling's casting as Ken, and as the marketing blitz for the film began, several international issues arose, from a raunchy translation on the French poster to the film being banned in Vietnam.\n\nOSCAR-WINNING SCREENWRITER LEFT FAILED SONY ‘BARBIE’ MOVIE BECAUSE STUDIO WANTED ‘GIRL-BOSS FEMINIST TWIST'\n\n\"Barbie\" has also faced claims that it is an overly woke story about the children's doll, with one site writing, \"Warning: Don't take your daughter to Barbie.\"\n\nHere are some of the controversies \"Barbie\" faced during its journey to the big screen.\n\nRyan Gosling's Ken\n\nWhen the first full trailer for the movie was released in April, some fans criticized Gosling as being too old to play Ken, opposite Robbie’s Barbie.\n\n\"Ryan Gosling is too ugly and too old to be playing ken, they should’ve casted Henry Cavill or Chris Evans bye,\" declared one person on Twitter at the time.\n\nOthers came to his defense. \"I just cannot believe that we live in a world where people think Ryan Gosling is either ‘too ugly’ or ‘too old’ to be playing a live action Ken doll. Y’all can’t be serious. So incredibly mean & untrue & he will truly be the clear standout in that film,\" one person wrote.\n\nBefore \"Barbie’s\" release, Gosling addressed some of the controversy surrounding his casting.\n\nMARGOT ROBBIE SHARES THE ‘DORKY’ ACTRESS WHO TURNED DOWN ‘BARBIE,’ EXPLAINS WHY ICONIC DOLL IS NOT 'SEXY'\n\n\"I would say, you know, if people don’t want to play with my Ken, there are many other Kens to play with,\" he told GQ in May.\n\n\"It is funny, this kind of clutching-your-pearls idea of, like, #notmyken,\" he continued. \"Like you ever thought about Ken before this?\"\n\nThe 42-year-old also spoke about some people’s reactions to Ken being a sort of secondary figure to Barbie in the movie.\n\nGosling explained that Ken’s \"job has been beach\" since the doll’s introduction in 1961, two years after the original Barbie doll.\n\n\"And everyone was fine with that, for him to have a job that is nothing. But suddenly, it’s like, ‘No, we’ve cared about Ken this whole time.’ No, you didn’t,\" the \"La La Land\" star said. \"You never did. You never cared. Barbie never f----- with Ken. That’s the point.\"\n\n\"If you ever really cared about Ken, you would know that nobody cared about Ken. So your hypocrisy is exposed,\" Gosling added.\n\nOSCAR-WINNING SCREENWRITER LEFT FAILED SONY ‘BARBIE’ MOVIE BECAUSE STUDIO WANTED ‘GIRL-BOSS FEMINIST TWIST'\n\nThe tagline for the poster does indicate that Ken doesn’t have as much going on as Barbie. It reads, \"She’s everything. He’s just Ken.\"\n\nNSFW French Poster\n\nThe film's tagline caused a stir when it was translated for the French poster, going viral for a dirtier meaning that may or may not have been intended.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, the tagline in French reads, \"Elle peut tout faire. Lui, c’est juste Ken\" – meaning \"She can do everything. He’s just Ken,\" a fairly close match to the original English.\n\nHowever, \"Ken\" has a double meaning in French slang, meaning the f-word, making the tagline \"She can do everything. He just knows how to f---.\"\n\nWhether or not the double entendre was intentional is up for debate, but, according to a French marketing executive from a different studio who spoke with THR, there was no other way for it to be taken.\n\n\"It’s definitely deliberate; there’s no way a French speaker wouldn’t have noticed the dirty pun,\" they said. \"It’s sort of genius, really, that they slipped that in.\"\n\nIn a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, Warner Bros. Discovery said, \"The speculation around the Barbie marketing campaign shows that there is a high level of awareness and major excitement from the public surrounding the upcoming release of our film in France. We can’t wait for audiences around the world to see the film upon its release next month.\"\n\nWARNER BROS. DENIES 'BARBIE' MAP ENDORSES CHINA'S DISPUTED TERRITORIAL CLAIMS: 'MAKE-BELIEVE'\n\n\"Barbie\" Banned in Vietnam\n\nEarlier this month, \"Barbie\" was banned in Vietnam due to a scene featuring a map that shows China’s unilaterally claimed territory in the South China Sea, which the country said violates their sovereignty.\n\nAccording to Variety, the director general of the Vietnam Cinema Department told the state-run newspaper Tuoi Tre, \"We do not grant license for the movie 'Barbie' to release in Vietnam because it contains the offending image of the nine-dash line.\"\n\nThe controversial \"nine dash line\" is used on maps to illustrate China's claims over areas of the South China Sea, including portions Vietnam considers its own. In 2016, The Hague ruled the line invalid, and, according to Variety, while the resolution is binding, China has said it does not recognize the decision.\n\nA Warner Bros. Film Group spokesperson told Variety, \"The map in Barbie Land is a child-like crayon drawing. The doodles depict Barbie’s make-believe journey from Barbie Land to the ‘real world.’ It was not intended to make any type of statement.\"\n\nThe government in the Philippines also considered banning the film over the drawing but decided against it.\n\nCHINA REACTS AFTER 'BARBIE' MOVIE DEPICTS CONTROVERSIAL MAP FAVORED BY BEIJING\n\nAccording to THR, the country’s Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTPCB) said in a letter released to the public that the board found there was \"no basis to ban the film.\"\n\nIt did request the image be blurred to ensure audiences wouldn’t \"misinterpret\" the scene.\n\nThe overall plot of \"Barbie\" will follow Robbie’s main Barbie character as she experiences an existential crisis and visits the real world in a journey of self-discovery, accompanied by Gosling’s Ken.\n\nWoke \"Barbie\"\n\nThe world of \"Barbie\" is populated with an all-star cast playing a wide variety of Barbies and Kens, including \"Insecure\" star Issa Rae, \"SNL’s\" Kate McKinnon, and Marvel star Simu Liu.\n\nLiu spoke about the diverse array of dolls come to life in an interview with Screenrant’s Joe Deckelmeier in July, highlighting how the movie challenges \"heteronormative\" ideas about gender.\n\n\"You know, colors became gendered, toys became gendered, there were all these rules that were imposed on us,\" he said. \"So, Barbie was always like, ‘Oh that’s not my toy. That’s on the other toy’. And I’m so glad that this movie exists because I think it puts the final nail in the coffin of that very heteronormative idea of what gender is, and what is or is not gendered. How can you make a color gendered, you know?\"\n\n\"That’s, I think, what’s really struck me about being in this movie, what’s evolved in my understanding of Barbie and what it is, and what I hope that an audience will get from it when they watch the movie,\" he added.\n\n'BARBIE' ACTRESS KATE MCKINNON CLAIMS FILM SHOWS HOW 'GENDER ROLES DENY PEOPLE HALF THEIR HUMANITY'\n\n\"Barbie\" also features transgender actress Hari Nef, who told Out Magazine the movie has an empowering message about being transgender.\n\n\"As much as there’s a celebration of femininity and being a girl in this [movie], I think there’s also an encouragement of letting go of the checklist we ascribe to living and living your life and being in your body your way, on your own terms,\" Nef said.\n\nThe faith-based film review site, Movieguide, took issue with what they consider an abandonment of the core audience for a Barbie doll movie, families and young girls, in favor of LGBTQ stories.\n\n\"The new BARBIE movie forgets its core audience of families and children while catering to nostalgic adults and pushing lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender character stories.

        "text": "CNN —\n\nAuthorities in Lebanon moved to ban the “Barbie” movie from cinemas on Wednesday, saying it promotes homosexuality and violates the nation’s values.\n\nCulture Minister Mohammad Mortada banned the film from cinemas after delaying its release date to late August, saying it contradicts the “moral and religious values as well as the principles of Lebanon,” state-run media reported Wednesday.\n\nThe minister said the movie also “promotes sexual deviance and transsexuality,” by Lebanese state-run media on Wednesday. “Sexual deviance” is a term commonly used in the Middle East to refer to homosexuals.\n\nThe ban comes amid heightened anti-LGBTQ rhetoric by some politicians and government officials in Lebanon and the wider Middle East.\n\nHassan Nasrallah, the leader of Lebanon’s Shiite Islamist Hezbollah movement, launched a tirade against homosexuals in late July during a speech marking Ashura, which commemorates the killing of the Hussain bin Ali, Prophet Mohammed’s grandson, in the 7th century.\n\nHe referred to homosexuality as “sexual perversion” and identified same-sex relations as a “threat” to Lebanon.\n\nDays earlier, Nasrallah threatened the LGBTQ community in a video message, encouraging the use of derogatory terms and for them to be punished.\n\nLGBTQ people have reported online harassment and death threats following the speech, Human Rights Watch said in a report.\n\nLebanon was once considered one of the most socially liberal countries in the Middle East, but the government has been cracking down on LGBTQ events.\n\nKuwait also moved to ban the “Barbie” movie, claiming it carries “ideas that encourage unacceptable behavior and a message that distorts the prevailing values of society,” according to state-run KUNA news agency.\n\nAnti-LGBTQ sentiment is also on the rise in Iraq, where the state media regulator on Tuesday issued a media ban of the words “homosexuality” and “gender,” requiring it to be replaced with “sexual deviance.” The censorship is in effect for all media outlets, phone and internet companies. There was no penalty set for breaking the rule but a fine was alluded to.\n\nRainbow flags have been burned in recent protests by Shiite Muslim groups in Iraq in opposition to the Quran burnings in Denmark and Sweden.\n\n“Barbie” blew past box-office expectations, hitting $1 billion in box office revenues three weeks since its release.\n\nThe movie was also banned in Vietnam in early July, over a map depicting China’s claim to the South China sea."

        "text": "Many current TV shows and movies are reboots of existing franchises. Why has this one been so culturally omnipresent?\n\nThe marketers at Warner Bros are being touted as geniuses, credited with the blockbuster success of the Barbie movie. The movie has already grossed $1 billion in box office sales, with a marketing spend estimated at $150 million and a similar cost for the movie. It’s a great ROI but there are other important factors contributing to the movie’s success.\n\nThe real genius was the writer who understood and validated our powerful mixed feelings about Barbie. We loved her, idolized her, chopped off her hair, made fun of her, and felt a little icky about the stereotypes and gender roles she represents.\n\nBarbie is the number-one girls’ brand in the world, and has been for most of her 50-year lifespan. When I worked as a brand manager on Barbie, we were selling a Barbie doll every second, and girls received, on average, five Barbie dolls per year. Mattel reports that more than 90% of girls own a Barbie. Their long-term marketing investment had built up a $700 million brand valuation before the movie released, and this brand has an emotional engagement that translates really well to a film. Many girls play with Barbies every day, telling stories and imagining themselves as Barbie. I can think of no other brand that approaches this level of reach and depth of engagement.\n\nThe core movie audience is anyone who used to play with Barbie—90% of women and our teenage daughters. But the real genius was the writer who understood and validated our powerful mixed feelings about Barbie. We loved her, idolized her, chopped off her hair, made fun of her, and felt a little icky about the stereotypes and gender roles she represents. The trailer promises, “If you love Barbie, this movie is for you. If you hate Barbie, this movie is for you.” The secret is that we feel both ways.\n\nAlong with the brand value and emotional engagement, the crossover adult/teen targeting made possible the biggest co-branding and licensing coup in…the history of the world, maybe? Warner Brothers and Mattel fully capitalized their crossover licensing opportunities—toys, adult fashion, car insurance, you name it. The theater where I watched the movie was promoting a Barbie-branded pink gin cocktail. (It was pretty good.) Airbnb partnered on an actual Barbie Dream House in Malibu.\n\nPart of the appeal of partnering with Warner Bros. to promote this film was that it wasn’t already a franchise. The release of the first live-action Barbie movie marked a historic moment that would be covered in news outlets, not just entertainment media. So unlike Indiana Jones and Mission Impossible, Barbie offered a significant publicity opportunity. And who doesn’t want to make history?\n\nDid the movie and its marketing represent something new for how Barbie presents women?\n\nAlthough the film is a lot of fun, I left with mixed feelings. Mattel has always wanted moms to think of Barbie as a strong and inclusive role model, and the film reinforces those brand characteristics. But at her core, Barbie has been and will always be about materialism. She’s a fashion doll and Mattel releases a new line of Barbie products every six months that they really want you to buy. You buy Barbie new clothes, do her hair, dress her up. You play that she’s shopping with her friends. If your parents are rich, maybe she gets to live in the $179 house she dreams of. If your parents are woke, maybe she has a non-White, differently abled sidekick to go shopping with. But blonde, skinny, White, stereotypical Barbie will always be the star. Her feet will always be pointy, her waist will always be tiny, and she will always be about looking beautiful and having things. Don’t get me wrong; girls enjoy playing with Barbies this way. It’s fun. But it’s definitely not feminism.\n\nAre there lessons for how brands can refresh other cultural products with a strong but possibly outdated image?\n\nThe Barbie one-two punch that some legacy brands could copy is to poke fun at themselves, then deliver a message that feels timely and relevant.\n\nIn the first half of the film, the audience is laughing at everything about Barbie world. Her silly feet, her airhead boyfriend Ken, his feeling so unnecessary (because he is). The filmmakers embrace the cringe, and we love them for it. After laughing at and along with Barbie, we become open-minded. Then America Ferrera nails the landing with her un-brainwashing speech, “It is literally impossible to be a woman.” We relate to everything she says. We wouldn’t have associated those ideas with Barbie (not at all!) but now we’re actually listening. Humor does that. Ferrera’s words work like a magic spell on the Barbies, waking them from the fog of patriarchy. The real magic it works is on us though, making us think Barbie might be kind of cool after all."

        "text": "In one of the most highly-anticipated movies of summer 2023, Barbie not only brings Barbieland to life, but it also features several incredible cameos. For one, America Ferrera’s real-life husband, Ryan Piers Williams, actually starred as her on-screen husband in the Warner Bros. Pictures film. The movie follows Barbie’s (played by Margot Robbie) journey into the real world, where she meets Ferrera’s character Gloria, an employee of Mattel toy company, and her teenage daughter, Sasha (played by Ariana Greenblatt). The mother and daughter partner with one another to help Barbie return to Barbieland.\n\nDavid M. Benett / Getty Images\n\nWhile leaving the real world, Gloria wonders if her husband would care that she left and if he would be fine without her. Then, the movie shows Gloria’s spouse practicing Spanish, completely unaware that his wife and daughter are heading to a different dimension. It turns out that Gloria’s husband is actually Ferrera’s actual husband in real life.\n\nAt the end of the movie, Ferrera's husband also makes another appearance as her character Gloria's spouse. In the scene, Williams’ character is shown sitting in a car with Gloria, Sasha, and Barbie, attempting to tell Barbie in Spanish that he's proud of her. “Estoy orgullosa de ti,” he tells her. He also says, “Sí se puede,” which is a reference to Gotta Kick It Up!, Ferrera’s 2002 Disney Channel movie, according to Today.\n\nFerrera managed to keep her husband’s role in the movie a secret, but she gave subtle hints on social media. On July 13, 2023, Ferrera promoted Barbie by posting a photo with her husband posing on a pink carpet during the movie’s premiere. “My favorite & forever Ken, you cute💙🖤💕,” she wrote in her caption. Later, some fans picked up on the fact that the couple brought their real-life romance to the motion picture. “Your real husband played your movie husband?!” one fan asked. Another commented, “I loved his cameo role he was so funny 😂.” Williams uploaded a similar photo from the premiere along with a supportive message to his wife. “I can’t wait for you all to see America in this film! 🔥😍🔥 #barbieworld,” he said. Some of his friends and followers flocked to the comments section to share positive opinions on his role after watching the movie, which premiered on July 21, 2023. “Can't lie, a certain cameo was the highlight for me 😉😁,” one person wrote.\n\nAccording to The Cut, director Greta Gerwig wrote Gloria’s part with partner Noah Baumbach after being a fan of Ugly Betty. In October 2022, Ferrera told People that her children, Sebastian Piers and Lucia Marisol, weren’t aware that their parents would be acting together in the box office recording-breaking film since they are five and three years old. “They don’t really have any context for it,” the actress explained. “So, one day [they might care], but not now. They’re still too young.”\n\nFerrera and Williams first met in 2005 while the actress was a student a the University of Southern California and a rising star in Hollywood. At the time, Williams cast Ferrera in his first short film called “Muertas.” They started dating shortly after, and five years later, Williams popped the question. The following year, the two of them tied the knot. Although the pair is proud parents to two children, they keep most of their family life off of social media."

The success of the fantasy-comedy was further boosted by the coupling with \"Oppenheimer\", the biopic chronicling the creation of the atomic bomb during World War Two that opened on the same weekend.\n\nBut the \"Barbenheimer\" combo sparked a backlash in Japan, as the nation earlier this month marked the memorials of the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki 78 years ago.\n\nIn now-deleted posts on platform X, formerly known as Twitter, Warner Bros' \"Barbie\" marketing account had latched on to fan-produced memes that depicted Robbie with \"Oppenheimer\" actor Cillian Murphy alongside images of nuclear blasts.\n\nA Change.org petition was launched on Aug 1, demanding that Warner Bros and Universal Pictures, the studio behind \"Oppenheimer\", call a halt to the #Barbenheimer hashtag on social media. It has collected about 22,600 signatures to date.\n\nA #NoBarbenheimer hashtag trended in Japan at the time, prompting Warner's Japan division to issue a rare public criticism of its U.S. parent company, which then followed with an apology last week.\n\nMitsuki Takahata, who voiced Barbie in the dubbed Japanese version, said in an Aug 2 Instagram post that she was dismayed upon learning of the memes. \"This incident is really, really disappointing,\" she posted.\n\nStill, Japanese fans of the movie, which sends Mattel Inc's (MAT.O) iconic doll into real life, said the controversy did not discourage them from visiting theatres.\n\n\"It was harsh\", said 24-year-old university student Rie Takeda, commenting on the fan-produced #Barbenheimer memes.\n\n\"But the movie was radiant, beyond that I had fun\" watching it, she said.\n\nNo Japan release date has been announced for \"Oppenheimer\", which has been criticised for largely ignoring the atomic bomb's destruction of two major Japanese cities in 1945, accounting for more than 200,000 deaths.\n\nReporting by Kantaro Komiya and Akiko Okamoto; Additional reporting by Rocky Swift, Editing by William Maclean\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

        "text": "Mothering two imaginative girls, Jasmine and Natalie, I spent many years watching them play with Barbie dolls. Seeing their creative minds plan soirées at the Barbie mansion, towering in a corner of Natalie’s bedroom, was like watching a sitcom. Sometimes Ken and his friends were fortunate enough to make it out of the toy box to join the fun, but usually, it was all about the girls. From brunches to pool parties or road trips in luxury convertibles, my daughters’ dolls lived well and without limitations.\n\nThis past Sunday, Natalie and I fancied up in cute, pink dresses for a grand outing we’d been anticipating for months, the “Barbie” movie. She invited two of her own Barbies, Sasha and Marla, whom she and Jasmine used to play with, to go with us. During the drive to Malco Grandview Cinema & IMAX, she dressed them for the show.\n\nCruising down Lakeland to I-55, from Flowood to Madison, all four of us vibed in our pastel, floral prints while listening to Lizzo, Dua Lipa, Nikki Minaj, Ice Spice and Aqua. The only missing player was Jasmine, who lives in Detroit and had seen the movie three days earlier.\n\nAs we walked into Malco, Natalie and I instantly became participants in a cross-generational gathering of women with a cultural connection steeped in mutual stories and experiences. Each girl and woman self-represented in a communal fashion show featuring elaborate, colorful hairstyles; dresses ranging from casual to formal; Barbie T-shirts; pink shorts; and shoes symbolic of inclusivity—heels, Converse, sandals and combat boots. It felt like a pre-party before the main event.\n\nThe hype was on the button.\n\nEvery second of the movie evinces brilliant writing, critical consciousness and cultural competence. The story of Barbie is contextualized in such a way that every victory for and atrocity against women is equally exhilarating and exhausting.\n\nBarbie’s world is highly functional, productive and prosperous when women are in control and in charge of their own lives, without interference from a fragile, egotistical and overly sensitive patriarchy. Ensuing feelings of insecurity and personal inadequacy trigger male aggression and a scathing attack on women’s personhood.\n\nMost disturbing is the real-world setback of women’s rights playing out on America’s national stage and systemic sabotaging of decades of hard labor.\n\nThe most ironic point in the movie comes when Ruth Handler’s ghost makes the iconic statement, “We mothers stand still so our daughters can look back to see how far they have come.”\n\nAs a mom, I watched the movie’s hostile-takeover scenes, imagining myself in my daughter’s shoes, young women stripped of rights that were guaranteed to me when I was their age. The clock’s hands should not move backward.\n\nThrough mom lenses, the “Barbie” movie’s celebration of women’s landmark achievements and the opportunities available to my daughters energized me. Positions such as president, doctor, lawyer, and journalist were not as easily attainable for women when I was Jasmine’s and Natalie’s age. Although the writers spotlight progress to an extent, they are creative in reversing roles, presenting a world that excludes men, while also reflecting the disparaging circumstances we all face when any group is the target of gender inequality.\n\nToday’s Barbie Symbolizes Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nI’m old enough to have witnessed Barbie’s transition from largely static to admirably variable. As a girl, I didn’t own any Barbie dolls, just baby dolls, a problematic cultural standard once heavily forced onto girls, as addressed in the movie’s introduction. My mother didn’t have a problem with Barbies. Representation mattered to her. She insisted that all of my dolls look like me. To this day, I’m grateful to her for caring about my identity formation.\n\nWhere I was growing up in Brookhaven, Miss., a Black Barbie doll on a toy store shelf did not come a dime a dozen. By the time I became a mother, a more relatable Barbie had emerged, one that I, unlike my mother, could comfortably introduce to Jasmine and Natalie.\n\nFortunately, my daughters experienced a Barbie culture inclusive of not only skin tones in their likeness, but also varying hair textures, facial features and body types. More importantly, Barbie became a symbol of diversity, equity and inclusion, encompassing the lives and stories of women from an increased intersectional perspective.\n\n“Barbie” the movie portrayed a group of women with lifestyles identical to Jasmine and Natalie’s Barbie dolls. Watching the film, I thought about my little girls sitting on the floor with Barbie clothing, shoes, accessories, sports cars and other luxuries scattered about.\n\nAt certain points during the movie, I laughed and cried, rejoicing in knowing that my daughters were doing more than just playing with dolls. They were creating a world that young women owned—their Barbies with no glass ceilings, no threats to their personhood. Sitting at the brunch tables, swimming at the pool parties and driving the colorful sports cars were professional Black women, happy and thriving. Through their engagement with Barbie dolls, my girls were creating a world that they were raised to believe is attainable for them.\n\nJasmine and Natalie are college-educated adults now. Neither is clueless to the obstacles set against them. Both are empowered to self-advocate and expect no less than what they have worked hard to attain. As their mom, I can say that every second of the “Barbie” movie resonated with me because our lives and stories were well-represented.\n\nThis MFP Voices essay does not necessarily represent the views of the Mississippi Journalism and Education Group, the Mississippi Free Press, its staff or board members.

        "text": "Press play to listen to this article Voiced by artificial intelligence.\n\nWelcome to Declassified, a weekly humor column.\n\nAn entirely plastic figure with no obvious genitalia and a blank expression who lives in a fabricated world … but enough about Donald Trump, let’s talk about Barbie.\n\nAnything as popular as the Barbie movie has to get political, and that is what’s happened. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak tweeted that his family had chosen “Barbie” ahead of the other big cinema release, “Oppenheimer.” To be fair, Sunak has young daughters and the codes to actual nuclear weapons, so it was always likely to be “Barbie” that he chose to see first.\n\nHopefully, Sunak’s children haven’t seen the posters that have been popping up in London that cast senior members of the Conservative Party as characters in the Barbie film alongside attacks on their positions on immigration and a variation on the hashtag “ThisBarbieIs…” that ends with a word beginning with C that isn’t exactly wholesome or suitable for a family publication (if indeed this is a family publication).\n\nNot everyone is as pro-“Barbie” as Sunak. Germany’s health minister, Karl Lauterbach, announced that he wouldn’t be going to see the movie, without specifying why. Germany was of course home to the Lilli doll, believed to be the inspiration for Barbie but which was a bigger, more curvaceous version of the American product and which originated on the pages of Bild (the bigger, more curvaceous version of this publication).\n\nAlso unhappy at “Barbie” was an American right-wing commentator, the permanently furious Ben Shapiro, who posted a 43-minute-long video (the film itself is only 113 minutes!) complaining about it.\n\n“My producers dragged me to see ‘Barbie’ and it was one of the most woke movies I have ever seen,” Shapiro said, before adding: “Let me begin with my generalized assessment of the movie. This movie is not just a piece of shit. This movie is a flaming piece of dogshit, piled atop an entire dumpster on fire, piled atop a landfill filled with dogshit.”\n\nShapiro — who, lest you forget, is an actual adult — also threw a Barbie doll into a bin on top of some other Barbie dolls and set them on fire.\n\nIt was perhaps the oddest meltdown by someone from the American right since Tucker Carlson devoted an entire section of his TV show to complaining that M&Ms had gone woke and redesigned the cartoons used to advertise the candy to be “less sexy,” with the Green M&M swapping her boots for sneakers. That of course prompted the sadly unanswered question: “Does Tucker Carlson fancy multicolored button-shaped chocolate?”\n\nCAPTION COMPETITION\n\n“The ‘Star Wars’ franchise finally runs out of steam and budget.”\n\nCan you do better? Email [email protected] or on Twitter @pdallisonesque\n\nLast time we gave you this photo:\n\nThanks for all the entries. Here’s the best from our postbag — there’s no prize except for the gift of laughter, which I think we can all agree is far more valuable than cash or booze.\n\n“There she goes! That should make American economists think twice before trying to steal our jobs,” by Tom Morgan"

Such restrictions have led to speculation that the movie might encounter similar challenges in countries like Brunei, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Taiwan.\n\nCritics suggest that the movie's themes and content might run afoul of local standards, values, and sensitivities, potentially leading to its prohibition in the UAE and Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhile no official confirmation has been provided to support these claims, the possibility of a Barbie-less summer in the Middle East has sparked concern among ardent fans."

But if not for arranging a last-minute Zoom call with the director, Cera might not have made it into the film.\n\n“It was a kind of very last-minute casting,” Cera said in a video interview with GQ conducted before the actors strike. “My manager got a call checking on my availability for it, and he called me and he said, ‘I got a call about this movie. It’s the “Barbie” movie. Greta Gerwig’s directing it, and it’s filming in London for four months of something, so I told them you probably wouldn’t want to to do it because you probably don’t want to go to London.'”\n\nCera continued, “I was like, ‘What! Call them back!’ He didn’t like blow it or anything, but he’s like, ‘I managed their expectations that you might not want to do it.’ I was like, ‘How can I not do it? I need to do it!'”\n\nCera then took matters into his own hands.\n\n“I somehow got Greta’s email address, I think through a common friend of ours, and I emailed her like, ‘Can I be in it? Can I do that part?'” Cera said. “And she was like, ‘Let’s get on a Zoom right now. Here’s a Zoom link, I’ll be on there for the next hour.’ So she was just hanging out on the Zoom, like, ‘Click the link whenever you’re ready.’ And then we talked about it, and it just all happened really fast from there.”\n\nIn “Barbie,” Cera plays the shy, short-lived companion of Ken. While there are countless iterations of Ken, there is only one Allan.\n\n“Allan is a sad figure. He’s just a person that doesn’t really have any place in the world,” explained Cera.\n\nBut why did Mattel discontinue the doll?\n\nAccording to Cera, “It just wasn’t selling. The world just didn’t need for Ken to have a friend… Barbie is good, we can get a lot more Barbies in here, and friends of hers. But we’ve got Ken, and we don’t need to go deeper in that direction. So Allan fell by the wayside a little bit.”\n\n“Barbie” recently surpassed Christopher Nolan’s “The Dark Knight” as Warner Bros.’ highest-grossing domestic release in history, with over $537 million in the U.S. and Canada. The pink fantasia has collected more than $1.2 billion globally and has remained the No. 1 movie for four consecutive weeks.\n\nWatch Cera’s full GQ interview below."

The Kumkum star took to Instagram with a lengthy note on Monday, calling out the ‘inappropriate’ film for its seemingly adult themes. The well known TV actor said that she had walked out of the theatre within mere minutes after going to watch the movie with her 10-year-old daughter.\n\nWhile Parmar acknowledged that she had not noticed the film was rated PG-13, she added that \"the language and content is inappropriate even for children 13 and above\".\n\n“10 minutes into the movie, inappropriate language, sexual connotations and I was anxiously running out of the theater wondering what had I just exposed my child to. She had been waiting to watch your film and here I was just shocked, disappointed and heartbroken with what I had just exposed her to. I was the first one to walk out of the movie within 10-15 minutes and by the time I reached out, I saw other parents following with their little ones crying, while some parents chose to stay back to watch the entire movie,\" she wrote.\n\nThe remarks have not gone down well with netizens, many of whom urged Parmar to “maybe try watching the entire thing\" before forming an opinion.\n\n“In your entire post you give no example of what was even inappropriate in the movie. The reason it's PG-13 is because Barbie is a functioning adult and the movie has themes deeper than a child could ever understand. The only reason you're pissed is because they showed Barbie as an actual woman and not just the perfect idea you've been feeding your kids. If you watched the entire thing (with or without your kid) you would have been able to write a more intellectual review than whatever this post is,\" read one irate comment.\n\nI guess you need to understand that this movie is not adult because of why you have mentioned but because it talks about deeper themes like existential crisis, mental health, and patriarchy which might be too heavy for children to understand,\" wrote another.\n\n“Please do not bad mouth such a beautifully made movie just because you didn’t do your research properly and mistook it to be some Disney movie,\" added another comment.\n\n“It's not the films job to parent your child. Read the ratings and take a call. Sensitive much? Barbie has always been sexualised, where have you been?\" wrote another individual.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)\n\nMilestone Alert!Livemint tops charts as the fastest growing news website in the world 🌏 Click here to know more."

Scroll on down to choose your Barbie. :)\n\nThis gingham dress\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures\n\nYou can just never go wrong with a pink and gingham combo. This dress is such a sweet retro-inspired look with its A-line skirt and semi-scoop neckline.

        "text": "British actor Rob Brydon has revealed he finds it hurtful when Barbie fans question why he was cast in the record-breaking movie.\n\nBrydon appears as Sugar Daddy Ken in the movie, which has this week passed $1billion at the box office, becoming the highest-grossing ever film made by a woman as a sole director.\n\nHe told The Times newspaper:\n\n“It does slightly sting that some people are saying, ‘What’s he doing in such a big Hollywood movie?’\n\n“I am resigned to the fact that it’s the price I pay for not taking the big acting roles in America and doing quiz shows and voiceovers here [in the UK] instead.\n\nThe Welsh actor has shared that he got his role in the blockbuster, due to having a famous fan. It transpired that Margot Robbie, who lived in London at the beginning of her film career, was a big follower of British comedy Gavin & Stacey, in which Brydon appeared as Uncle Bryn.\n\nThe actor told the newspaper: “You never know who’s watching, do you? Margot loved Gavin & Stacey and a few years ago a friend of hers asked me to record a video message for her as Bryn. To be honest I’d forgotten all about it, and then I get the call for Barbie, and the response to it has been extraordinary.\n\n“I am not here to blow my own trumpet, but there is a lesson for young actors — do your best in every role. [Director] Greta Gerwig told me she was a fan of Human Remains [a BBC comedy, in which Brydon played seven different men going through various divorces, released back in 2000], which amazed me.”\n\nOther names to join Brydon in Barbie include the new Doctor Who actor Ncuti Gatwa, Bridgerton’s Nicola Coughlan and Sex Education star Emma Mackey. Dua Lipa also appears, as well as contributing to the soundtrack.\n\nBrydon told The Times he had eschewed American screen offers because he wanted to stay in the UK with his family.\n\n“I am not prepared to make the sacrifices to make films or TV in Hollywood or Atlanta or Vancouver, wherever the tax breaks for filming are these days, because believe me there are sacrifices,” he said. “There has to be something inside you that needs that level of success and fame. I don’t have it.”"

        "text": "In a suite in Manhattan’s Chelsea Hotel, Greta Gerwig’s phone rings. ‘Sail away, sail away, sail away,’ it warbles, over familiar strings. ‘Oh no. Sorry,’ says Gerwig, springing up from her chair, as the song keeps on blaring until the she can find it. ‘My ringtone is Enya,’ she says, having eventually silenced the ring tone. ‘Because phones ringing are anxious. And Enya is wonderful.’\n\nThat Gerwig would try to self-soothe with late-80s Irish synth pop during the most high-pressure moment of her career is understandable. Because it’s safe to say that she has a lot on when we meet, having only recently finished the Barbie movie she has directed and co-written. The pre-release buzz for the film has been extraordinary; every scrap of gossip, every leaked paparazzi photo of its stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, as Barbie and Ken, rollerblading in neon kneepads has been a viral moment. On TikTok, the BarbieTheMovie hashtag has a cool 991.5m views.\n\nLIA CLAY MILLER\n\nGerwig’s involvement has intrigued pop culture geeks from the start: her fans would not have had a Barbie blockbuster on their bingo card. She is known for naturalistic, indie-skewing movies, starring in Greenberg (2010) with Ben Stiller and acting in and co-writing Frances Ha (2012), both of which capitalised on her whimsical, relatable, charisma. She later directed Lady Bird (2017), which was partly inspired by her childhood in Sacramento, California, and a 2019 adaptation of Little Women, both of which were Oscar nominated.\n\nGrowing up, she says, ‘My mom wasn’t crazy about Barbie. It wasn’t something that felt, necessarily, approved, which made it more intriguing.’ Her family didn’t have a TV, she wasn’t allowed to wear logos: this was not a world of Barbie Dream House-style all-American consumerism. ‘Part of the reason I think I was so intrigued [by this project],’ she says, ‘is because, not even intellectually, but from deep inside, I understand the counter-arguments. That feels rich.’\n\nBarbie is literally plastic. She’s unchanging. If you threw her out, she just wouldn't disintegrate. If I could give that persona some humanity, some falling-apart-ness, that - in and of itself - would be be meaningful\n\nShe hopes the film subverts sexist stereotypes. Barbie, she says, is, ‘literally plastic. She’s unchanging. If you threw her out, she just wouldn't disintegrate. If I could give that persona some humanity, some falling-apart-ness, that – in and of itself – would be be meaningful.’ Also, ‘In this sort of double mirror of the movie, Margot Robbie is also a person we expect to be perfect. What does that mean that we also do that? Is she allowed to fall apart and be vulnerable?’\n\nIt was Robbie, the film's producer, who initially brought Gerwig on board as a writer. Gerwig said she would do it if her partner, Noah Baumbach, came too; she fell in love with the finished script and put herself forward to direct it.\n\n‘Even though it's about Barbie, it felt incredibly personal. Just as personal as anything else I've made,’ she says. Plot details are closely guarded, but we do know there are multiple refreshingly diverse Barbies living in a perfect world that Robbie’s Barbie comes to suspect may not be real, when her permanently arched feet fall flat and she worries about dying. (Close ups of Robbie-as-Barbie’s perpetual tip toes went viral earlier this year; those feet, ‘are like a bat signal,’ says Gerwig).\n\nLIA CLAY MILLER\n\n‘It starts off in a place where there is no aging, no death, no shame, no separation. That’s an oldie but a goodie. Because I went to Catholic school, that story of Eve and Adam suddenly realising they are naked really stuck with me,’ she says. She talks about John Milton's Paradise Lost, and the idea that there is no poetry without pain, one of many perhaps unexpected references — including Vincent Minelli’s An American in Paris, Jacques Tati's Mon Uncle and Powell and Pressburger’s Stairway to Heaven — she has brought to the project.\n\nIf you're an asshole on a Greta Gerwig set, there's no hope for you\n\nAs a director, Gerwig likes to foster a sense of security on set. 'Like you all step into the same shared dream,' she says. (‘If you're an asshole on a Greta Gerwig set, there's no hope for you,’ says the actor Simu Liu, who plays one of the Kens.) Hence the Barbie-themed sleepover before filming, where at least twelve Barbies plus America Ferrera (at the time of writing, Ferrera’s character is yet to be revealed) hung out; the Kens briefly popped over to play parlour games. Gerwig also encouraged the cast to bring their families to set. At one point, Ryan Gosling was chatting with her mum. ‘She just got right in there. He was like: “Your mom’s amazing.”’\n\nShe feels very much ‘in the middle everything’ in life, not least because she has just had a second baby (she also has a four-year-old son, Harold, and a stepson, who is 13). She retires to a private room to pump a bottle of breast milk, which is handed to her assistant, between the shoot and the interview. ‘I’m about to be 40,’ she says. ‘And there’s something about that where you’re like: Oh! I’m properly middle aged now.’ All parts of life feel extremely activated.’ She shows me a picture of her baby on her lap, at his four-month checkup the previous day. ‘He’s a little Schmoo. I don’t know if you can tell energy from the picture, but that’s very much his energy. He’s a wise little baby.’\n\nShe is incredibly upbeat and eloquent, which is all the more impressive when I learn that she isn’t sleeping much. ‘The little guy is sleeping through the night. But I'm still doing that thing where I wake up, every hour to 90 minutes, and just hover. You just keep wanting to look at that baby. So I'm slightly in a twilight state,’ she says. But you would never know she needs a nap as she talks me through her favourite designers (she loves the Rodarte sisters, Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, and she discovered Margaret Howell in London: ‘That stuff is primo!’) and her fear of department stores (‘I get overwhelmed because there's so much glass - too much reflective surface!’)\n\nI don’t want to be 80 and look back and say I could have really done it, from 40 to 60, but I chose to be practical!\n\nOn the Barbie set she wore the same boiler suit, in different colours, every day; she has long been a ‘uniform-seeker’. Now, she says, as she approaches her forties, ‘I want to start being more playfully outrageous.’ She talks about how fun it was to wear long nails and high heels for our shoot. ‘I don’t want to be 80 and look back and say I could have really done it, from 40 to 60, but I chose to be practical! But we will see how far I get with this,’ she says. Either way, it feels as though she is grabbing the current moment with both hands. ‘I'll probably look back and say, “That was a really an amazing time. And I don't know how all of it was possible.” But it’s filled with a lot of happiness.’\n\nLIA CLAY MILLER"

The influences include The Wizard of Oz, Rear Window, Pee-wee's Big Adventure, Singin' in the Rain, The Godfather, Oklahoma!, 2001, and Saturday Night Fever.\n\nThen, Saturday Night Fever, I always had a sense of wanting this to be a movie with an amazing soundtrack. Saturday Night Fever obviously has this incredible soundtrack by the Bee Gees. There's a documentary about the Bee Gees, and I'd seen it and was so touched by the Bee Gees, and I thought Barbie seemed so disco to me in her heart, because Barbie's sort of — and I will say this as a lover of Barbie and disco — a little bit dorky in the best way. Saturday Night Fever was a movie that was driven by music, but not a musical. I guess we're half of a musical."

        "text": "In the early 90s, according to a story that may now have become slightly mythologised in the retelling, the actor Sarah Polley – then aged 12 – was asked by Disney executives to remove a peace sign badge she was wearing. When she refused, Disney blacklisted her. This story lost a little of its potency last month with the announcement that Polley was set to direct the new “live-action” reboot of Bambi. For admirers of Polley’s determinedly independent career, the record-scratch noise could not be louder: this is somebody who worked with Atom Egoyan, David Cronenberg and Hal Hartley for God’s sake, before the age of 22.\n\nThoughts of Polley returned this week with the now-deafening noise surrounding the release of Barbie, directed by another former queen of independent cinema, Greta Gerwig. Coming up a few years after Polley, Gerwig was so indie that her films didn’t even go to Sundance, they went to South by Southwest. She was so indie that when she moved from micro-budget mumblecore movies to a scripted film with Noah Baumbach – Greenberg, in 2010 – the Guardian called it “her first tentative steps into the mainstream”. Greenberg was made for a budget of $25m, which it didn’t make back; now Gerwig has directed Barbie, for the film arm of mega-corporation Mattel, with a budget of $145m. Gerwig’s swerve into the actual mainstream prompts the question: does the phrase “selling out” have any meaning any more?\n\nGerwig and Polley are far from the only directors to have moved in this direction of late: Barry Jenkins, for instance, has now finished work on The Lion King sequel for Disney. Jenkins’s first feature film, Medicine for Melancholy, premiered at South by Southwest in 2008, the same year Greta Gerwig presented her directorial debut there – Nights and Weekends, co-directed with Joe Swanberg. (Incidentally, it’s interesting that so many articles now omit to credit that tiny, little-seen film as Gerwig’s first movie, preferring instead to reset her directorial career with the Oscar-nominated Lady Bird nearly 10 years later.) When Jenkins’ Moonlight won the Oscar for best picture in 2017, ABC News called it “the little film that could”; IndieWire asked “how a $1.5m indie landed eight Oscar nominations”. But did Moonlight triumph over the industry, or was it in fact the other way round?\n\nMattel and Disney are two enormous corporations that would seem to stand for everything these directors are – or should be – in opposition to. To anyone observing the state of cinema in 2023, it should be a point of utmost clarity that the might of these megabucks companies can do nothing but crush the smaller people. A recent article about Barbie in the New Yorker quoted no less a figure than Gerwig’s own agent as saying: “Is it a great thing that our great creative actors and film-makers live in a world where you can only take giant swings around consumer content and mass-produced products? I don’t know. But it is the business.” You don’t say.\n\nWhy has the concept of selling out lost so much of its cultural capital today? Online, you can hardly move for defenders of these directors, belligerently vaunting the fact that – for instance – Gerwig was influenced by directors such as Max Ophüls and Jacques Tati, as if that confers greater legitimacy on a film using IP (intellectual property) to make money for a toy company that sells vacuous, hypersexualised dolls. There’s a parallel here: the idea of Barbie dolls being in any way noxious seems, in the current climate, to be as hopelessly stick-in-the-mud a stance as the concept of selling out. The thought appears to be: look, the bad guys won, so we should all go along with it; since we’re all hypersexualised anyway, we might as well do it in a more egalitarian fashion; since the big corporations rule everything now, we might as well get people with a bit of artistic nous to be the face of their product.\n\nBut the recent writer and actor strikes in the US show that selling out is not just a question of personal ethics, but an industry-wide concern. A director’s decision to align themselves with these Goliaths of entertainment has consequences; makes money for the big guy, in opposition to fostering an industry where smaller films and creators have more opportunities. The activist and screenwriter of Don’t Look Up, David Sirota recently commented: “Quick reminder that literally not a single human being would pay any money to watch a movie/TV show written and acted by Bob Iger [the billionaire CEO of Disney] which means the resources that pay his entire zillion dollar salary are generated by writers and actors, not by him.” This is certainly true. For his part, former indie darling Mark Ruffalo, now known for being the Incredible Hulk, tweeted: “How about we all jump into indies now?”: this is in reference to the fact that certain independent films are exceptionally permitted to continue shooting by the striking union, Sag-Aftra. But the thing is, Ruffalo et al always could have made indies. That’s where he started out, after all, in films for directors such as Kenneth Lonergan – and where many of his colleagues still ply their trade; instead, his recent filmography has generated billions for Disney, via Marvel. Of course creators must seize what opportunities they can to create, within an increasingly compromised industry, but personal responsibility still exists; the actions of individuals have a knock-on effect.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Film Weekly Free newsletter Take a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mattel is planning films based on Barney the Dinosaur, He-Man and Polly Pocket – words to turn a film journalist’s hopes to ash – and alongside the new Bambi and Lion King films Disney has a plethora of walking-dead reboots of its old IP lined up, including a remake of The Aristocats by Questlove, the director of the independent documentary Summer of Soul. Barbie will most likely be as good and creative a film as it can be under the circumstances; odds-on that it will have the temerity to lightly poke fun at the doll and its billionaire patrons. But in the meantime, in a changing world for cinema, the struggle for the soul of cinema goes on."

There has been quite a hype for both these films as they feature superstars and intriguing storylines. Meanwhile, 'Barbie' recently had its world premiere in Los Angeles. Greta Gerwig, who directed and co-wrote the film, talked about the film at the event and also reacted to the clash with 'Oppenheimer'.\n\nadvertisement\n\nGRETA GERWIG ON 'BARBIE' VS 'OPPENHEIMER' CLASH\n\nBoth Margot Robbie-Ryan Gosling's 'Barbie' and Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer' will clash on July 21. Greta Gerwig addressed this 'Barbie' versus 'Oppenheimer' rivalry that has developed. “It’s all love — double up, double up twice,” she told The Hollywood Reporter. “I think you’ve got to see what the experience is, Barbie then Oppenheimer, Oppenheimer then Barbie. I think you’ve got to take all of the journeys,” she added.\n\nTalking about the film, she said, “We wrote it at such a specific time, in the midst of lockdown and everything else, and I was like, ‘I don’t even know if there’s going to be movies again, but if there are, let’s write the most outrageous, anarchic, hilarious thing, Let imaginary go out with a bang. It was something where I decided I had to direct it once the script was written and it was really like I just wanted to make that one, that was the one. So I was like if we can’t do it that’s fine, but I hope they let us.”\n\n#Barbie Director Greta Gerwig tells The Hollywood Reporter she always thought of Barbie's arched foot as a \"bat signal\" at the #BarbieMovie World Premiere pic.twitter.com/tizaBczQJ1 — The Hollywood Reporter (@THR) July 10, 2023\n\nABOUT 'BARBIE'\n\nMargot Robbie and Ryan Gosling will be seen in lead roles as Barbie and Ken now.

        "text": "No one predicted that Greta Gerwig would be the next filmmaker to bring C.S. Lewis’s Narnia to the screen. This week, however, it was revealed that the indie film darling is indeed currently on track to write and direct two film adaptations for Netflix. Production and release dates have not been set.\n\nWhile we wait to hear from her directly, this profile gives a brief overview of her career – highlighting notable quotes and connections that readers of the beloved Narnia books may find interesting.\n\n“Mumblecore”\n\nNights and Weekends (2008)\n\nGerwig first gained notoriety directing, writing, and appearing in several low-budget “mumblecore” films. She earned a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in Frances Ha (2012), which she co-wrote with director Noah Baumbach. To date, Gerwig and Baumbach have collaborated on four projects together.\n\nOscar Buzz\n\nLady Bird (2017)\n\nGerwig’s solo directorial debut, Lady Bird, received widespread critical acclaim. She earned Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay.\n\nThe film’s Sacramento Catholic high school setting mirrors Gerwig’s personal experience:\n\n“In high school, we took four years of theology, and ‘grace’ was explained to me as being ‘completely unexpected, holy, and deserved, but is something that can never be earned’ […] and there’s something deeply beautiful about that to me. Religion News\n\n“I have always been moved by the story of the denial of Peter. […] He is given the opportunity to repent through love. These stories have always informed my writing and my ideas, finding a larger universal truth behind what are so-called ‘small’ lives. Lady Bird denies where she is from, yes, but in the end, she also declares her love. We are granted the opportunity for grace, and we need love to accept it. Angelus News\n\nI always have some religious story threaded underneath that people can pick up on or not pick up on. I don’t need them to, but it helps me as an organizing principle because even if you don’t believe in the stories, they are very old stories, and they do speak really deeply to people and their psychologies and how they deal with life. The Washington Post\n\nNew Take on a Classic\n\nLittle Women (2019)\n\nNext Gerwig moved onto a more mainstream project, co-writing and directing another film adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s classic novel Little Women. The film received six Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nI hadn’t read it since I was 14 or 15, and then I happened to read it when I was 30, just because I thought I would re-love it. My experience with the book completely changed. First of all, there were things in the book that I hadn’t remembered at all. And there were things that seemed much spikier and stranger and more modern and very relevant… I said, “Oh, I’d like to make a film with this, because now I see this completely differently, and I think there’s something interesting here that is completely pressing to make a film about. Deadline\n\nGoing Big (and Pink)\n\nBarbie (2023)\n\nWith a budget of $100 million, Gerwig’s latest project is a far cry from her indie roots.\n\n“I’ve never been part of anything like [Barbie]. But in a funny way, it feels like the fundamentals are the same. Even though it is Barbie and it is an internationally known brand, the movie feels very personal. It feels just as intimate as Lady Bird or Little Women.” Rolling Stone\n\nRegarding the film’s vibrant color palette:\n\nI never wanted my adult taste to override what I loved as a kid. When I was eight years old, I loved the biggest, brightest, loudest, sparkliest thing that I could find. And I need to honor that even though I want the movie to be beautiful and delicious. I don’t want it to be overwhelmed with adult good taste, because that just feels disingenuous to what the task is. Rolling Stone\n\nNarnia\n\nAnd now… Greta Gerwig is preparing to be a temporary custodian of stories that mean so much to people around the world. C.S. Lewis’s Chronicles of Narnia have been translated into 47 languages.\n\nThere’s some movies I’d like to make that require a big canvas. I’ve seen so many directors move between bigger movies and smaller movies. […] I want to play in lots of different worlds. That’s the goal. Rolling Stone\n\nOh, by the way, she can use a sword…\n\nThe NarniaWeb team wholeheartedly wishes Greta all the best on this new journey!\n\nHere is everything we know about Netflix’s Narnia.\n\nNow that you know a little more about Greta Gerwig, how do you feel about her adapting Narnia for Netflix? Share your thoughts in the NarniaWeb discussion forums!"

        "text": "When Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird, Little Women) set out to direct Barbie — and write the screenplay with her partner, Noah Baumbach — she knew that LGBTQ+ inclusion would be a necessity. While actors Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling give life to the OG Barbie and Ken dolls, the film’s Barbieland is filled with Barbies and Kens that reflect the vibrant diversity of the real world — albeit a more colorful version with Dreamhouses, daily beach parties, and bops from divas like Lizzo, Dua Lipa, Nicki Minaj, Charli XCX, and Ava Max.\n\n“We are opening the doors to the Barbie universe,” Gerwig states in an email interview. “There’s no way we could have told this story without bringing in the LGBTQ+ community, and it was important for us to represent the diversity that Mattel has created with all of the different Barbies and Kens that exist today.”\n\nALEX in RAISA VANESSA Dress DAVID YURMAN, MISHO Rings CUYANA Earrings; SCOTT in GUCCI Jacket DIOR Shirt GUCCI Scarf SIEDRES Pants LOUBOUTIN Shoes; HARI in RODARTE Dress DAVID YURMAN Ring STUART WEITZMAN Shoes\n\nOut’s cover stars (and Barbieland residents), Hari Nef, Scott Evans, and Alexandra Shipp, all attest to the impact of the Mattel toy brand, which first launched in 1959 and has since grown into the most popular doll in the world. For many queer people, first encountering Barbie — her interchangeable accessories, her exaggerated femininity, her hunky boyfriend, Ken — would become a pivotal moment in their young lives. Barbie was a friend, a possibility, a glamorous vessel of pure fabulosity.\n\nOf course, Barbie also has a problematic past. The prototype’s blond hair, blue eyes, and surreally thin physique are emblematic of the unrealistic beauty standards society imposes on women. But Gerwig knew that the doll was far more than pretty plastic. And she wanted to capture that complexity in her Warner Bros. feature film.\n\n“Since Barbie has had a long history, we had to confront the criticisms head on,” Gerwig says. “We needed to get there before anyone else. Barbie has been equal parts painted a villain and a heroine. We point out and engage with the critics, and at the same time, we celebrate Barbie. She was the first adult doll people could play with. Barbie went to the moon before women could have credit cards. Barbie represents a lot of different things, but in a way, she was a stealthy advocate for women in the workplace and our achievements in society. There are definitely complications with Barbie, but it’s undeniable that she was at the vanguard of moving other things forward.”\n\nHARI NEF, ALEXANDRA SHIPP, SHARON ROONEY, ANA CRUZKAYNE, and EMMA MACKEY as Barbies in Warner Bros. Pictures’ \"BARBIE\"\n\nThe Oscar-nominated director, now 39, also felt a connection to Barbie from a young age — though she didn’t have the easiest time attaining one. “My mom wasn’t sold on Barbie, so I actually didn’t get my own doll for a while,” she recalls. “But all the girls in my neighborhood had them, so I was able to play with them when I would go over to their houses, and then when they would get tired of them, I would get them as hand-me-downs. But I have a real sense memory of standing in Toys ‘R’ Us looking at Barbie dolls and loving the ones that were in the big boxes. The ones with the big hair. It’s a very vivid, visceral memory of Barbie and what she meant. Finally, one Christmas, my mom caved and got me one. I was so excited.”\n\nAnother woman would bring an adult Gerwig back into Barbieland: her star, Margot Robbie (Bombshell, Birds of Prey), who is also a producer of the film. Robbie “invited me on this journey,” Gerwig recalls. “I love her work as an actor, and when we met and talked, I was deeply impressed by her work and viewpoint as a producer. I thought that I would love to make something with her. When she approached me and Noah to write Barbie, I jumped at the chance. Barbie is something everyone knows, all around the world, and everyone has an opinion of her. I couldn’t imagine a richer subject to try and tackle than something that comes with so much feeling already.”\n\nExperience the Barbie feeling more in the profiles of Nef, Evans, and Shipp. And don’t miss the Barbie movie, which comes out in theaters July 21.\n\nThis cover story is part of the Out July/August issue, out on newsstands July 4.

The actor has revealed how she was \"a real rule follower\" at school and \"had a ton of energy\". She talks about her mother, who wanted to sign her up for every activity.\"But as a kid, my mum was like, ‘Let’s sign her up for every activity.Let’s tire her out.’ I’ve always had a tremendous amount of enthusiasm. I was just interested in, like, everything. I had a really active imagination. I had a lot of really deep feelings. I was emotional,\" she told the media outlet.ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood. Kids with ADHD often have trouble focusing, and paying attention and have impulsive behaviors. As the symptoms advance, these kids find it difficult to cope at school and with friends.More than 350 million people globally have ADHD. The symptoms show up differently in different people making it difficult to identify the symptoms and get them diagnosed and treated. The signs of ADHD get overlooked easily.There are three types of ADHD: Predominantly Inattentive Presentation in which the individual forgets basic things and gets distracted easily, Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation in which it is difficult for the person to remain silent and sit still, Combined Presentation in which the individual shows both the types of symptoms.The US CDC lists the following as the common symptoms of ADHD: daydreaming, forgetting or losing things a lot, squirming or fidgeting, talking too much, making careless mistakes or taking unnecessary risks, having a hard time resisting temptation, having trouble taking turns and having difficulty getting along with others.There are several factors that increase an individual's risk for developing ADHD. While studies link genetic factors, other factors like brain injury, premature delivery and low birth weight increase the risk for this disorder. Exposure to lead and other environmental toxin and/ or consumption of alcohol and tobacco during pregnancy also increases the risk of the child developing ADHD."

        "text": "The Barbie movie is just around the corner, and moviegoers are eager to see Margot Robbie take on the role of Barbie and Ryan Gosling the role of Ken. The film was helmed by Lady Bird and Little Women director, Greta Gerwig, who cast a star-studded line-up of actors to play alongside Robbie and Gosling. Recently, Gerwig had a chat with The Guardian about Barbie, and she revealed she didn't initially tell her partner Noah Baumbach that she signed him up to be the movie's co-writer. During the interview, Gerwig also talked about organizing a sleepover with the cast before filming began.\n\nGerwig revealed that she planned a slumber party with Robbie, Issa Rae, and America Ferrera at Claridges, the London hotel. Together, they wore pajamas and played games. Some of the Ken actors were also invited but didn't spend the night. \"Honestly, it just felt like it would be the most fun way to kick everything off,\" Gerwig explained. \"And it's something you don't get to do that much as an adult. Like, 'I'm just going to go have a sleepover with my friends…'\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Gerwig has arranged something special for her actors. Before making Little Women, she had the four main cast members memorize poems and read them to each other. \"These were professional actors,\" Gerwig explained, \"But there was something about the fact they had to select a poem and then recite it... It was very intimate and amazing, and they were very vulnerable. It instantly felt helpful in creating that connection.\" She added, \"As a director, you have the job of dreaming up the movie, and then you have to get everyone else in the movie – hundreds of people – to have that same dream, too.\"\n\nWhat Is Barbie About?\n\nIn Barbie, to live in Barbie Land is to be a perfect being in a perfect place. Unless you have a full-on existential crisis. Or you're a Ken. From Oscar-nominated writer/director Greta Gerwig comes Barbie, which hits theaters on July 21st. Barbie stars Oscar-nominees Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Barbie and Ken, alongside America Ferrera, Kate McKinnon, Michael Cera, Ariana Greenblatt, Issa Rae, Rhea Perlman, and Will Ferrell. The film also stars Ana Cruz Kayne, Emma Mackey, Hari Nef, Alexandra Shipp, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Simu Liu, Ncuti Gatwa, Scott Evans, Jamie Demetriou, Connor Swindells, Sharon Rooney, Nicola Coughlan, Ritu Arya, Grammy Award-winning singer/songwriter Dua Lipa and Oscar-winner Helen Mirren. Gerwig directed Barbie from a screenplay by Gerwig & Oscar nominee Noah Baumbach, based on Barbie by Mattel."

        "text": "The lore that’s already been built up around Barbie has taught us that star Margot Robbie was instrumental from the very beginning in bringing the fashionable Mattel doll to the big screen. But apparently, co-star Ryan Gosling—who plays Ken—took a bit more convincing to join the project.\n\nTalking to Rolling Stone, Barbie director and co-writer Greta Gerwig explains that Gosling was her only choice for Ken, even though she’d never actually met him . “It was only ever Ryan Gosling, and it was a long journey. Margot and I just wouldn’t take no for an answer,” Gerwig said. “ From the moment that Margot came to me and I knew we were making this for Margot, I equally knew we were making this for Ryan. And I did not know Ryan at all. I’d never met him. I just was sure, and as soon as I thought of it, it made me so happy. Who else could do this? It’s some combination of Marlon Brando meets Gene Wilder meets John Barrymore meets John Travolta.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGerwig calls Gosling “a secretly comedic actor” who succeeds by taking comedy very, very seriously. “T he way we talked about Ken was as in-depth character work as I’ve ever done with anyone about anything ... I don’t know that anyone has ever invested more in making people understand the plight of this man. It was extraordinary,” Gerwig said. “ I felt with both of them that I might direct movies for a long time and never see anything that uniquely and gloriously unhinged.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHead to Rolling Stone to read the full interview, which also includes the tidbit that Gerwig is absolutely open to making a superhero movie— “ It would have to be something I had a feeling for and a relationship to”—even though she agrees Barbie is already sort of a superhero movie: “ It’s iconic in the same way. And it’s sort of mythic in the same way.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarbie opens July 21.\n\nWant more io9 news?

        "text": "Just over two weeks until its July 21 release, the fanfare shows no signs of slowing down. For those perplexed by all the excitement over a movie about a toy — even one that has spanned several generations — look no further.\n\nFor months, the hype surrounding Greta Gerwig’s live-action Barbie film has been building, thanks to a zealous marketing push, its popular director and star-studded cast, and a nonstop stream of memes.\n\nHere’s a guide to all the online buzz over the Barbie movie.\n\nThe memes: From ‘Barbenheimer’ jokes to Gerwig stanning\n\nAlmost immediately after the trailer and cast posters dropped, the Internet pounced on the meme-making opportunity, helping to boost its status early on. The “This Barbie/Ken” posters promoting the celebrity-packed cast — and the many professions or achievements of Barbie — served as the initial templates. (The movie stars Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken.)\n\nGet The Big To-Do Your guide to staying entertained, from live shows and outdoor fun to the newest in museums, movies, TV, books, dining, and more. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nThe movie’s social media team created a Barbie Selfie Generator that online jokesters, corporations including Dunkin’, and even agencies like the MBTA made use of. The messaging on the colorful movie poster — “She’s everything. He’s just Ken.” — also inspired a number of cultural references, among them movies like “Little Women” (also directed by Gerwig) and real-life couples, including Princess Diana and then-Prince Charles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the apparent campiness of the film has offered fertile ground for memes, perhaps the most popular have involved Barbie vs. Oppenheimer, an Internet phenomenon called “Barbenheimer.” Wildly different in tone and premise, the two movies are both opening on July 21, and many either are planning to see both (on the same day) or are fiercely loyal to just one. Either way, the crossover event has generated an endless supply of jokes, from how to schedule the day to merchandise. Even Gerwig and Robbie are on board.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother meme making the rounds touches on Gerwig’s nuanced depiction of girlhood and womanhood seen in her other works, such as “Lady Bird.”\n\nA cast and soundtrack overloaded with star power\n\nThe Barbie movie features so many well-known actors, comedians, and musicians, it’s easy to lose track of them in the pinkness of it all. Among those starring in the film include Robbie, Gosling, Simu Liu, Dua Lipa, Emma Mackey, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, Nicola Coughlan, Will Ferrell, America Ferrera, and Michael Cera (Helen Mirren serves as the narrator).\n\nThe soundtrack has an equally talented musical lineup — including Charli XCX, Nicki Minaj, and Haim — that has been teased for months. More “Barbies and Kens” (a.k.a. artists) are still to be announced, and the album will be released on vinyl.\n\nA finely curated soundtrack is one of the most important tools in Gerwig’s arsenal, with many of the scenes having specific musical cues, Rolling Stone reported. Robbie told the publication that the lyrics are “responding to what’s happening on-screen, so the music became ... a device to enhance what the audience was watching and experiencing.”\n\nRyan Gosling and Margot Robbie going all in on Barbie and Ken\n\nSome had doubts about Gosling as Ken, calling him “too old” at 42 to play the character (his defenders came out in full force). Gosling good-naturedly poked fun at the debate in an interview with GQ, calling it “funny — this kind of clutching-your-pearls idea of, like, #notmyken. Like you ever thought about Ken before this?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“If you ever really cared about Ken, you would know that nobody cared about Ken. So your hypocrisy is exposed. This is why his story must be told,” he joked.\n\nSince then, Gosling has seemingly won over the naysayers, with the actor fully embracing his “Ken-ergy” — he said Robbie and Gerwig “conjured this out of me somehow” — and encouraging others to do the same. The first movie clip released Monday, which shows Ken saying his job “is just beach,” also earned Gosling high praise for his comedic skills.\n\nRobbie, meanwhile, told Vogue that she was never a Barbie fan as a child and never imagined herself playing Barbie. But many have been unable to imagine anyone else playing the role, and Robbie has leaned into the character and its charms offscreen. Online, much attention has been given to her press tour outfits, designed after models of the toy including “Day to Night Barbie” and “Pink and Fabulous Barbie.”\n\nThe can’t-turn-your-eyes-away pinkness of it all\n\nThere’s a color called “Barbie Pink” for a reason. What would a Barbie movie be without Barbie Land and all of its bubbly Barbies and Kens awash in her signature color?\n\nFortunately, Rolling Stone has declared it “the pinkest movie ever.”\n\nThe color is bright, fun, and iconic — and Gerwig was keen on bringing her vision in all of its pink glory to life, telling Architectural Digest that she wanted “the pinks to be very bright, and everything to be almost too much.” Every aspect of the set is infused with the color. Sarah Greenwood, the production designer for the film, told the publication that construction caused an international shortage of the fluorescent shade of Rosco paint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven “Barbiecore,” the viral aesthetic trend inspired by the world of Barbie, is having a moment. Social media is abuzz with jokes and adoration for the color, with some planning on wearing all-pink outfits to see the movie.\n\nA robust press tour and marketing push capitalized on by brands\n\nThe driving force behind all of the hype surrounding the movie has undoubtedly been its aggressive, creative marketing campaign.\n\nThe publicity push is being credited with transforming a toy (and brand) that had lost its luster into something cool and trendy again.\n\nBy playing up Barbie’s nostalgia power and making much of the campaign interactive — from an immersive “World of Barbie” experience in Los Angeles, to the Barbie Boat Cruise in Boston and the Airbnb listing called “Barbie’s Malibu DreamHouse - Ken’s Way!” — fans have been able to take part in the fun. As brand strategist Moshe Isaacian explained in a lengthy Twitter thread, a number of brands have also partnered with the film, from Xbox to ALDO Shoes to Cold Stone Creamery and more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“When it comes to Barbie marketing I am but a pink cog in the capitalist machine,” a Twitter commenter quipped.\n\nThe enthusiasm generated by the marketing campaign has been boosted by the attention that the worldwide press tour is receiving. From Sydney to Seoul, the cast has met with fans, dressed for the occasion (especially Robbie), and brought Barbie Land with them. And to think, the movie isn’t even out yet.\n\n(The New Yorker reported that more movies based on Mattel toys are on the way).\n\nShannon Larson can be reached at shannon.larson@globe.com.

        "text": "The following article contains spoilers for Barbie.\n\nFor some, Barbie is the ultimate “girlboss” – she’s glamourous, successful and owns her own DreamHouse. For others, Barbie represents an outdated female stereotype – a “blonde bimbo girl in a fantasy world”, according to Aqua’s 1997 hit song Barbie Girl.\n\nJust ask the man with the megaphone stood outside the press screening of the new Barbie film that I attended in Leicester Square. Vehemently protesting the film, he insisted that Barbie is a bad role model and a danger to young women.\n\nBut Barbie fits perfectly into director Greta Gerwig’s repertoire of women-focused stories, which includes two Oscar-nominated coming of age films, Ladybird (2017) and Little Women (2019). Gerwig is a feminist filmmaker whose characters are curious, transgressive and rebel against their restrictive circumstances. Barbie is no exception.\n\nThe film follows Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie), whose perfect life in Barbieland is gradually falling apart because the humans playing with her in the real world are sad. Her arched Barbie feet become flat, she gets cellulite on her thighs and becomes troubled by thoughts of death.\n\nWith the help of Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) – comically styled as if a child “played with her too hard” – Stereotypical Barbie is tasked with entering the real world to find her human family and solve their problems.\n\nThe film opens with a parody of a famous scene from Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). The world is thrown into disarray when a giant Barbie doll lands in the desert like a UFO. Through Helen Mirren’s terrific narration, we are told that the inhabitants of this barren wasteland are a hoard of little girls who only have baby dolls to play with. The girls are liberated by the arrival of their exciting new friend and, tired of playing at being mothers, they smash up their bland baby dolls for good.\n\nThis opening positions Barbieland as a feminist utopia. In Barbieland, women can do anything: become president, win literary awards and throw fabulous parties.\n\nBarbie in the real world\n\nGerwig’s take on Barbie is timely. My research explores the recent feminist reclamation of the “bimbo” figure. On TikTok, the #Bimbo trend sees feminine-presenting content creators reclaiming the once derogatory “bimbo” label and aesthetic. Instead of abandoning femininity to succeed in a patriarchal society, bimbo feminism embraces femininity while supporting women’s advancement.\n\nIn the real world, Barbie is shocked to find that things are a little different than in Barbieland. She is harassed while roller skating and catcalled by male construction workers. A 2021 survey found that four-fifths of young women in the UK have been sexually harassed in public spaces. While Barbie says she feels “ill at ease” in these situations, Ken (Ryan Gosling) feels “admired”.\n\nWhen Barbie finds her human family, she is met with hostility from teenage daughter Sasha, who claims that Barbie is nothing more than a “professional bimbo” whose perfect body and privileged lifestyle have been making women feel bad about themselves for decades.\n\nLike real women, Barbie is faced with objectification and criticism. The film knows its audience and makes smart and accurate commentaries about women’s experiences.\n\nKen’s rights\n\nIn Barbieland, Barbie’s beach-dwelling boyfriend is “just Ken”. In the real world, he discovers a society where men reign supreme. It is not long before Ken’s endearing innocence is tainted by a concept that is novel where he comes from: patriarchy.\n\nKen becomes intoxicated by male dominance and the film takes every opportunity to lampoon it. Ryan Gosling excels in these comedy moments. At one point, Ken barges into a hospital and demands to perform surgery despite having no qualifications – other than being a man of course.\n\nBack in Barbieland, Ken enforces his own vision of patriarchy. Every night is “boys night”. Every Barbie exists to be ogled, serve beers and nurture men’s fragile egos. Under Ken’s rule, the former female president of Barbieland serves drinks to macho guys on the beach. The all-female Supreme Court are demoted to a cheerleading squad.\n\nIn her 2020 book Men Who Hate Women, founder of the Everyday Sexism project Laura Bates examines what she terms the “manosphere”. In other words, the many faces of radical misogyny in modern society, from men’s rights activists to incels.\n\nIn its portrayal of the Kens, Gerwig’s film confronts the manosphere head on. Much like the men who are indoctrinated into these radical groups, the Kens are led to believe that their rights are being eclipsed by women’s and find themselves conforming to toxic male stereotypes to regain a sense of control.\n\nGerwig’s Barbie does a stellar job of exposing how damaging patriarchal ideology is to society. While the film obviously appeals to women, it is men who really need to watch it. Barbie makes a point that Leicester Square-megaphone-man really needs to hear: it’s not a Barbie doll that threatens women’s rights, opportunities and safety – it’s the patriarchy.\n\nBarbie is one of the most surprising and daring films of the year. What could have been a frivolous flop succeeds in being a substantial, important and poignant piece of filmmaking – as well as tremendous fun to watch.\n\nLooking for something good?

It's as if my childhood playroom was brought to life with all the giant pink Dreamhouses arranged in a cul-de-sac. They have no walls so that the Barbies can wave to each other. Many of the hand-made objects look plastic, like the toothbrushes with the squiggles of toothpaste resting on top. Inside, the Dreamhouse has modernist furniture from the 1950s and 1960s, referencing the time of Barbie's inception.\n\nOne of the best parts of the whimsical design is the fridge. Some of the plastic containers, like the containers of food and milk, are real but the back is just a decal — hand-painted images of delicious cookie dough or soda cans. Margot Robbie praised the film's playful visual style:\n\n\"It is intentionally 2D ... we want things to be obviously artificial but still very satisfying ... Even though it's fake, it's really beautiful, which is kind of like everything in Barbieland.\"\n\nBarbie's pool is also fake, just like the sticker on your Dreamhouse toy that created the illusion of water. There are no water or fire elements in Barbieland, so she doesn't actually shower, either. As Barbie, Margot Robbie will slide down and gently step onto her pool. She said that the crew often walked around the shiny blue water because it seems so real.\n\nBarbie also has a gorgeous mailbox shaped like a flamingo. Inside, the letters are gibberish, reflecting the writing of children. Such small details indicate how much thought and care Gerwig put into this film. Each shot is a confectionary visual delight, and there is so much to see."

        "text": "Barbie is one of the most awaited films of the year. The Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie starrer movie has created a lot of buzz even before its release. The first reaction was out a few days ago and people are definitely loving the film, which has garnered attention for its unique setup as well as the number of Barbies and Kens. As the anticipation grows, we got a chance to sit down with Ken aka Simu Liu, and set decorator Katie Spencer for a chat. During the interaction, we got to know a lot about what went on behind the scene as well as how beautifully the movie was shot.\n\nSimu Liu talks about his character as well as director Greta Gerwig\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Pinkvilla, Simu Liu shared the insights of playing the role of Ken and how he came about it.\n\nI mean, just really, really incredible. I mean, Greta is someone that I've admired for so long. She's one of those like just really smart, unique filmmakers. And hearing that she was gonna do a project like Barbie, I think it made a lot of people really, really excited about it. And you know, that, that's before I even met her, by the way. And actually getting to be on set with her and work with her, um, It's just incredible. She's so collaborative. I think the most important thing for actors is that they feel like they're heard and, they feel like it's a safe space to try things and to throw ideas out. And Greta's so good at just kind of creating that space and, there's a, a patience and a kindness with her that. And, it's just so special to be able to, you know, go through that process and that journey with her and Margot. By the way, it's such an exceptional, you know, she's not just an actress, but the producer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYeah, that's a really good question. Cause Shang doesn't really dress that well. Yeah. Let's be, let's be honest. Yeah. His sense of fashion is, is a little bit lacking. I think he would look at Ken and be like, wow, that guy dresses really well. He'd be like, first of all, that guy dresses really well. Second, his hair is always so perfect. Yeah. And third, why does he kind of look like me? I think those would be the three things going through. It's not fine.\n\nYou know granted it was very deliberate in the way that Greta showed Barbie land. I think Barbie land needed to feel like it was a place for everyone from the cast to the other dancers. Everybody inhabiting that world. Um, it's, it's meant to be inclusive and it's meant to be, meant to show the world for, for what it is.\n\nI think yeah, unsurprising that, you know, when you look at our cast of Barbies and Kens that, we're definitely reflective of that. I think it's a big, you know, it's big, it speaks very well of a company like Mattel. Also especially in the last few years, really pivoting from this very kind of Eurocentric, white-centric version of what Barbie is. This very narrow definition to like really opening up what Barbie means and what Barbie can look like, you know, and yeah, I guess what Ken can look like too.\n\nIt's so funny that you mentioned, well, I mean, first of all, I have to, I have to say like, RRR this year was so phenomenal. Um, it was absolutely incredible. And, it blew me away. There are a lot of similarities between I think Barbie and Bollywood.\n\nThere's, you know, just the focus on musicality. There's such music, songs like singing and dancing, like, you know, the actors are, are performing and they're singing and there have to be such triple threats and yeah, I feel like, um, you know, I feel like it's such a natural thing for an actor to look at Bollywood and to want to, you know, want to kind of participate and want to be a part of it in some way.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm putting it out there. I want to be in a Bollywood movie. I wanna be part of a b a Bollywood dance number. Um, So I really wanna make it happen.\n\n\n\nALSO READ: Barbie: Why is Margot Robbie starrer getting banned in Vietnam? Details inside\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarbie set decorator Katie Spencer spills the beans on behind the scenes\n\nIt always starts with the script. And obviously, Greta and Noah wrote this incredible script. It's just, You're on a journey you can't imagine. But it was always more about the script than anything else. Greta is so passionate when she talks about things and also cuz she's an actress, you know, she acts things out. So you feel like you are there.\n\nI never had a Barbie when I was growing up. I never had one right? In the UK we had something called Cindy, but we can't talk about that. But, so I never had a Barbie. So what we did, we bought, um, a Barbie dreamhouse from Amazon to have a look at it. Cause everybody knows what the Barbie doll is like, but the Dreamhouse is a little bit something. And looking at that was an amazing breakthrough cuz you look at it and see how children play with dolls. You know, things like that. There are no walls in the house, you know, there are no stairs. You could just float through and do whatever you like. It was about, the scale of items, within that space.\n\nSome things were out of scale, like the hairbrush. But of course, Margot is human size. It's not Lord of the Ring, so we're not shrinking her or doing anything like that. So everything can be made like the car or anything like the choices we made were quite small. Because Barbie lives in a world approximately 23% smaller than the one we live in. And then of course you bring in the color pink. Yeah. And that's a whole different story.\n\nIt was a very abrasive thing and what we like to do, Sarah (production designer) and I, we do like a show and tell, which is we have this big sort of prop store and everything. And we did a show and tell for Barbie and for Ken and they came down because the more that you can involve the actors, the more the better, whatever film you are doing because their environment is so important. So, yes, every step of the way, we said, what about, you happy with this? From Greta, Sarah, and me, Rodrigo, Jacqueline, Ivan, and the actors, everybody had to be on the same page to make this peculiar world work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's interesting having been on this sort of Barbie boot camp right, and getting to know all the Barbies. Let's have one Barbie as a writer. One Barbie is a painter. You know something aspirational and something enjoyable. So thinking of those characters and thinking how to say it, because like in Barbie land, there's no water, right? There's no paper, there's no electricity. So when you get to see, you'll see that all the newspapers and all the books are solid like a toy. You know, there's no proper writing about it. A bit of a toy. Just writing is just a squiggle. So there were huge challenges there. Yeah. And then how they would interact and then with Greta's script. So yeah, I would think this is probably the most challenging film we've ever done.\n\nI would like for the audience to come out visually. There are lots of other things I could tell you, but if I was to take, um, one, it is the power of color. I think the message is, I think go with your expectations. Open it. Think you're going to see this and you are okay. And then hopefully you'll go, God, that was it. But you will have the best time in the cinema.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout Barbie\n\nBarbie, directed by Greta Gerwig is all set to release on July 21, 2023. The movie stars Ryan Gosling, Margot Robbie, Simu Liu, Alexandra Shipp, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Hari Nef, Scot Evans, Kate McKinnon, Sharon Rooney, Dua Lipa, Nicola Coughlan, Ana Cruz Kayne, Issa Rae, and more.\n\nALSO READ: Margot Robbie channelises her inner Barbie at press tour; Dresses up like vintage dolls"

        "text": "Barbie Land just got a little smaller.\n\nThe highly-anticipated “Barbie” has been banned in Vietnam over the inclusion of the “nine dash line map” depicting islands in the South China Sea as being controlled by Beijing. Vietnamese politicians claim the map violates its sovereignty.\n\nVi Kien Thanh, director general of the Vietnam Cinema Department under the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism, announced that “Barbie” will not be allowed to commercially screen in the nation, as decided by the National Film Evaluation Council.\n\n“We do not grant license for the American movie ‘Barbie’ to release in Vietnam because it contains the offending image of the nine-dash line,” the state-run Tuoi Tre newspaper stated, citing Thanh (via Variety).\n\nPrevious films “Uncharted” and “Abominable” were similarly banned in Vietnam for the same cause, as well as series “Madam Secretary,” “Pine Gap,” and “Put Your Head On My Shoulder.”\n\nThe United Nations ruled unanimously against the validity of the “nine dash line” map in 2016, but China has stated it does not recognize the U.N.’s decision.\n\n“Barbie” lead star and producer Margot Robbie previously shared that upon first reading director Gerwig’s script for the live-action Mattel film, she was shocked it could even get made.\n\n“The first time I read the ‘Barbie’ script, my reaction was, ‘Ah! This is so good. What a shame it will never see the light of day,'” Robbie said earlier this year, “‘because they are never going to let us make this movie.’ But they did.”\n\nScreenwriter Gerwig admitted it felt like “vertigo” to pen the movie alongside collaborator Noah Baumbach. “Where do you even begin? What would be the story?” Gerwig recalled wondering. “I think it was that feeling I had that it would be really interesting terror. Usually, that’s where the best stuff is. When you’re like, ‘I am terrified of that.’ Anything where you’re like, ‘This could be a career-ender,’ then you’re like, ‘OK, I probably should do it.'”\n\nFor all the details on “Barbie,” click here."

Speaking with ET's Will Marfuggi, Gerwig responded to growing speculation surrounding a potential Ken-focused spin-off.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm just focused on getting this one out and crossing all my fingers and toes,\" she said. \"And then we'll see what happens after that.\"\n\nBarbie hits theaters on Friday, July 21.\n\nMeanwhile, it was recently reported that Gerwig has signed on to helm two of the upcoming Narnia films for Netflix. The director told ET on Sunday that she's more focused on a major personal milestone, first.\n\n\"On Aug. 4th, I turn 40,\" she shared with a laugh, \"and this movie's out. So I'm like, I gotta turn 40 and get this movie out, and then I'll figure out what happens next.\"\n\nAs for how she'll ring in her birthday, Gerwig joked she's planned \"a huge dance party.\"\n\nNo doubt Gerwig picked up some moves while shooting Barbie with her talented cast, who put on an epic choreographed dance number in what promises to be one of the film's memorable scenes.\n\n\"Everyone was, like, just so happy to be there,\" Gerwig recalled. \"I think we could have kept shooting this movie for another three months, and they would have just been like, 'Great! Let's learn new choreography and do it again.\"\n\nAxelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic\n\nRobbie, who also served as a producer on the project, told ET that there's a lot she and Gerwig hope viewers are able to take away from the experience of watching the movie.\n\n\"We want, more than anything, for everyone to kind of have the experience they want to have. You can take so much from this film,\" she said. \"It can be a wild carnival ride or it can hit you in some pretty emotional places.\"\n\n\"I think kids are gonna be kind of dazzled by the world of it all and I think adults are gonna really see themselves in some of the characters,\" she added with a smile.\n\nGosling also spoke with ET at the star-studded event, gushing over Robbie's tireless work promoting the film.\n\n\"I think it's all been incredible, everything, the whole way. Margot has produced this film and built this film, structured the process, created the environment for all of us,\" Gosling shared, before gesturing at the elaborate premiere -- which included a pink carpet, a Barbie dream car, and a general sense of fun and whimsy. \"I mean, this is an indication of what it was like to shoot [the movie].\"\n\nHe added, \"She created this, she's made it come true in every way, and it's brilliant.\"\n\nSee more of ET's coverage from the Barbie premiere below.\n\nGet the ET Newsletter Sign up By signing up, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy\n\nRELATED CONTENT:"

Or have certain conservative clowns picked up on the subtext of the scene in the \"Barbie\" trailers where Kate McKinnon's Weird Barbie implores Margot Robbie's Barbara Millicent Roberts to strap on a pair of Birkenstocks and journey to the real world to deal with her sudden existential crisis? No, it's another (albeit related) moment in the trailers that's caused a stir: a shot revealing the \"Real World Map\" that McKinnon's character provides to Robbie's Barbie to help her on her personal odyssey.\n\nThis map, which you can see in the below image, is about as accurate a representation of our planet's geography as Wes Anderson's \"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\" is as a portrayal of deep-sea life. (Clearly, Gerwig and her production team should've consulted Cartographer Barbie on the matter.) Nevertheless, its depiction of the Asian continent has resulted in the film being banned in Vietnam. I'll leave it to Variety to explain the situation:"

        "text": "Photos courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures; Melinda Sue Gordon/Universal Pictures\n\nOne of the most hotly debated head-to-head box office match-ups of the year is just four weeks away. While much could change over the next month, here’s how Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer are shaping up in preliminary tracking.\n\nBarbie\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures\n\nJuly 21, 2023 (WIDE)\n\nOpening Weekend Range: $55M-$85M\n\nDomestic Total Range: $120M-$226M\n\nPROS:\n\nBarbie has been a remarkable performer across the social media spectrum thanks to a vocal fan base and meme-driven activity across TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and other platforms.\n\nAs a generational brand, Barbie has strong appeal to women of various ages and should benefit from the voice of director and co-writer Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird, Little Women) and the presence of A-Listers Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as the leads.\n\nOutside of The Little Mermaid, very few of this summer’s tentpole films are catering so directly to women, leaving Barbie positioned for a strong performance courting an under-served audience. Early sales reflect this with, with Barbie’s day-one pre-sales coming in 46 percent higher than Mermaid‘s comparable period.\n\nCONS:\n\nIt’s challenging at this stage to determine to what extent online and fandom buzz will translate to real world interest. That’s especially true given the film’s seemingly more mature focus; its satirical comedy bent could put a ceiling on family turnout relative to the broader multi-generational appeal of The Super Mario Bros. Movie.\n\nPremium screen footprints will be very low for Barbie, with other films dominating that space throughout July. That not only lowers Barbie‘s potential average ticket prices, but—as audiences increasingly favor a premium viewing experience—could have a negative impact on attendance.\n\nWhile early pre-sales are strong for previews on Wednesday and Thursday, it remains to be seen whether or not the film will be able to gain traction outside the die-hard fan base in the weeks ahead.\n\nOppenheimer\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\nJuly 21, 2023 (WIDE)\n\nOpening Weekend Range: $40M-$55M\n\nDomestic Total Range: $137M-$187M\n\nPROS:\n\nDirector Christopher Nolan himself is a reliable box office draw, as shown in the post-Dark Knight era of his career with the success of Dunkirk, Interstellar, and Inception.\n\nCounter-programming potential is strong, with Oppenheimer being one of the few thrillers aimed squarely at adults to receiving a massive marketing push in this day and age.\n\nThere’s minimal direct competition moving into the late summer, with most of the wide releases coming to theaters in Oppenheimer‘s first few holdover frames being family-friendly movies.\n\nPre-sales are popping at this stage, with initial models pointing to preview results ahead of last summer’s Nope and Nolan’s own Dunkirk. General moviegoer interest prompted by strong word of mouth from preview audiences could create long-term backloading weeks into the film’s theatrical run—particularly as many seek out IMAX and other PLFs for this particular film.\n\nCONS:\n\nOppenheimer‘s three-hour runtime puts even more emphasis on word of mouth—especially given the fact that, while containing a spectacle component, it looks to be Nolan’s most strictly narrative-driven film since The Prestige in 2006.\n\nMen over the age of 25 will be the primary crowd here, and that’s a source of crossover competition with Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, opening one week earlier.\n\nNolan’s Tenet, released under abnormal pandemic-era circumstances, was one of the more divisive films of his career, earning a 76 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nLong Range Box Office Forecast & 2023’s Upcoming Calendar\n\n(as of 6/23/23)\n\nRelease Date Title 3-Day (FSS) Opening Low/High Range Pinpoint % Chg from Last Week Domestic Total Low/High Range Pinpoint % Chg from Last Week Distributor 6/30/2023 Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny $68,000,000 – $95,000,000 -9% $211,000,000 – $325,000,000 Disney / Lucasfilm 6/30/2023 Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken $12,000,000 – $17,000,000 -10% $35,000,000 – $62,000,000 -10% Universal / DreamWorks Animation 7/7/2023 Insidious: The Red Door $24,000,000 – $29,000,000 -7% $54,000,000 – $66,000,000 -7% Sony Pictures / Screen Gems 7/7/2023 Joy Ride $11,000,000 – $16,000,000 -10% $35,000,000 – $60,000,000 -10% Lionsgate 7/12/2023 Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One $65,000,000 – $80,000,000 $250,000,000 – $320,000,000 Paramount Pictures 7/14/2023 PSYCHO-PASS: Providence (Limited) Sony / Crunchyroll 7/14/2023 Theater Camp (Limited) Disney / Searchlight Pictures 7/21/2023 Barbie $55,000,000 – $85,000,000 $120,000,000 – $226,000,000 Warner Bros.

        "text": "Barbie director Greta Gerwig had some very specific instructions for Ryan Gosling for his crying scenes in the film: Cry like a 4 y/o.\n\nCrying on-screen can't be easy, and you have to wonder what actors are thinking when they are doing so. Ryan Gosling plays Ken in the upcoming Barbie film, and the demands director Greta Gerwig had for him when crying are interesting, to say the least.\n\nIn The New Yorker's recent feature on Barbie, they revealed that Gerwig told Gosling to “cry the way her four-year-old son cries” for his crying scenes in the film. It remains to be seen how well this advice worked for Gosling in the film, but we now know that when he cries in Barbie, it will sound similar to how Gerwig's actual young son sounds when he cries.\n\nBarbie is the upcoming film based on the famous Mattel dolls. Margot Robbie stars as the titular doll as she embarks on a journey of self-discovery with Ken after being expelled from Barbie Land. In addition to Robbie and Gosling playing their iconic dolls, Dua Lipa, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Simu Liu, and John Cena are just a few of the names of actors playing different variants of the dolls.\n\nRyan Gosling is an accomplished director who has been selective with his projects in recent years. After First Man, he went on an acting hiatus before starring in The Gray Man — an action-thriller from the Russo brothers for Netflix. He starred in the film with Chris Evans, Ana de Armas, Jessica Henwick, and Regé-Jean Page. Aside from Barbie, Gosling's next big role will come in The Fall Guy — Bullet Train director David Letch's next film.\n\nBarbie will be released on July 21."

        "text": "Greta Gerwig's Barbie could open to anywhere near $80 million or even more on its first day in theatres. The film stars Margot Robbie in the title role and Ryan Gosling as Ken. Meanwhile, Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer starring Cillian Murphy has a shot at $50 million in its box office debut. Both films, two of the year's most-anticipated movies, will be released on July 21. Also read: Here's what Tom Cruise has to say about the clash between Oppenheimer and Barbie Margot Robbie plays Barbie in Greta Gerwig's upcoming film.\n\nAs per a recent report, together Barbie and Oppenheimer promise a near-$200 million weekend at the US box office over July 21-23. While the buzz around Greta Gerwig's star-studded live-action movie Barbie continues to grow as fans gear up for its premiere next month, Oppenheimer is a more serious drama about the origin of the atomic bomb.\n\nStay tuned with breaking news on HT Channel on Facebook. Join Now\n\nMargot Robbie in Barbie (left) and Cillian Murphy in a still from Oppenheimer.\n\nOpening day box office predictions\n\nWhile Warner Bros conservatively is saying $60 million, as per a new Deadline report, Barbie's opening day collection is the 'start of $80 million minimum'. The report added that this, too, is 'a tampered-down expectation because Barbie on paper has all the glitz for a potential $100 million start'.\n\nApart from Barbie presales, the reports also touched upon Oppenheimer's box office predictions saying a ‘$40 million-to-possible $50 million opening’ is expected for the Christopher Nolan film. Comparing the two films, the report quoted one distribution insider as saying, “It’s (Oppenheimer is) as much male and older as Barbie is female and younger.”\n\nThe report added that the rest of the near-$200 million weekend over July 21-23 will also include the $35 million collection from the second weekend of Tom Cruise-starrer Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One. The film is scheduled to be released on July 12.\n\nMargot Robbie, Greta Gerwig promote Oppenheimer\n\nOn Friday, Robbie and Gerwig shared three images of themselves standing in front of film posters holding tickets for the Tom Cruise-starrer Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One as well as James Mangold’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer.\n\nSharing the pictures from Barbie the movie's official Twitter account, they said in the caption, “Mission: Accepted!”\n\nAbout Barbie\n\nAfter Warner Bros. unveiled a first look at the film and its release date on Twitter in April 2022, fans immediately began to speculate what they could expect from the forthcoming Barbie movie.\n\nIn the irreverent comedy, Barbie (Margot Robbie) and Ken (Ryan Gosling) venture beyond the perfect, pink, plastic dreamland they share with dozens of other Barbies and Kens, and find themselves in the real world, much to the annoyance of a Mattel executive played by Will Ferrell.\n\nOppenheimer\n\nChristopher Nolan, known for films such as Tenet, Interstellar, Inception and The Prestige, has directed Oppenheimer. This marks the first time he has made a biopic of a real person – J Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), the theoretical physicist, who helped develop the first nuclear weapons.\n\nEmily Blunt will be seen as his wife with a supporting cast that includes Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon and Florence Pugh."

        "text": "New York CNN —\n\nGreta Gerwig’s “Barbie” raked in a stunning $155 million domestically over the weekend, giving the film the largest opening weekend of 2023 and the biggest-ever debut for a female director.\n\nThe combined release of “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer,” dubbed “Barbenheimer,” has become a pop culture sensation – and one that might revive a struggling movie industry.\n\nBarbenheimer was the fourth highest-grossing industry weekend of all time in North America, totaling $302 million Sunday. Analysts believe it will grow even more when final numbers are reported Monday.\n\nComing in behind “Barbie,” “Oppenheimer” opened at $80.5 million domestically over the weekend, according to Comscore. Both movies essentially doubled predictions from weeks ago, Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore, said.\n\nIt’s unprecedented to not only have two films do so well, but also to help each other with the Barbenheimer trend, Dergarabedian said.\n\n“I can’t really think of any parallels ever,” Dergarabedian said. “Where both movies became bigger because of each other.”\n\nIt’s also a tale of two trajectories, Dergarabedian said, between a commercial blockbuster and a three-hour historical drama.\n\n“Both can be considered absolute homerun hits, and both are gonna perform in the coming weeks in a different way,” Dergarabedian said.\n\nThe two movies can enjoy a summer with little competition, particularly “Barbie” since there haven’t been female-driven blockbusters since “The Little Mermaid.”\n\n“Barbie” took in $70.5 million in North American theaters Friday, including the Thursday pre-shows.\n\nFrom left, Gabrielle Roitman, Kayla Seffing, Maddy Hiller and Casey Myer take a selfie in front of an \"Oppenheimer\" movie poster before they attended an advance screening of \"Barbie\" on Thursday in Los Angeles. Chris Pizzello/AP\n\nThe movie has made the biggest domestic start for a female-directed movie. Its closest comparison is “Wonder Woman” in 2017, directed by Patty Jenkins, which raked in about $38 million domestically on opening day, according to Box Office Mojo. “Captain Marvel,” co-directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, brought in about $62 million.\n\n“Barbie” was distributed by Warner Bros., owned by CNN’s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nPreview showings of “Barbie” brought in $22.3 million, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe Mattel doll film beat “Oppenheimer,” which earned $33 million on Friday – also an impressive feat.\n\nIt’s a win for director Christopher Nolan, surpassing many of his previous hits: “Inception” brought in around $22 million on opening day and “Dunkirk” $20 million, though it didn’t reach opening day numbers for “The Dark Knight” and “The Dark Knight Rises.”\n\nThis kind of foot traffic can be expected for big Marvel or Star Wars movies, Boxoffice Pro chief analyst Shawn Robbins said. It’s a big signal to studios that they don’t have to play it safe all the time, he said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Why does it matter that Barbie is on her tiptoes? 04:30 - Source: CNN\n\n“When you have two highly anticipated movies, they’re counterprogramming in a lot of ways and not cannibalizing each other,” Robbins said. “They can succeed at the same time.”\n\nBefore “Barbie,” “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” had the biggest opening of 2023 at $146.3 million domestic.\n\nA social media driven campaign to see both movies led to a double-feature Barbenheimer phenomenon. That could bring a much needed rebound to the movie industry. Summer releases from earlier in the season, such as ‘Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’ drew underwhelming box office numbers on opening weekend, drawing $60 million in the United States and $70 million internationally.\n\n“Everything about this movie and the toy is fun,” Sheri Lambert, a marketing professor at Temple University told CNN. “I think people are looking to escape.”\n\nMattel is also not new to nostalgia marketing, making people “really excited” about movies that take them back to the past, Lambert added."

        "text": "The summer box office just went nuclear.\n\nFilmmaker Greta Gerwig‘s female-fueled Barbie opened to a historic $162 million domestically, a threshold usually reserved for male-driven superhero fare or marquee IP, such as the final Harry Potter movie. It came in well ahead of an expected $90 million to $110 million and helped fuel one of the biggest weekends in history. And the final figure of $162 million was even ahead of Sunday’s already-stupendous $155 million.\n\nBarbie — which brings to life Mattel’s iconic fashion doll — is also strutting to big numbers overseas. The pic launched to an impressive $194.3 from 70 markets for a dazzling global debut of $356.3 million against a $145 million production budget (similar to domestic, Monday actuals were ahead of Sunday estimates). It scored the biggest opening ever for a WB title in major markets, including Mexico ($22.3 million), Brazil ($15.9 million) and Australia ($14.6 million). The U.K. led with $22.9 million, the biggest showing for the studio since the pandemic. Barbie wasn’t expected to make a big splash in Asian markets, although it did do better than expected in China, with $8.2 million.\n\nIn North America, Barbie scored the biggest domestic start ever for a movie directed by a woman, solo or otherwise. The solo crown previously belonged to Patty Jenkins’ Wonder Woman, which started off with $103.3 million domestically in 2017. In 2019, the Anna Boden- and Ryan Fleck-directed Captain Marvel opened to $153 million.\n\nBarbie also set a slew of other records, including landing the top opening of 2023 to date, ahead of The Super Mario Bros. Movie ($146.3 million). The next closest 2023 launch belonged to Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse ($120.7 million), followed by Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 ($118.4 million) and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania ($106.9 million). Otherwise, many releases haven’t been able to inch past the $100 million mark.\n\nIt also marks the biggest opening for Barbie stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, the biggest three-day opening for a movie based on a toy — eclipsing Transformers: Dark of the Moon ($115.9 million) — and Warners’ biggest opening for a non-DC pic or a sequel.\n\nGerwig’s film towered over Christopher Nolan‘s Oppenheimer, the weekend’s other new wide release.\n\nNot that Oppenheimer, from Universal, is any slouch. The three-hour, R-rated historical drama about J. Robert Oppenheimer and the making of the atomic bomb likewise came in well ahead of expectations with $82.4 million (that’s up from Sunday’s estimate of $80.5 million). That’s the filmmaker’s third-biggest domestic debut behind The Dark Knight Rises ($160.9 million) and The Dark Knight ($158.4 million), not adjusted for inflation. It also will come in ahead of recent summer pics including The Flash, Elemental and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.\n\nBarbie is skewing heavily female, or 68 percent, while Oppenheimer is male-dominated (64 percent). The performance of Oppenheimer was almost more surprising to some than Barbie, considering its running time and topic.\n\nOther stats: Oppenheimer ranks as the third-biggest opening ever for a biographical film in North America behind American Sniper ($89.3 million) and The Passion of the Christ ($83.8 million), not adjusted for inflation.\n\nOverseas, Oppenheimer launched with a strong $98 million from 78 markets, up from Sunday’s estimate of $93.7 million. The film was Nolan’s biggest non-superhero opening in no fewer than 55 markets. The film’s global start is $180.4 million against a $100 million production budget.\n\nHeading into the weekend, tracking suggested Nolan’s film would start off with a solid $50 million domestically.\n\nThe one-two punch of Barbie and Oppenheimer — a phenomenon dubbed “Barbenheimer” — was a needed boost for moviegoing and the box office, which has yet to recover fully from the pandemic. This will be the first three-day weekend in history when one movie earns $100 million or more and another $50 million or more.\n\nRevenue-wise, this is the fourth-biggest weekend of all time and the biggest since Avengers: Endgame, according to Comscore, with combined ticket sales hitting $311.1 million in a rare feat. The sizzling box office is a welcome respite from the ongoing writers and actors strike, which has brought Hollywood to a standstill and sparked worry among theaters owners that studios will begin moving their fall and winter releases if actors can’t promote their films.\n\nBoth Barbie and Oppenheimer were graced with A CinemaScores from audiences in the U.S., and their critics’ scores on Rotten Tomatoes store aren’t far apart — 90 percent versus 93 percent, respectively.\n\nCinemark, one of the country’s largest theater circuits, said the two films fueled the exhibitor’s biggest summer weekend of all time.\n\n“People love coming together to experience great storytelling in a movie theater, as proven yet again by the sheer volume of consumers who visited our locations to see Barbie and Oppenheimer during opening weekend,” said Cinemark chief marketing and content officer Wanda Gierhart Fearing. “It appears Barbie actually is everything, and Christopher Nolan fans turned out in droves to see his newest masterpiece in the larger-than-life theatrical format that he intended. Congratulations to our studio partners, as well as the entire creative community for delivering films that generate these record-breaking results.”\n\nBarbenheimer isn’t making life easy for Tom Cruise starrer Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning, Part One. The film tumbled a steep 65 percent to $19.4 million for a domestic total of $118.6 million. It held up better overseas, where it earned another $55 million from 72 markets for a foreign tally of $252.1 million and $370.9 million globally.\n\nParamount’s seventh Mission: Impossible film had to contend with losing Imax screens to Oppenheimer in addition to losing other premium large format screens to either Oppenheimer or Barbie. The upcharge for Imax and premium large-format screens is significant and can have a big impact on the bottom line.\n\nAngel Studios’ faith-based political thriller Sound of Freedom enjoyed another strong weekend. And, in the U.S., it beat narrowly Dead Reckoning with $19.9 million for a cume of $124.4 million, ahead of MI7.\n\nSound of Freedom stars The Passion of the Christ’s Jim Caviezel as the real-life Tim Ballard, who worked as an agent for the Department of Homeland Security before embarking on his own quest to bring child traffickers to justice. While the conservative-leaning Sound of Freedom has been discussed on QAnon message boards, Angel says it isn’t a QAnon movie. In late 2021, Caviezel spoke at a QAnon convention in Las Vegas, where he invoked the QAnon slogan, “The storm is upon us.”\n\nJuly 23, 7:25 a.m.: Updated with weekend estimates.\n\nJuly 23, 9:20 a.m.: Updated with foreign estimates.\n\nJuly 23, 1:00 p.m.: Updated with revised estimates for Sound of Freedom.\n\nJuly 24, 7 a.m.: Updated with Monday actuals for Barbie and Oppenheimer.\n\nJuly 24, 4:02 p.m.: Updated with Monday actuals for Mission: Impossible 7 and Sound of Freedom."

        "text": "New York CNN —\n\n“Barbie” has answered the billion-dollar question with a resounding “yes.” Barely three weeks into its run, writer-director Greta Gerwig’s blockbuster has raked in an astounding $1.03 billion at the global box office, according to official Warner Bros. estimates. This makes Gerwig the first solo female director with a billion-dollar movie.\n\nAs one half of the viral “Barbenheimer” phenomenon, it isn’t shocking “Barbie” has performed well. And, standing on her own two feet, the doll’s incredible success is not unexpected at all.\n\n“I’ve been in this game for 30 years and the Barbie and Barbenheimer phenomenon is as unprecedented as it was unpredictable,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.\n\nAccording to Dergarabedian, only about 50 films in history, unadjusted for inflation, have hit the billion-dollar mark.\n\nHe added the movie’s marketing campaign was the first hint “Barbie” would be a box office smash. “The marketing campaign for ‘Barbie’ set into motion a chain of events that led to the word ‘Barbenheimer’ being added to the popular lexicon by virtue of its shared release date with ‘Oppenheimer,’ and that’s when we all knew something very special and unique was going to create a much bigger than expected outcome for the film not only for the opening weekend, but for its global run in theaters.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Why does it matter that Barbie is on her tiptoes? 04:30 - Source: CNN\n\nIn an interview with Collider last month, Margot Robbie — who produced the movie in addition to playing the titular character — shared a premonition she had at a greenlight meeting with studios.\n\n“I think I told them they’d make a billion dollars which, maybe I was overselling, but we had a movie to make!” she said.\n\n“Barbie” was distributed by Warner Bros., which is owned by CNN’s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nIts global success was driven by box office sales in some of the world’s largest movie markets, including the United Kingdom, Mexico and Australia. The movie has been the No. 1 release in these markets every weekend since its release, according to tracking site Box Office Mojo.\n\n“Barbie” also performed well in China, the second-largest market in the world and one that has becoming increasingly insular over the past few years. According to experts, franchise films like “Transformers,” “Fast and Furious,” and Marvel’s superhero movies tend to perform well with Chinese audiences. While “Barbie” is similar to “Transformers” in that it’s based on an existing toy, it’s “not an IP that generations of Chinese have grown up with, so you lack the intergenerational appeal that a film like ‘Barbie’ has in the United States,” said Michael Berry, director of UCLA’s Center for Chinese Studies.\n\nBut Berry, who researches Chinese cinema and pop culture, says Barbie is still iconic around the world, giving the movie a solid springboard for international acclaim.\n\n“Children in hundreds of countries… have grown up with the dolls, her imagery… (but) the film exploits that name-recognition in a very savvy way by playing into both the Barbie lovers and Barbie haters,” he said. “The film is also able to deftly walk a tightrope that appeals to both naïve and wide-eyed eight-year-old dreamers, who approach the film on one level, and adult audiences, who are able to interpret the film on an entirely different level, full of irony, humor, sexual innuendos, and allegory.”\n\n“Barbie” has become everything from a relationship litmus test to a celebration of womanhood for people who may have come for the hot-pink outfits and stayed for the film’s existential questions.\n\n“Driving that discourse is the film’s embrace of what generations of women have both loved and hated about the brand and what it’s often represented in the past,” said BoxOffice Pro chief analyst Shawn Robbins, adding that the movie “has tapped into cultural conversations about gender roles and female empowerment that aren’t bound by international borders.”"

No movie in the studio’s 100-year history has sold so many tickets so fast, said Jeff Goldstein, Warner’s president of domestic distribution. As of Sunday, “Barbie” had been playing in theaters for 17 days. (“Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2” was previously the fastest to $1 billion, at 19 days.)\n\nMs. Gerwig could not be reached, according to a spokeswoman. Warner Bros. was giddy. “PINK FEVER,” Mr. Goldstein wrote in a text message. “Barbie” was No. 1 in the United States and Canada for the third weekend in a row, collecting $53 million, for a new domestic total of $459.4 million.\n\n“Barbie” once again disproved a stubborn Hollywood myth: that “girl” movies — films made by women, starring women and aimed at women — are limited in their appeal. An old movie industry maxim holds that women will go to a “guy” movie but not vice versa."

Discovery and Mattel will top $1 billion in global ticket sales, before the end of the weekend, according to estimates from the studio. Final numbers will be released Monday.\n\nOnly around 50 other films have reached this benchmark.\n\n\"In this march past the billion-dollar threshold, 'Barbie' joins what has become an increasingly exclusive club over the past couple of years,\" said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. \"That's especially true for auteur filmmaker Greta Gerwig becoming the first solo female director to helm a billion-dollar grosser.\"\n\nGerwig joins Anna Boden, co-director of Disney's \"Captain Marvel,\" as the only two women to helm a live-action billion-dollar film. \"Captain Marvel\" reached just shy of $1.13 billion during its theatrical run in 2019, according to data from Comscore.\n\nOn the animation side, Jennifer Lee has two billion-dollar features under her belt, having co-directed \"Frozen\" and \"Frozen II\" with Chris Buck for Disney.\n\nThis also marks the first billion-dollar film for the newly minted Warner Bros. Discovery, which merged in 2022, and only the second movie released in 2023 to do so. Universal's \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" has topped $1.3 billion since its April debut.\n\n\"This monumental box office achievement for 'Barbie' shows what is possible when all of the elements of filmmaking, marketing, distribution, fan engagement and movie theater presentation work in harmony,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst from Comscore. \"And a sprinkling of 'Barbenheimer' magic certainly didn't hurt either.\"\n\nThe success of \"Barbie\" comes at a time when blockbuster-budgeted films have struggled to connect with moviegoing audiences. Nostalgia bait flicks like Disney's \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\" as well as sequels for Paramount's Mission Impossible series and Universal's Fast and Furious franchise failed to lure in audiences. Each film tallied less than $200 million in domestic box office receipts.\n\n\"Barbie\" shows that moviegoers are still interested in leaving their couches for quality films and unique communal experiences. Movie theaters big and small announced record ticket sales in the month of July as pink-clad audiences packed theaters.\n\n\"The box office powerhouse isn't done yet as the coming weeks offer little in the way of direct competition, giving 'Barbie' plenty of runway to continue building on this success,\" Robbins said.\n\nDisclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC.\n\nCORRECTION: This article has been updated to show that, on the animation side, Jennifer Lee has two billion-dollar features under her belt, having co-directed \"Frozen\" and \"Frozen II\" with Chris Buck for Disney."

        "text": "“Barbenheimer” is probably the film event of the year. The simultaneous premieres of two Hollywood blockbusters by two cult directors: Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, a pink fantasy comedy and Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, a sombre and psychedelic drama.\n\nThe juxtaposition of atmosphere, characters and issues unleashed lively debates in the press and on social media, ranging from hilarious memes to existential questions. For the Greenpeace community, these two films echo past and present campaigns against very real existential threats: deforestation, plastic pollution and nuclear annihilation.\n\nBarbie: a long love affair with deforestation and plastic\n\nGerwig’s Barbie is a funny and resolutely feminist film. It’s funny and touching to see how everything goes wrong in this perfect universe when the main Barbie, played by actress Margot Robbie, starts to think about death. This existential crisis sees Barbie embark on a journey of discovery to the ‘real world’: Los Angeles.\n\nIn the REAL real world, Barbie is a plastic doll released by Mattel 60 years ago. The company said that 58 million dolls are sold every year, or about 100 dolls every minute, to people in 150 countries. While Gerwig’s Barbie may worry about her expiry date in reality she will most likely last forever, lost in landfills and discarded in dumps.\n\nBeyond her baggage (promoting an unrealistic body image among young girls, maintaining anti-feminist sexist stereotypes and propagating a particular standard of beauty, marginalising people of colour), Barbie has also had a long love affair with plastic — and ended a very toxic one with deforestation after a very intense intervention.\n\nAction at Mattel HQ in California, June 2011 – Greenpeace activists dressed as “Ken” dolls hang two huge banners at Mattel headquarters. The banner depicts an angry “Ken” with a clear message to his former girlfriend: “Barbie It’s Over. I Don’t Date Girls That Are Into Deforestation.” © Gus Ruelas / Greenpeace\n\nGreenpeace International investigators had found that the toymaker Mattel was using packaging from materials supplied by Asia Pulp and Paper (APP), which had been exposed for wrecking Indonesia’s rainforests. At the time, Mattel promised to stop using deforestation-linked materials in its packaging. A promising victory, a step against pulp and paper companies that continue to threaten some of the world’s largest remaining rainforests.\n\nOne from the archives: Did you know back in 2011 there was something else that caused Barbie to go viral? This satirical video! Greenpeace and thousands of other supporters were there for the ride.\n\nThen there’s Barbie’s not-so-fantastic “plastic” which, despite being served in miniature pieces, is still a massive issue today! According to a 2014 United Nations Environment Programme report, the toy industry uses more plastic in its actual products on a revenue basis than any other sector. Last year, American researchers quantified what each Barbie doll costs the climate. Every 182-gram Barbie causes about 660 grams of carbon emissions, including plastic production, manufacture and transport.\n\nThis is a useful reminder that plastic is just fossil fuel in disguise (99% of plastic is made from fossil fuels, like fracked gas and oil) and that it contributes to climate change throughout all its life cycle. That’s why Greenpeace is continuing to fight for an ambitious global plastics treaty that would cap and phase down plastic production, including a phase-out of virgin plastic production.\n\nLet’s end the age of plastic! Ask world leaders to support a strong global plastic treaty that addresses the whole life cycle of plastic. Take action\n\nOppenheimer: the fever dream that reminds us of the horror of nuclear weapons\n\nIn the late 1920s, J. Robert Oppenheimer was one of many promising physicists who had left America to study in Europe. He soon developed a passion for quantum mechanics and constantly dreamt of that other world: that of atoms, matter and dead stars collapsing in on themselves in the silence of space.\n\nOppenheimer did not yet know that he would help create the atomic bomb, contributing to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. He had not yet “become death, the destroyer of worlds”.\n\nJanuary 1998 – Nuclear Testing Action at Taj Mahal in India. The Greenpeace hot air balloon with the slogan ‘Nuclear Disarmament Now!’ flies above the famous Taj Mahal in a protest against nuclear testing in India. © Greenpeace / Steve Morgan\n\nNuclear arms are the most destructive, indiscriminate and monstrous weapons ever made. In January 2021, we celebrated a major milestone: the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) is now part of international law.\n\nThis new treaty will make it harder for world leaders to describe nuclear weapons as a legitimate and useful means to provide security. It creates a global norm against nuclear weapons that will hopefully lead us to a nuclear-free world in the future.\n\nIn the age of global heating the threat of a nuclear winter is far from over: in June 2023, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) released its annual assessment of the state of armaments, disarmament and international security, which shows that nuclear arsenals are being fortified around the world.\n\nThe global stockpile of nuclear weapons is expected to rise due to global tensions, according to leading arms watchdog SIPRI https://t.co/sEE1uZmV1k pic.twitter.com/vAPVWtVE2D — Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) June 13, 2022\n\n“Nuclear weapons, developed to win wars, are a threat of total annihilation (…) No sustainable society is possible with these weapons continually poised for indiscriminate slaughter.” These are the words of Kazumi Matsui, the mayor of Hiroshima since 2011.\n\nEliminating nuclear weapons is the only guarantee they will never be used. Nuclear power and nuclear weapons are two sides of the same coin. In order to end all nuclear threats, we must phase out both.\n\nA movie ending: We ALL live happily ever after\n\nSo, what are we to do if we want to live happily ever after? As we tackle the crises of climate, inequality and health, it’s clear there isn’t one approach, but a single driver: greed. Shaping a sustainable equitable future that puts people and the planet before corporate greed and elite profiteering is necessary, and possible.\n\nBuilding a better world is within our reach — and it takes all of us."

        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — A week later, the “Barbenheimer” boom has not abated.\n\nWhat You Need To Know Seven days after Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” conspired to set box office records, the two films held unusually strongly in theaters “Barbie” took in a massive $93 million in its second weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday “Oppenheimer\" again landed in second place with an estimated $46.2 million New release “Haunted Mansion” was easily overshadowed by the “Barbenheimer” blitz, debuting with $24 million domestically\n\nSeven days after Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” conspired to set box office records, the two films held unusually strongly in theaters. “Barbie” took in a massive $93 million in its second weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. “Oppenheimer” stayed in second with a robust $46.2 million. Sales for the two movies dipped 43% and 44%, respectably — well, shy of the usual week-two drops.\n\n“Barbenheimer” has proven to be not a one-weekend phenomenon but an ongoing box-office bonanza. The two movies combined have already surpassed $1 billion in worldwide ticket sales. Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore, calls it “a touchstone moment for movies, moviegoers and movie theaters.”\n\n“Having two movies from rival studios linked in this way and both boosting each other’s fortunes — both box-office wise and it terms of their profile — I don’t know if there’s a comp for this in the annals of box-office history,” said Dergarabedian. “There’s really no comparison for this.”\n\nFollowing its year-best $162 million opening, the pink-infused pop sensation of “Barbie” saw remarkably sustained business through the week and into the weekend. The film outpaced Nolan’s “The Dark Knight” to have the best first 11 days in theaters of any Warner Bros. release ever.\n\n“Barbie” has rapidly accumulated $351.4 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters, a rate that will soon make it the biggest box-office hit of the summer. Every day it’s played, “Barbie” has made at least $20 million.\n\nAnd the “Barbie” effect isn’t just in North America. The film made $122.2 million internationally over the weekend. Its global tally has reached $775 million. It’s the kind of business that astounds even veteran studio executives.\n\n“That’s a crazy number,” said Jeff Goldstein, distribution chief for Warner Bros. “There’s just a built-in audience that wants to be part of the zeitgeist of the moment. Wherever you go, people are wearing pink. Pink is taking over the world.”\n\nAmid the frenzy, “Barbie” is already attracting a lot of repeat moviegoers. Goldstein estimates that 12% of sales are people going back with friends or family to see it again.\n\nFor a movie industry that has be trying to regain its pre-pandemic footing — and that now finds itself largely shuttered due to actors and screenwriters strikes — the sensations of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” have showed what’s possible when everything lines up just right.\n\n“Post-pandemic, there’s no ceiling and there’s no floor,” said Goldstein. “The movies that miss really miss big time and the movies that work really work big time.”\n\nUniversal Pictures’ “Oppenheimer,” meanwhile, is performing more like a superhero movie than a three-hour film about scientists talking.\n\nNolan’s drama starring Cillian Murphy as atomic bomb physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer has accrued $174.1 million domestically thus far. With an additional $72.4 million in international cinemas, “Oppenheimer” has already surpassed $400 million globally.\n\nShowings in IMAX have typically been sold out. “Oppenheimer” has made $80 million worldwide on IMAX. The large-format exhibitor said Sunday that it will extend the film’s run through Aug. 13.\n\nThe week’s top new release, Walt Disney Co.’s “Haunted Mansion,” an adaptation of the Disney theme park attraction, was easily overshadowed by the “Barbenheimer” blitz. The film, which cost about $150 million, debuted with $24 million domestically and $9 million in overseas sales. “Haunted Mansion,” directed by Justin Simien (“Dear White People,” “Bad Hair”) and starring an ensemble of LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Haddish, Owen Wilson, Danny DeVito and Rosario Dawson, struggled to overcome mediocre reviews.\n\n“Talk to Me,” the A24 supernatural horror film fared better. It debuted with $10 million. The film, directed by Australian filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou and starring Sophie Wilde, was a midnight premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January and received terrific reviews from critics (95% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes). It was made for a modest $4.5 million.\n\nWhile theaters being flush with moviegoers has been a huge boon to the film industry, it’s been tougher sledding for Tom Cruise, the so-called savior of the movies last summer with “Top Gun: Maverick.” “Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part I,” which debuted the week before the arrival of “Barbenheimer,” grossed $10.7 million in its third weekend. The film starring Cruise and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, has grossed $139.2 million domestically and $309.3 million oveseas.\n\nInstead, the sleeper hit “Sound of Freedom” has been the best performing non-“Barbenheimer” release in theaters. The Angel Studios’ release, which is counting crowdfunding pay-it-forward sales in its box office totals, made $12.4 million in its fourth weekend, bringing its haul thus far to nearly $150 million.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.\n\n1. “Barbie,” $93 million.\n\n2. “Opppenheimer,” $46.2 million.\n\n3. “Haunted Mansion,” $24.2 million.\n\n4. “Sound of Freedom,” $12.4 million.\n\n5. “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One,” $10.7 million.\n\n6. “Talk to Me,” $10 million.\n\n7. “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” $4 million.\n\n8. “Elemental,” $3.4 million.\n\n9. “Insidious: The Red Door,” $3.2 million.\n\n10. “Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani,” $1.6 million."

        "text": "New York CNN —\n\nDuring its first few days in theaters, “Barbie” raked in $337 million globally in the box office, the largest opening weekend of 2023 so far. But even before the numbers came in, “Barbie” was a merchandising hit.\n\nThe film had been generating hype for months, thanks to a star-studded cast, beloved director, dazzling aesthetic – and a seemingly endless array of Barbie-themed merchandise.\n\nIn June, brand strategist Moshe Isaacian started keeping track of the official partnerships on Twitter. A scroll through his thread shows, among other things: A gaming console, pair of shoes, hotel, house, insurance commercial, a candle, rugs, nail polish, roller blades, a toy car, a lunchbox, dog apparel, a toothbrush and several other items emblazoned with the Barbie logo, awash in hot pink.\n\nIsaacian has posted about roughly 50 partnerships. That’s, almost literally, the half of it: Mattel, maker of the iconic toy, has made over 100 brand deals for the movie, which is distributed by Warner Bros. (CNN and Warner Bros. are both owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n\nA man poses in a large Barbie doll box at Bloomingdale's in New York, ahead of the movie's release. Richard Drew/AP\n\nFor marketers, “Barbie” has turned into a massive opportunity: A rosy, fizzy way to get new customers – of all ages – and stay culturally relevant. That’s always a good opportunity, but especially so in the current environment, where even seemingly benign marketing campaigns can be controversial.\n\nAnd it’s not often that so much attention is focused on a single event, like a movie premier.\n\n“We live in such a fragmented world, that it is really hard for events to break through the clutter,” said Tim Calkins, associate chair of the marketing department at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. “These shared moments, when they really catch on, have enormous power.”\n\nThe Barbie effect\n\nFor some bars and restaurants, Barbie mania has led to a rush of patrons.\n\nIn the spring, when Barbie memes started leaving their glittery trail across the internet, the team at Wunder Garten, a beer garden and event space in Washington, DC, started to take notice.\n\nAround that time, it started planning Barbie parties: Celebrations with themed cocktails, pink food and plenty of opportunities to show off Barbiecore outfits in the Instagram-friendly venue, including life-size hot pink Barbie and Ken boxes.\n\n“We were expecting a very big turnout, and we got a very, very big turnout,” said Leana Chavez, assistant manager at Wunder Garten.\n\nA Barbie-inspired cabana at Wunder Garten. From wundergartendc/Instagram\n\nMeanwhile, retailers have used partnerships to boost product sales.\n\nCandle maker Homesick has been selling a Barbie Dreamhouse candle with notes of sweet peony, rose bush and pink jasmine, among other scents. The candle drove a 39% increase in sales in June, year-over-year, according to Lauren McCord, General Manager of Homesick. And most of that came from new customers: Over 70% of Dreamhouse purchases were made by new clients.\n\nThe Barbie brand is particularly powerful because it appeals to multiple generations, noted Christie Nordhielm, an associate teaching professor of marketing at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business.\n\nBy marketing Barbie products to adults, large retailers may be able to get them to buy similar products for kids.\n\n“Parents, or possibly other family members, will gatekeep on whether this product comes in,” she said. With Barbie products that appeal to grown-ups, marketers are “getting that interactivity between adults and children, that bonding,” which can also be used as a selling point.\n\nGap may benefit from this aspect of the marketing. The clothing retailer offers a Barbie line that includes Gap and Barbie branded t-shirts, jackets and more, for both kids and adults. A Gap spokesperson noted that the collection “has been killing it across all categories.” The relationship between Gap and Mattel runs deep: On Wednesday, Gap announced that its new CEO will be Richard Dickson, who currently serves as Mattel’s president and chief operating officer.\n\nBarbie themed merchandise at a Gap store in New York. Richard B. Levine/Levine Roberts/ZUMA Press\n\nIn retrospect, and with huge box office numbers under its belt, it seems clear why so many companies would want to work with “Barbie.” But partner products were conceived and launched well before the movie premiered, when there was a possibility that it wouldn’t be so well received. During that period of uncertainty, they may have been soothed by the sheer volume of partnerships.\n\nIn other words, if “Barbie” was a flop, they’d all go down together.\n\nStrength in numbers\n\nThere are plenty of ways for “Barbie” to have gone wrong.\n\nThe doll itself has a spotty history, and with its inhuman proportions has been accused of upholding unrealistic beauty standards. Plus, movies in general are not a safe financial bet: Aside from breakthroughs like “Barbie” and Oppenheimer, box office sales have been disappointing, making a sluggish return after pandemic-era theater closures.\n\nSome Barbie decoration at a Zara store in Gran Via street in Madrid on July 22. David Canales/SOPA Images/Shutterstock\n\nAnd there was no guarantee that people would like the movie. Some might still see Barbie as anti-feminist, or anti-male, and the movie as little more than a major corporate effort to boost the doll’s sales. Others may have been turned off by the relentless marketing, especially for a movie with a message that (spoiler alert) people don’t need to buy products to feel good about themselves. And then there’s the fact that “Barbie” was directed by a woman and marketed to women, which can inspire online trolling.\n\nFor brand partners, “there was some risk that this movie might be a total bomb,” said David Reibstein, professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton business school. But that risk was “dampened by the fact that others are doing it. And so if we look bad, well, we’re not alone.”\n\nA lucky few could stay at Barbie's iconic Malibu Dreamhouse, in Malibu, California, via Airbnb. Mike Blake/Reuters\n\nBut while there have been calls to boycott the film, they don’t seem to have gotten much traction. Now, with everything coming up Barbie, marketers may lose out by staying away.\n\n“I think there is a risk of not doing it,” Reibstein said. “If you happen to be a retailer and you see the other retailers doing it, you sort of feel like you need to be on the bandwagon… and not miss whatever Barbie wave there might be.” At this stage, that may mean using the success of “Barbie” to market pre-existing hot pink products.\n\nBut with everyone going in, it becomes even harder to stand out.\n\nThis Barbie is just like all the others\n\nIf your promotion is too similar to another, “it’s going to limit the lift that you get, because it’s just more of the same,” said Northwestern’s Calkins. Once you see one Barbie-pink nail polish, for example, you probably won’t be wowed by another.\n\nIsaacian, who started the Twitter thread, thinks Mattel has been strategic in choosing its partners, even though there are so many.\n\nCold Stone Creamery's Barbie-themed ice cream in a Barbie-themed cup. From Cold Stone Creamery/Facebook\n\n“They’ve really done a good job of making almost all parts of the movie feel tangible,” he said.\n\nFor Reibstein, the collaboration that stood out was the Airbnb Malibu Dreamhouse. Staying at the Dreamhouse is free, but Airbnb only made it available for two nights in July.\n\nPrior to those dates, model and TV personality Chrissy Teigen shared photos of herself and her family in the Instagram-friendly house, including one boomerang video of her in a hot pink outfit and Ken-inspired roller blades.\n\nNordhielm pointed to Cold Stone Creamery’s Barbie pink cotton candy ice cream as a standout. “It”s a happy product, it’s a family product,” she said."

        "text": "BEIRUT, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Lebanon's culture minister moved to ban the film \"Barbie\" from cinemas on Wednesday, saying it \"promotes homosexuality\" and contradicts religious values.\n\nMinister Mohammad Mortada is backed by powerful Shi'ite armed group Hezbollah, whose head Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has ramped up his rhetoric against the LGBT community, referring in a recent speech to Islamic texts that call for punishing offenders with death.\n\nMortada's decision said the film was found to \"promote homosexuality and sexual transformation\" and \"contradicts values of faith and morality\" by diminishing the importance of the family unit.\n\nBased on Mortada's move, Interior Minister Bassam Mawlawi in turn asked General Security's censorship committee, which falls under the interior ministry and is traditionally responsible for censorship decisions, to review the film and give its recommendation.\n\nKuwait followed in Lebanon's footsteps later in the day, saying it had banned \"Barbie\" and supernatural horror film \"Talk to Me\" to protect \"public ethics and social traditions\", the state news agency said.\n\nLebanon was the first Arab country to hold a gay pride week in 2017 and has generally been seen as a safe haven for the LGBT community in the broadly conservative Middle East.\n\nPeople walk past a promotional poster of film \"Barbie\" in Tokyo, Japan, August 3, 2023. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nBut the issue has come into sharper focus recently, sparking tensions. Mawlawi last year took a decision to ban events \"promoting sexual perversion\" in Lebanon, understood to refer to LGBT-friendly gatherings.\n\nIn a speech last month, Nasrallah called on Lebanese authorities to take action against materials he deemed to be promoting homosexuality, including by \"banning\" them.\n\nHe said homosexuality posed an \"imminent danger\" to Lebanon and should be \"confronted\". In the case of a homosexual act, Nasrallah said in late July, \"from the first time, even if he is unmarried, he is killed\".\n\nOn Tuesday, Lebanon's cabinet urged citizens to \"cling\" to family values following a meeting with the country's top Christian cleric Patriarch Bechara Boutros al-Rai, although it did not mention the LGBT community specifically.\n\nAyman Mhanna, executive director at the non-profit civic Samir Kassir Foundation, told Reuters that Mortada's move came amid \"a wave of bigotry\".\n\n\"This is part of a broader campaign that is bringing together Hezbollah, the Christian far right, and other top religious leaders in a focused campaign against LGBT people,\" Mhanna said.\n\nStarring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Barbie and Ken, the movie sends Mattel Inc's (MAT.O) doll on an adventure into the real world. The film has topped $1 billion in box office ticket sales worldwide since its July 21 debut.\n\nReporting by Laila Bassam and Maya Gebeily; Editing by Toby Chopra, Nick Macfie & Shri Navaratnam\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

        "text": "“Barbie is really important for us,” beamed Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav on the conglom’s Q2 earnings call about what will be the first pic to hit $1 billion under his reign.\n\nIn celebrating the pic’s success, he indicated that the movie would hit streaming service Max in the fall.\n\nHowever, on a long theatrical window.\n\n“We really believe in the motion picture window — let it play out … go into PVOD, take it through the windows that have worked forever [in the business],” he said. “When it goes on Max, it will have a good impact in the fall.”\n\nSeparately, Deadline has noticed that Barbie will hit airlines this September.\n\nRELATED: 2023 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming\n\nZaslav since taking charge of Warner Bros Discovery has championed the theatrical window passionately, unlike the former Warner Bros Media administration that upset the town with their theatrical-day-and-date experiment on HBO Max during Covid.\n\nZaslav also mentioned how he rallied all the departments at the conglom to work together to build “The Summer of Barbie“. This included a Barbie dreamhouse special on HGTV which premiered to 4M viewers and was broadcasted in 106 countries as well as Barbie Food Network special and a sneak peek during NBA Finals on Turner sports. It’s a cross vertical promo playbook that Zaslav executed for HBO’s House of the Dragon and The Last of Us, as well as the videogame Hogwarts Legacy.\n\nRELATED: July Domestic Box Office On Fire With $1.37 Billion, Second Best Ever\n\n“All of our platforms can have an impact globally,” he said today.\n\n“It starts with great content,” he continued giving a shoutout to Margot Robbie and Barbie director Greta Gerwig’s globe-trotting promotion for the tentpole.\n\nBarbie will cross the $400M mark at the domestic box office today, in its 14th day, beating Top Gun: Maverick and Super Mario Bros Movie to that benchmark, both crossing in 18 days. The Mattel doll should cross the $1 billion mark on either Sunday or Monday. Total global outlook per sources is $1.3 billion for Barbie.\n\nRELATED: Warner Bros. U.S. Responds To Barbenheimer Criticism Out Of Japan\n\nWBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels said today on the call that the fruits of Barbie will be realized in Q3 for the company.\n\nMeanwhile, DC’s The Flash, which had a 31-day theatrical window to PVOD, was considered a drag on WBD’s lackluster Q2 today.\n\nRELATED: International Cinema Chain Vue Records “Best Ever Week” Thanks To ‘Barbie’ & ‘Oppenheimer’\n\nBarbie was greenlit and shepherded by the former Warners motion picture administration led by Toby Emmerich and Courtenay Valenti."

        "text": "“Think pink! think pink! when you shop for summer clothes. Think pink! think pink! if you want that quelque chose.”\n\nThat advice, sung as an epiphany in the 1957 musical film “Funny Face,” has definitely been heeded — just take a look around at fashion and media. The fascination around pink — each shade and hue with its own connotation — has shaped those cultural engines for generations, revving into full force as we reach peak “Barbie” season.\n\nThe color has been a crucial detail for films and television — from that scene in “Funny Face,” to Elle Woods sporting her iconic head-to-toe vibrant pink courtroom outfit in 2001’s “Legally Blonde,” to “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” where the shades of pink in costuming play a symbolic role in the final season. And, now, with the Greta Gerwig-helmed film’s release, the vividly hot “Barbie Pink” is inescapable.\n\nThroughout history, designers, artists, and brands have played with the emotions the color evokes, shaping meanings that are ever-evolving. From gender to class, those associations have constantly been challenged, flipped and subverted — while the definition of pink is always in flux, there’s one constant: its cultural staying power.The meanings behind the many shades of pink\n\nPink first became fashionable in the 18th century in the French court, because of a new source of dye that imparted a more vivid, long-lasting color in fabrics, explained Valerie Steele, director of The Museum at FIT and one of the authors of “Pink: The History of a Punk, Pretty, Powerful Color.”\n\nSince then, the cachet of pink has ebbed and flowed; as pink dyes became more accessible to the working class, the color lost its association with wealth and prestige.\n\nWhen first popularized, it was worn by men and women alike, but in the 1920s, U.S. department stores claimed blue for boys and pink for girls.\n\n“It was really totally arbitrary,” Steele said of the correlation.\n\nFast forward a few generations to 2016, when Pantone chose “Rose Quartz” as a color of the year: The muted dusty pink is calming but also connotes strength, said Laurie Pressman, vice president of the Pantone Color Institute. She told The Associated Press one of the reasons for the pick was the rise of the “gender blur.” (The color was quickly embraced by fashion and interior designers, earning the moniker of “millennial pink.”)\n\nThat symbiotic influence — pink providing texture to and receiving a boost from a cultural force — was evident the next year at the Women’s March on Washington, where demonstrators donned loudly pink “pussy hats.”\n\n“Pink has become, in many ways, the most controversial color in fashion, and fashion is always interested in controversy,” Steele said.\n\nFor British artist Stuart Semple, pink is the color of rebellion and taking space. Semple created the “pinkest pink” paint in 2016 as a reaction to artist Anish Kapoor purchasing and reserving the artistic rights to the Vantablack pigment, said to be the world’s blackest black.\n\nSemple has made his paint — intended to be the fluorescent apotheosis of the color — accessible to the world at an affordable price.\n\n“I thought it was wrong for me to hold this amazing color that I’d made. So I wanted to make it available to everyone,” Semple told the AP. “Apart from him (Kapoor), for obvious reasons.”\n\nSemple chose pink because it was the “antithesis” of black and it’s a color that’s political, vibrant and “the perfect thing to sort of challenge conventions.”\n\nTanisha Ford, a history professor at The Graduate Center at the City University of New York, noted how male artists — specifically male artists of color like Bad Bunny; Tyler, The Creator, and Jaden Smith — have generated more complex conversations about masculinity by wearing pink clothing.\n\nThe color is subversive but also used in a very “tongue-and-cheek kind of way,” Ford said.\n\n“People of color have been denied leisure and denied rest,” Ford said. “So … if you’re wearing these preppy clothes or you’re wearing your yacht chic clothes, you are staking a claim into leisure.”\n\nWhen it comes down to it, there’s a simple reason why people still wear pink: It looks good.\n\n“At its core, it’s a very flattering color,” Barry Manuel, a New York University fashion professor says.\n\nThe season of ‘Barbie Pink’\n\nPink has long been associated with the Barbie brand — she even has her own Pantone color. But even though Barbie was first released in 1959, Mattel didn’t star featuring predominantly pink packaging until the 1970s, said Kim Culmone, Mattel’s senior vice president and global head of Barbie and fashion dolls design.\n\nWhen discussing shades of pink associated with the brand, Culmone noted that there’s something inspiring and joyful about “Barbie Pink.”\n\n“Most importantly it’s, for us, it’s really a symbolism of empowerment. Barbie is the original girl empowerment brand,” Culmone said.\n\nIt was no surprise that the film’s first full-length trailer dripped pink, showing Barbie Land as a fun, cotton candy wonderland that looks a little artificial. After the trailer was released, news reports claimed the production team bought so many cans of pink paint that it depleted the world’s supply.\n\nGerwig told the AP that she wasn’t so sure about that — but she did confirm the crew did buy every can of pink paint from one particular company. The director explained it was important to use pink paint to capture older film techniques and to make the audience feel like Barbie Land was tactile.\n\n“It’s toys, and what are toys but things that you touch? And so getting all that pink paint, to paint everything was important,” Gerwig said.\n\nCapitalizing on color\n\nSemple, however, has taken issue with the monopoly and the “press done around running out the paint supply.”\n\n“Whether it’s true or not, it’s still not very nice,” he told the AP.\n\nSemple explains he’s standing up to what he calls “Big Color,” where corporations dominate the usage. He cited “Tiffany Blue,” the trademark color of the jewelry company.\n\nIn response to “Barbie,” Semple went back to his previous game plan and created “the Barbiest pink.” Called “Pinkie,” anyone can buy the paint color — as long as they attest to not being employed by Mattel.\n\n“Colors should belong to everybody. And corporations should do what they do best, which is corporate stuff, and perhaps leave colors alone,” Semple said.\n\nWhen asked for comment on Semple’s “Pinkie” paint, a Mattel spokesperson simply responded in an email, “While not a registered trademark, Barbie Pink is recognized as a famous trademark of the brand.”\n\nWe’re drawn to colors because they instantly convey various emotions, explained David Loranger, a professor of fashion merchandising and marketing at Sacred Heart University.\n\n“I feel like having a direct line to the senses from a marketing standpoint is so important because it’s a nonverbal, it’s a semiotic vehicle,” Loranger said. “The best marketing is very deeply rooted in emotion.”\n\nBut from where do those innate emotional connections stem? It could come from something in nature, a belief system or something we’ve been told.\n\n“Every color has meaning that we almost inherently sense from that color, whether we’ve learned about it by association or just conditioning, which helps us to intuitively understand the message and the meaning that’s delivered,” Pressman said.\n\nWhen it comes to consumer marketing, the wide variance in pink’s meanings means everyone can get in on the action. From high fashion — Valentino collaborated with Pantone and created a collection out of the resulting custom shade, shown on a pink runway last March — to everyday items, pink abounds.\n\nBrands now help shape our perception of color, and it pays to have a signature shade.\n\n“Color can be an effective marketing tool. But more than I’d say it’s a bigger idea about claiming something, finding something new to talk about telling the consumer a story,” Miguel said.\n\nEncased in pink, “Barbie” captures an artificial dreamland that instills nostalgia and joy, satisfying the audience’s urge to escape.\n\n“People are happy to find something that captures the imagination and transports them to somewhere simple, happy and fun,” Miguel said, “and pink is that.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalist Krysta Fauria contributed to this story."

        "text": "CNN —\n\nRyan Gosling may or may not be your ideal Ken in the new “Barbie” movie, but one of the film’s casting directors has shared who else might have gotten the role.\n\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair, Allison Jones — who cast the hit film along with Lucy Bevan — talked about who else might have joined Barbie in her dream house.\n\nLike the line of dolls the movie is based on, there are multiple Barbies and Kens portrayed by a diverse cast of actors.\n\nBut not everyone who wanted in was able to participate.\n\nAccording to Jones, Covid restrictions at the time meant having to spend three months in London where a great deal of the movie was filmed. And that meant Bowen Yang, Dan Levy, and Ben Platt were out of the running to play Ken.\n\n“They were, I’m not kidding, really bummed they couldn’t do it,” she said.\n\nBen Platt, Bowen Yang and Dan Levy.

On the key Barbie and Ken roles, she got a very good idea of what an actor was like from talking to them.”\n\nMargot Robbie snagged the main role of Barbie, though there are multiple other Barbies in the film played by a diverse group of actresses including Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae and Dua Lipa."

        "text": "If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement .\n\nGreta Gerwig’s Barbie is finally upon us, and audiences love it. The comedy starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as the eponymous doll and her maybe-boyfriend Ken has made big money at the box office, with audiences and critics both effusively praising the film’s extravagant production design and pitch-perfect soundtrack alongside Robbie’s and Gosling’s sensational performances.\n\nGreatness never occurs in a vacuum, and that goes especially for Gerwig’s film. Speaking to Letterboxd prior to the film’s premiere, the director cited over 30 movies that inspired her while working on the film, from musicals and fast-talking comedies starring Gene Kelly and Cary Grant to films directed by such cinematic icons as Federico Fellini, Stanley Kubrick, Jacques Demy, and Pedro Almodóvar.\n\nIf you’re aching for more Barbie-like entertainment, we’ve pulled together a list of where you can stream or rent nearly all of the films Gerwig has cited as inspiration. Classics like A Matter of Life and Death, All That Jazz, and Oklahoma! are sadly unavailable online, but trust us — there’s plenty here to keep you occupied.\n\nGold Diggers of 1935\n\nYear: 1935\n\nRun time: 1h 35m\n\nDirector: Busby Berkeley\n\nCast: Dick Powell, Adolphe Menjou, Gloria Stuart\n\nGerwig mentioned Gold Diggers of 1935 in the same breath as Fred Zinnemann’s 1955 adaptation of the musical Oklahoma! as a film that most inspired her approach to filming dance sequences in Barbie. Gold Diggers of 1935 centers on the romantic antics of a group of guests at a luxurious resort hotel, among them an eccentric millionaire, a wealthy heiress, and a stage director. “[The film] has this one really surreal dance number with a bunch of steps, Gerwig told Letterboxd. “There’s, like, a million tap dancers that go through each other. It’s kind of unreal.”\n\nGold Diggers of 1935 is available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nYear: 1968\n\nRun time: 2h 29m\n\nDirector: Stanley Kubrick\n\nCast: Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, Douglas Rain\n\nStanley Kubrick’s sci-fi opus has exerted a nigh monolithic (pun intended) influence over the medium of film and cinematic storytelling since it first landed in theaters in 1968. Among the film’s most iconic moments are that of its first scene, wherein a tribe of hominins first encounter the alien artifact that seemingly grants them the power of intelligence. The influence on Barbie is obvious to anyone who has seen the first trailer for the film, wherein a group of young girls standing in a valley similar to the one seen in 2001: A Space Odyssey first encounters the doll that would change the history of children’s toys forever.\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey is available to stream on Max, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nAn American in Paris\n\nYear: 1951\n\nRun time: 1h 54m\n\nDirector: Vincente Minnelli\n\nCast: Gene Kelly, Leslie Caron, Oscar Levant\n\nGerwig is a big fan of Gene Kelly. As she told Letterboxd, “When I was growing up, Gene Kelly was my crush, which was weird.” Not weird at all, Greta; after all, he’s a canonical Hollywood dreamboat!\n\nGerwig singled out the opening scene, in which Jerry wakes up in his tiny apartment and gets ready for the day, as a inspiration. “There was something so satisfying about watching him go through his morning routine — that was one of the morning routines I loved. Even though Barbie has much more of an expanse, I was like, ‘This is a great opening,’” Gerwig told Letterboxd. “Then they have Leslie Caron in these very graphic, beautiful shots against an entirely purple room or an entirely green room; she’s going through her day. It was these flourishes that were almost surreal in that film.”\n\nAn American in Paris is available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nAnd the Ship Sails On\n\nYear: 1983\n\nRun time: 2h 8m\n\nDirector: Federico Fellini\n\nCast: Freddie Jones, Barbara Jefford, Victor Poletti\n\nFederico Fellini is not quite the first name you’d think of as a possible inspiration for Barbie. The Italian filmmaker (and avid comic book fan) is one of the most influential directors of the 20th century, known for such eccentric and captivating masterpieces as La Strada, La Dolce Vita, and his 1963 magnum opus 8½. Gerwig cites Fellini’s 1983 comedy-drama And the Ship Sails On as an inspiration for her approach to crafting the more surreal, practical effects of Barbie — in particular the fake sea effect as seen in Fellini’s film.\n\nAnd the Ship Sails On is available to stream on Criterion Channel.\n\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind\n\nYear: 1977\n\nRun time: 2h 18m\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\n\nCast: Richard Dreyfuss, Teri Garr, Melinda Dillon\n\nGerwig cites Steven Spielberg’s sci-fi drama as one of her favorite movies and a key inspiration for Barbie. Speaking to Letterboxd, she explained that the film is “about this maniacal belief in something that seemed sort of crazy, but was actually true.”\n\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind is available to stream on Tubi and Pluto TV, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nGrease\n\nYear: 1978\n\nRun time: 1h 50m\n\nDirector: Randal Kleiser\n\nCast: John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, Stockard Channing\n\nBarbie owes a visible debt to the anachronistic flair of Grease, Randal Kleiser’s classic romantic musical starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John. “Grease is great,” Gerwig told Letterboxd. “It’s a musical about the 1950s, but made in the 1970s and everybody’s 30. Love it.”\n\nGrease is available to stream on Max, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nHeaven Can Wait\n\nYear: 1978\n\nRun time: 1h 41m\n\nDirector: Warren Beatty, Buck Henry\n\nCast: Warren Beatty, James Mason, Julie Christie\n\nIn between the fantastical music numbers and wacky set-pieces, Gerwig’s Barbie is punctuated by genuine moments of existential questioning and despair. Heaven Can Wait, the 1978 drama directed by and starring Warren Beatty, was one of the films Gerwig looked to for inspiration in that regard. “One thing I love about Heaven Can Wait is it’s extremely high concept, but it’s always human,” Gerwig told Letterboxd. “There’s nothing about it that makes you feel distanced from it. It totally works, even though in some ways it seems sort of wacky, but when you’re watching, it’s so beautiful.”\n\nHeaven Can Wait is available to stream on Pluto TV, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nHis Girl Friday\n\nYear: 1940\n\nRun time: 1h 32m\n\nDirector: Howard Hawks\n\nCast: Cary Grant, Rosalind Russell, Ralph Bellamy\n\nThe classic 1940 screwball comedy stars Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell as a formerly married newspaper editor and reporter who fall in love again while investigating the execution of a bookkeeper convicted of murder. His Girl Friday is one of the most iconic examples of the transatlantic accent, a distinctive fast-talking affect originated to imitate the hustle and bustle of upper-crust metropolitan elites. “His Girl Friday is one of the best fast-talking movies of all time,” Gerwig told Letterboxd.\n\nHis Girl Friday is available to stream on Prime Video, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nModel Shop\n\nYear: 1969\n\nRun time: 1h 37m\n\nDirector: Jacques Demy\n\nCast: Anouk Aimée, Gary Lockwood, Alexandra Hay\n\nGerwig lists not one, not two, but three Jacques Demy films as principal influences on Barbie. Demy’s flair for carefully constructed worlds with an emphasis on bright colors and complementary costume choices is apparent in Gerwig’s own approach to the pink-saturated wonderworld of Barbie and her friends.\n\nModel Shop is available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nModern Times\n\nYear: 1936\n\nRun time: 1h 27m\n\nDirector: Charlie Chaplin\n\nCast: Charlie Chaplin, Paulette Goddard, Henry Bergman\n\nCharlie Chaplin is the master of cinematic physical humor, a trait evident in nearly of all his films, though especially apparent in this 1936 satirical romance comedy. Barbie’s various stunts and chase sequences owe a debt to the inspiration of Chaplin’s character The Tramp, as Gerwig tells Letterboxd in her interview.\n\nModern Times is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel.\n\nMon Oncle\n\nYear: 1958\n\nRun time: 2h 35m\n\nDirector: Jacques Tati\n\nCast: Jacques Tati, Jean-Pierre Zola, Adrienne Servantie\n\nJacques Tati is a master of environmental comedy, known for his elaborately constructed set-pieces that foreground the delightfully clashing personalities of his characters while mischievously critiquing the absurdity of modern society. “Jacques Tati is the king of the slow joke,” Gerwig told Letterboxd. “The way those movies unfold are just so perfect. I always thought of Mattel as existing slightly in Jacques Tati’s world.”\n\nMon Oncle is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel.\n\nPee-wee’s Big Adventure\n\nYear: 1985\n\nRun time: 1h 30m\n\nDirector: Tim Burton\n\nCast: Paul Reubens, E.G. Daily, Mark Holton\n\nTim Burton’s feature-length adaptation of Paul Reubens’ iconic children’s TV character heavily inspired the fantastical set-pieces and comedic rhythm of Gerwig’s own Barbie. “There’s that section where he gets on a train and is a tramp on a train and sings songs, then he gets bored of it and falls off the train and it takes 60 seconds,” Gerwig told Letterboxd. “It’s hilarious, but it’s just a really short thing.”\n\nPee-Wee’s Big Adventure is available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nPlaytime\n\nYear: 1967\n\nRun time: 1h 55m\n\nDirector: Jacques Tati\n\nCast: Jacques Tati, Barbara Dennek, Rita Maiden\n\nAs mentioned previously, Tati’s work was a major inspiration for Gerwig’s Barbie. Playtime is often cited as Tati’s magnum opus, following the director’s bumbling protagonist Monsieur Hulot (played by Tati himself) as he wanders throughout a modern Parisian cityscape cramped with a dioramic assortment of hilarious and strange set-pieces.\n\nPlaytime is available to stream on Criterion Channel, or available to rent on Amazon and Apple.\n\nRear Window\n\nYear: 1954\n\nRun time: 1h 52m\n\nDirector: Alfred Hitchcock\n\nCast: James Stewart, Grace Kelly, Wendell Corey\n\nAlfred Hitchcock’s mystery-thriller about a photographer in a wheelchair who may or may not have witnessed the murder of one of his neighbors in his apartment block is not only one of the director’s most iconic and oft-imitated films, but a surprising influence on Barbie. In her interview with Letterboxd, Gerwig cited the practical construction of the film’s sets and backgrounds as an inspiration while working on her own film.\n\nRear Window is available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nSaturday Night Fever\n\nYear: 1977\n\nRun time: 1h 59m\n\nDirector: John Badham\n\nCast: John Travolta, Karen Lynn Gorney, Barry Miller\n\nBarbie is a lot of things: not quite a musical and not quite a drama, but a mish-mash of several different genres with a heavy emphasis on music. Gerwig cites Saturday Night Fever as an influence on her vision for Barbie as a movie supported by an amazing soundtrack. “Saturday Night Fever obviously has this incredible soundtrack by the Bee Gees. [...] I thought Barbie seemed so disco to me in her heart, because Barbie’s sort of — and I will say this as a lover of Barbie and disco — a little bit dorky in the best way,” Gerwig told Letterboxd. “Saturday Night Fever was a movie that was driven by music, but not a musical. I guess we’re half of a musical.”\n\nSaturday Night Fever is available to stream on Prime Video and Paramount Plus, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nSingin’ in the Rain\n\nYear: 1952\n\nRun time: 1h 43m\n\nDirector: Stanley Donen, Gene Kelly\n\nCast: Gene Kelly, Donald O’Connor, Debbie Reynolds\n\nGerwig cites Singin’ in the Rain as not just one of her favorite movies, but her very favorite. It’s no surprise, then, that the film would have an abundant influence on her work on Barbie. “There are so many great things in Singin’ in the Rain, but the dream ballet inside of the dream ballet is one of the most incredible, beautiful, completely unhinged things.”\n\nSingin’ in the Rain is available to stream on Max, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nSplash\n\nYear: 1984\n\nRun time: 1h 51m\n\nDirector: Ron Howard\n\nCast: Tom Hanks, Daryl Hannah, Eugene Levy\n\n“Splash is another movie that is utterly charming and works emotionally, even though it’s so high concept and it’s down to Daryl Hannah and Tom Hanks, who are so great,” Gerwig told Letterboxd. “I’m sure the tagline was, like, ‘Fish Out of Water.’ It felt like a crossing-worlds movie… It’s one I’ve loved since I was a kid, too.”\n\nSplash is available to stream on Disney Plus and MGM Plus, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nThe Earrings of Madame de…\n\nYear: 1953\n\nRun time: 1h 45m\n\nDirector: Max Ophüls\n\nCast: Charles Boyer, Danielle Darrieux, Vittorio De Sica\n\nGerwig cites Max Ophüls’ 1953 romantic drama film as an inspiration on Barbie for its beautiful camerawork. “I mean, I can’t believe some of those shots. They’re just extraordinary; it’s always a reminder of what we’re all going for.”\n\nThe Earrings of Madame de… is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel, or available to rent on Amazon and Apple.\n\nThe Godfather\n\nYear: 1972\n\nRun time: 2h 55m\n\nDirector: Francis Ford Coppola\n\nCast: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola’s crime drama masterpiece is one of the most celebrated films of the 20th century, so it’s only natural that Gerwig would find a way to fit a nod to The Godfather in her work on Barbie. If you know, you know.\n\nThe Godfather is available to stream on Paramount Plus, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nThe Ladies Man\n\nYear: 1961\n\nRun time: 1h 35m\n\nDirector: Jerry Lewis\n\nCast: Jerry Lewis, Helen Traubel, Pat Stanley\n\nJerry Lewis’ 1961 comedy about a man who takes up a job at a women-only boarding house after breaking up with his girlfriend is a key influence on Gerwig’s Barbie, particularly in its diorama approach to set design and iconic opening moments. “They built this house that was cut out, and then they moved around the rooms with a camera in this one continuous shot with all these girls getting ready,” Gerwig told Letterboxd. “It’s incredible. That’s where I got the idea for the mirror that has nothing in it that you look through, and it’s just her.”\n\nThe Ladies Man is available to stream on Showtime, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nThe Philadelphia Story\n\nYear: 1940\n\nRun time: 1h 52m\n\nDirector: George Cukor\n\nCast: Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart\n\nGerwig cited the 1940 comedy The Philadelphia Story as an influence on Barbie, not just for her love of Cary Grant, but as a inspiration for Margot Robbie’s portrayal of Barbie. “One of the reasons I loved it — and I said to Margot to watch it for Barbie because Katharine Hepburn describes herself as being a Grecian statue or something — is she’s unflappable and then she starts falling apart, and that’s actually where she finds herself,” Gerwig told Letterboxd. “It was actually already one of Margot’s favorite movies; she already had that in her back pocket, as it were.”\n\nThe Philadelphia Story is available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nThe Red Shoes\n\nYear: 1948\n\nRun time: 2h 15m\n\nDirector: Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger\n\nCast: Anton Walbrook, Marius Goring, Moira Shearer\n\nThe 1948 British drama about a ballerina who is forced to choose between her love for her career and her love for a composer is a dominant inspiration for Gerwig’s Barbie. “The Red Shoes [is] all over the movie. There’s a shot of her walking up to that house, which I wanted it to feel like that when Barbie walks up to [Weird Barbie’s] house. Ryan Gosling wears a pair of glasses that are the cat-eye glasses that the director wears in it, because I was like, ‘How stylish and bold that that man’s wearing cat-eye glasses — it’s so fun.’ Then Ryan was like, ‘Can I wear cat-eye glasses?’ and I was like, ‘You definitely can,’ and then he had two on.”\n\nThe Red Shoes is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel, or available to rent on Amazon and Apple.\n\nThe Truman Show\n\nYear: 1998\n\nRun time: 1h 43m\n\nDirector: Peter Weir\n\nCast: Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich\n\nPeter Weir’s contemporary existential comedy about a man who discovers that his entire life has been a carefully orchestrated “reality” TV show shares a lot in common with the spirit of Gerwig’s Barbie. “I had to include The Truman Show both because I watched it again before I made this movie, and because Peter Weir very generously got on the phone with me before I started shooting, and he talked to me for a long time about how he shot it and how they made it work.”\n\nThe Truman Show is available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg\n\nYear: 1964\n\nRun time: 1h 31m\n\nDirector: Jacques Demy\n\nCast: Catherine Deneuve, Anne Vernon, Nino Castelnuovo\n\nAs mentioned previously, Jacques Demy was a huge influence on the production design of Gerwig’s Barbie. “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg [is] an amazing movie and astonishingly beautiful,” Gerwig told Letterboxd. “I loved the use of color and the surrealness. Rodrigo Prieto and I — he shot the film and he’s one of the greatest DPs who ever lived — were talking about that layering of the colors and how you’d shoot five different shades of pink or red in one shot and not have it overwhelm anything, that you feel like there’s separation, but that it’s vibrant. Everything feels painterly, and that was a big part of it.”\n\nThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel, or available to rent on Amazon and Apple.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\nYear: 1939\n\nRun time: 1h 42m\n\nDirector: Victor Fleming\n\nCast: Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger\n\nThe iconic 1939 musical fantasy starring Judy Garland is an obvious inspiration for Gerwig’s film about a girl transported to a world beyond her imagination. “In our movie, we have the Pink Brick Road instead of the Yellow Brick Road,” Gerwig told Letterboxd. “We also have beautiful painted backdrops of horizons. We executed it like they would’ve done in the ’30s and ’40s and ’50s soundstage musicals. It was something that we kept returning to. I always love the ending where there’s a ceremonial quality.”\n\nThe Wizard of Oz is available to stream on Max, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nThe Young Girls of Rochefort\n\nYear: 1967\n\nRun time: 2h 5m\n\nDirector: Jacques Demy\n\nCast: Catherine Deneuve, George Chakiris, Françoise Dorléac\n\nJacques Demy’s musical comedy about two extravagantly dressed sisters pining for love was a key influence on Gerwig’s Barbie, particularly for the film’s many flamboyant costume designs. At one point in the film, Barbie sports a hat similar to the sisters’ own.\n\nThe Young Girls of Rochefort is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nTwentieth Century\n\nYear: 1934\n\nRun time: 1h 31m\n\nDirector: Howard Hawks\n\nCast: John Barrymore, Carole Lombard, Walter Connolly\n\nGerwig cites Howard Hawks’ screwball romance Twentieth Century as an influence on Barbie’s heightened sense of emotion-driven comedy. “Margot reminds me of Carole Lombard and Ryan reminds me of John Barrymore in how funny he is. There are scenes where they’re just screaming at each other; I was like, ‘This is perfect.’ There’s a heightened, dramatic thing that John Barrymore does that I showed to Ryan, then he took that and put it in our movie.”\n\nTwentieth Century is available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu.\n\nWings of Desire\n\nYear: 1987\n\nRun time: 2h 8m\n\nDirector: Wim Wenders\n\nCast: Bruno Ganz, Solveig Dommartin, Otto Sander\n\nAmong the wide breadth of Gerwig’s inspirations, Wings of Desire might feel like the oddest film to cite as an inspiration for Barbie. It’s a romantic fantasy about an angel that falls in love with a trapeze artist and renounces his immortality in order to spend the rest of his existence on Earth with her, and Gerwig describes the film as an influence for the simple fact that it features conversations with an angel — and that’s it!\n\nWings of Desire is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel, or available to rent on Amazon and Apple.\n\nWomen on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown\n\nYear: 1988\n\nRun time: 1h 28m\n\nDirector: Pedro Almodóvar\n\nCast: Carmen Maura, Antonio Banderas, Julieta Serrano\n\nPedro Almodóvar’s 1988 black comedy about a television actress who embarks on a journey of self-discovery in order to get to the heart of why her lover left her is commonly referred to as one of the director’s best. In the case of Gerwig’s Barbie, the film was an inspiration for its distinctive set design and method of layering colors on screen.\n\nWomen on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown is available to stream on Freevee, or available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu."

        "text": "It's a Barbie girl summer for economists, too.\n\nMattel's (MAT) famous doll has been everywhere this summer, dominating the box office with the best opening weekend of 2023 and even getting a mention in the Federal Reserve's latest press conference.\n\nBut the story of Barbie's intersection with finance news is about more than the industry's most prominent purple-tied official Jay Powell answering a question about pink attire and Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, because both are proving to be legitimate drivers of a resilient US consumer keeping America out of a recession.\n\n\"These events are getting more highlighted specifically because of the situation we're looking at,\" Bank of America US economist Shruti Mishra told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"Is the consumer going to drop? Is it still resilient? Those questions are the most important questions leading up to any Fed press conference, FOMC meeting, and just generally for the economic outlook.\"\n\nFed Chair Powell, for his part, didn't fully bite last week when asked about the impact of Barbie and Taylor Swift on the US economy. But even he noted it doesn't hurt.\n\n\"The overall resilience of the economy, the fact that we've been able to achieve disinflation so far without any meaningful negative impact on the labor market, the strength of the economy overall, that's a good thing,\" Powell said.\n\n\"It's good to see that, of course. It's also you see consumer confidence coming up and things like that, that will support activity going forward.\"\n\nMargot Robbie attends the European premiere of \"Barbie\" in London, Britain July 12, 2023. (Maja Smiejkowska/REUTERS) (Maja Smiejkowska / reuters)\n\nAnd these aren't just any popular summer events, either.\n\nReports have estimated Swift's Eras Tour could be the first billion-dollar concert tour ever.\n\nMeanwhile, \"Barbenheimer\" — the dual box office hits of \"Barbie\" and Christopher Nolan's biopic \"Oppenheimer\" — combined for the fourth-biggest overall weekend in box office history.\n\nIn the latest release of the Fed's Beige Book, the Philadelphia Fed highlighted Taylor Swift's three-night stop at Lincoln Financial Field as a boost to the local economy.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaylor Swift performs onstage during the Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour at Lincoln Financial Field on May 12, 2023 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (Lisa Lake/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management) (Lisa Lake/TAS23 via Getty Images)\n\n\"Multiple contacts reported that the amount of money guests spend at their leisure destinations declined modestly in recent months,\" the report read.\n\n\"Despite the slowing recovery in tourism in the region overall, one contact highlighted that May was the strongest month for hotel revenue in Philadelphia since the onset of the pandemic, in large part due to an influx of guests for the Taylor Swift concerts in the city.\"\n\nAnalysis from Moody's shows Swift's impact wasn't just a one-off in Philadelphia, either.\n\nMoody's had seen an increase in revenue per available room in every city Swift has stopped in that the firm tracks through its report's publication July 21.\n\nMoody's tracked average revenue per room increases at all four of the cities Taylor Swift stopped at in May. (Moody's Analytics)\n\nAccording to University of Michigan clinical assistant professor of marketing Marcus Collins, it's rare for a movie and concert tour to have this kind of impact.\n\nWith Barbie pink taking over wardrobes and Swift's Eras Tour bracelets dominating social media, the marketing behind both messages have transcended into a cultural moment. And culture, Collins told Yahoo Finance, is the \"most influential external force of human behavior, full stop.\"\n\n\"The salience of (Barbie and the Eras Tour) makes it so that it's undeniable,\" Collins said. \"You can't not talk about it because it's everywhere.\"\n\nJefferies US economist Thomas Simons told Yahoo Finance he hasn't seen anything like the obsession with Barbie and Taylor Swift in his more than 15 years working in economic research.\n\nSimons likens the interest from economists to the rise of social media and the \"casualization\" of economics, which leads to economists being both more aware of pop culture impacts and more willing to look for them.\n\nAnd as economists and researchers alike have turned to the data to look for the impact of these cultural phenomena, the answers have been eye-popping.\n\nIn addition to the findings from Moody's and the Fed, recent data from Bank of America showed card spending on entertainment and clothing both spiked the week of Barbie's release with entertainment sales up about 13%.\n\n\"There's (likely) a Barbie and Oppenheimer effect to play out here,\" Mishra noted.\n\nBank of America saw an increase in card spending the week Barbie and Oppenheimer were released.

        "text": "For some time now, and until further notice, pink means Barbie, whether it’s really about Barbie or not. Ever since the movie about Mattel’s most iconic toy doll began its impressive advertising campaign, the world has been flooded in waves of pink — a tide that has managed to swamp more than just the land of cinema. In the span of merely a few months, we have witnessed the #Barbiecore trend on Tik-Tok, with users creating their own Barbie-inspired outfits and pink-themed aesthetics, and pink-carpet photoshoots taking place around the world with celebrities ransacking the vintage archives of major fashion houses to dress in the spirit of the famous doll. Scores of adoring fans have dug up their most chic and beloved garments from childhood — pink outfits abandoned in adolescence and rediscovered thanks to Barbie — eagerly consuming the advertisements and products launched by Mattel and collaborators, like Barbie lipstick and Ken underwear. And on top of all the pop culture hullabaloo, Barbie has entered the world of politics too: while the right criticizes her for promoting a “woke agenda,” liberals and leftists like Spain’s Second Deputy Prime Minister Yolanda Díaz are flocking to the film and sharing their enthusiasm for Barbie’s feminist agenda on social media.\n\n“Colors are fundamental in marketing and advertising because they’re a very powerful tool for conveying emotions and improving brand recognition,” explains Bego Romero, a digital marketing consultant whose personal website also features pink as the dominant color. “Pink is associated with femininity, sweetness, softness, delicacy, but it’s also true that now, thanks to an excellent marketing campaign that has made the brand very memorable, the image of Barbie pink has emerged, which we immediately associate with the doll. When someone says ‘I bought a Barbie-pink bag’ and you immediately know exactly which tone it is, it speaks to this very strong brand identity, which also expresses an emotional connection: the color will always remind us of childhood,” she says.\n\nProtected by its semantic field of softness and childishness, cushioning its connotations, Barbie pink is also an intense, vibrant and striking color that suggests vitality and passion, and that somehow has become — thanks to the doll, which has always reflected the socio-cultural trends of the time — a signifier of feminine character and strength, a banner of girlboss feminism and, in corporate contexts, a sign of the commitment of brands to liberal progress and social justice. This perception, which implies a tension between continuity (of gender roles, for example) and subversion is also found within, and in the very concept of, Barbie the movie.\n\nThree young girls (Sophie, Ayan and Mia) dressed in pink at the premiere of 'Barbie' in L.A. Jenna Schoenefeld (The Washington Post via Getty Im)\n\nSpeaking to The New Yorker’s Alex Barasch, Greta Gerwig described the sensation of entering Mattel’s headquarters for the first time: It was like the company had shattered, at least cosmetically, her mental image of what a corporation should be (instead of dull and gray, everything was “bright pink” and “very cinematic,” she said). And indeed, many of today’s films and cultural products are now manufactured under a new corporate logic and aesthetic that is more chic and feminine — two qualities practically imprinted on Barbie’s DNA.\n\nPink invites subversion and the breaking of certain corporate conventions, and perhaps even the exploration of excluded identities or inhibitions. But what does this get us, other than a parallel corporate world in pink? “In this sense, Barbie the film is nothing more than a way to revitalize Barbie the doll, to make a marketing niche for her in the post-MeToo liberal feminist world,” argues Pablo Caldera, a Spanish cultural critic. “That other companies, like [fashion retailer] Zara, would take advantage of these same cultural codes seems, to me, a natural step. The film itself inhabits this same world of extreme corporatism, erasing or neutralizing any potential power it might have had to inspire spontaneous or collective forms of association.”\n\nThe pink flood that is sweeping so many of us up is propelled by two main driving forces: nostalgia and virality. Mattel CEO Ynon Kreitz’s stated goal, for the medium term, is to transform the company from a toy manufacturer into a franchise management company — a “pop culture” company. In addition to Barbie, Mattel has announced fourteen other films (Lena Dunham is working on Polly Pocket; J.J. Abrams on Hot Wheels) and 45 more are in “development.” In today’s Hollywood of endless franchises, more and more companies want to play; it’s no longer about making toys and spin-offs from popular movies, but about making movies about pre-existing products. This year alone, we had Ben Affleck’s Air, about the Air Jordan basketball shoe line, and Eva Longoria’s Flamin’ Hot, the origin story of Spicy Cheetos. “People are always going to trust and be drawn to things they’re familiar with,” Romero explains. “What they’re doing with Barbie, and what Hollywood does in general, is playing with people’s emotions: if a consumer has had a good relationship or meaningful experience with a brand, it’s going to be easier for them to want to consume a new version of that same product.”\n\nThe Barbie brand is not the first to transcend the realm of cinema and become a world unto itself, but unlike other cult films, where the collective experience becomes more important than the film itself (such as the 1978 The Rocky Horror Picture Show, where theater-goers go to sing and throw popcorn), Barbie’s popularity preceded the film. In the case of Mean Girls (2004), fans also wore pink (a pink that, incidentally, served to point out the dangers of confusing substance with form; the hypocrisy of the film’s worst protagonists dressed in the sweetest of colors). But in the case of Barbie, fans wear pink to signal our membership in the marketing campaign; what mobilizes us to dress in uniform is the decades-long work of building a magnetic brand identity. It’s popular culture, but a completely manufactured one.\n\nMuñecas de Barbie expuestas durante la semana de la moda de Nueva York en febrero de 2009. TIMOTHY A. CLARY (AFP via Getty Images)\n\n“On the one hand, it seems like a positive development that we’re returning to the question of cinema as a social phenomenon that requires codes of intelligibility that are relatively transparent,” Caldera says. “But it’s also true that something as seemingly benign and casual as the leaking of photos from the film’s shooting, the successive trailers promoting the release, and the exploitation of memes, which are an inherently collective force, are all the result of an extreme form of corporatism, with Marvel being the only other parallel.” For Romero, Barbie’s marketing campaign is one of the best he has seen in recent years: “They’ve managed to combine absolutely everything,” she said.\n\nBarbie’s maximalism permeates both its forms and objectives. From its early stages of conception, the film was conceived as something that would please everyone (or as many people as possible): “If you love Barbie… if you hate Barbie, this movie is for you,” is one of the advertising slogans. This is made all the more evident by the fact that Barbie’s character arc is ultimately less important than Ken’s. The film may have become a social phenomenon, but at its core, it has always and above all been an advertising phenomenon — something that necessarily had to result from compromises between the creative team and Mattel’s corporate representatives. “It’s very interesting, and something you notice when watching the film, because you can clearly see the limits that have been set by the corporation,” Caldera says. “In the beginning, the film plays around with subverting its own origins (‘feminism’ and ‘Mattel’ are mentioned within the first few minutes), but it’s all part of a directed and ultimately homogeneous production. Not taking full advantage of Will Ferrell’s character [a Mattel executive] can only be explained by the film’s own lack of creative and political autonomy from the corporate franchise. It’s as if they were only allowed certain themes, certain jokes, and were prohibited from going too far, from making it into a parody.”\n\nA Zara store's display window shows a Barbie-inspired line of clothing and accessories. SOPA Images (SOPA Images/LightRocket via Gett)\n\nIndeed, Mattel’s CEO has admitted as much, explaining that if the movie had ridiculed Barbie, it would have been disastrous for the brand. “Barbie is aspirational, inspirational — not something you want turned into a parody,” Kreiz told The New Yorker. This is why the company — which in 1997 went so far as to sue M.C.A. Records over Aqua’s song “Barbie Girl,” which nevertheless appears in the film’s trailer — scrapped an earlier proposal for a Barbie movie starring comedian Amy Schumer. The corporation didn’t want satire: “I think the film goes for a soft critique, which is always welcome and necessary, but ultimately it ends up reinforcing the power and updating the image of the company behind it,” Caldera argues.\n\nIn the movie, and despite some initial protests from Mattel’s executives, Gerwig plucks certain failed moments out of the dustbin of the doll’s history, to show that Barbie is not some rigid, conservative monolith, but a fluid and constantly changing signifier. Perhaps, however, in this process of showing, there is also an element of erasure. Hollywood knows that gentle satire is the best way to whitewash (or, should we say, pinkwash) certain trends in cinema with obvious corporate ends, and the implications go well beyond Barbie. Gerwig herself has stated several times that her aspiration is not to become the best director in the world, but to be a great studio director.\n\n“I think this film will put an end to Gerwig’s reputation in independent cinema,” says Caldera, who also points to another crucial issue: “The coincidence of the film’s release with Hollywood’s actors and screenwriters going on strike seems to me a historic opportunity to think collectively about this particular mode of production, which distracts the viewer’s attention and has dominated the discourse from the moment the premiere was announced. It’s not even a spectacle anymore, I don’t think there is even any collective pleasure, just the need to give a nod to the revitalization of certain discourses that we thought we had forgotten. In that sense, Barbie is as nostalgic as any other blockbuster released in 2023, unfortunately. The insistence on generational transference in the film leads to this neutralizing of more radical discourses.”\n\nBarbie dolls inside their characteristic boxes at an auction in London in 2006. Chris Jackson (Getty Images)\n\nHistory in pink\n\nA very important and often forgotten feature of the color pink, explained by Lynn Peril in her book Pink Think: Becoming a Woman in Many Uneasy Lessons, is its power of concealment. While it is often said that pink has always been associated with femininity — and despite the amusing coincidence that the first cultural phenomenon to draw a clear relationship between pink and being a girl was Louisa May Alcott’s 1869 novel Little Women, which Gerwig adapted to film in 2019 — the truth is that it was not until the end of World War II that the color became popular among American women as a sign of returning to a lost domesticity. It was during this era that the first lady of the United States, Mamie Eisenhower, would adopt pink as her signature color, to convey the message that women could hang up their factory overalls, return to the home, and resume their traditional role.\n\nWith Mrs. Eisenhower as its model, the marketing industry began filling American homes with pink. Later, the actress Jayne Mansfield would take the trend to ultimate heights, building a pink palace with a pink Jacuzzi, getting married in a pink wedding dress, dying her dogs pink, and thoroughly consolidating the association between the color and notions of innocuous, obedient femininity. The truth, however, is that even Mansfield herself did not have a genuine connection with pink: she chose the color because she needed a brand of her own, and because she knew it would make her less threatening to her male competitors. The color soon revealed itself as a tool — a way, for example, of appearing more innocent than one truly was. Perhaps this is why pink is now the color of pop culture, and also a tool for filmmakers, like John Waters or Kenneth Anger, who want to subvert the color’s connotations and point to its hidden meanings. In cinema, too, a somewhat darker, more perverse and more interesting story can be drawn from the color pink — the color that hides as much as it shows.\n\nToday, Barbie is washing everything in pink, from social media to store windows, and more than 100 brands are now involved in the production of various absurd, Barbie-themed objects. In Los Angeles, pink Barbie benches have appeared overnight, complete with built-in anti-sleeping dividers to prevent the city’s homeless from using them to rest. Recently, someone on Twitter summed up the situation succinctly: “Heart-warming: this hostile architecture is pink.”"

No — make more movies by and about women!” Park told Rolling Stone adding, “It’s Greta Gerwig!”\n\nRELATED: Greta Gerwig Breaks Global & US Box Office Records For Female Director With ‘Barbie’\n\nGerwig has created the biggest movie for a female director breaking records globally and having Barbie cross $1.184B.

And they happen, but they don’t happen that often. [So] we expect the brand to continue to grow, we expect to have more opportunities in content — and this in not just film, this is television and other areas.”\n\nIn the pipeline, there are movies in development based on Polly Pocket with Lena Dunham writing and directing while Lilly Collins will star, another film based on the American Girl doll and a movie based on Hot Wheels."

        "text": "For thirty-five years, I was at the center of the Barbie universe as a member of Mattel’s design team. It wasn’t a career I had ever envisioned when I was younger, but from that moment in 1962 when I first read Mattel’s advertisement in Women’s Wear Daily, I saw my future, and it thrilled me.\n\nPerhaps that’s because Barbie’s life was the polar opposite of my own: she was the ultimate California girl, while I grew up in Minneapolis, where the winters were gray and seemingly endless. Barbie could take on any profession she desired—she was an astronaut in 1965, four years before the Apollo 11 moon landing—but when I was thinking about a career in the late 1950s, the options available to women largely focused on the “expected” five: nurse, teacher, secretary, shopgirl, and seamstress. I always knew that I wanted more.\n\nOne Sunday while reading the newspaper, I spied an ad for a seminar highlighting jobs in the fashion industry. I put on my best interview clothes and my bravest face, and I didn’t tell anyone where I was going. The first speaker was a member of the Fashion Group International, Inc., who discussed the fashion design program at the Minneapolis School of Art. She put two words together that I had never heard of as a vocation: fashion designer. It was as though someone had turned on a light. Before leaving the seminar, I filled out an application—and when I returned home, I still didn’t tell anyone.\n\nI watched the mailbox every day for weeks until an envelope with my name on it finally arrived: I had been accepted! That feeling of wanting more suddenly no longer made me feel restless; instead, it was exhilarating.\n\nToday the Minneapolis School of Art is known as the Minneapolis College of Art and Design, and in the early 1950s, I was among just 250 students, many of whom were World War II veterans studying on the GI Bill. On most days, I was able to catch a ride with a former GI who decided to study sculpture after he had worked on the restoration of Mount Rushmore. And instead of the sweater-and-skirt combination that had practically become my high school uniform, in college I wore blue jeans most days—just like the guys.\n\nAt the beginning of my senior year of college, a notice was posted that the application process was about to kick off for Mademoiselle magazine’s annual guest-editor contest. While Vogue was considered the epitome of high fashion, Mademoiselle focused more on the lifestyle of smart, independent young women; contributing authors included Joyce Carol Oates and Truman Capote. Meanwhile, the guest-editor program was truly prestigious, with an alumni list that included Sylvia Plath and, from my year, Joan Didion.\n\nEntrants submitted four essays over the course of their senior year; but with more than thirty-seven thousand applicants and only twenty guest editor spaces, did I even have a chance? My first essay won a ten-dollar prize, and I allowed myself to hope. In early May, just prior to graduation, the telegram arrived: “We are delighted to tell you that you have been chosen as a 1955 Guest Editor.”\n\nIn June 1955, instead of walking across the stage to receive my diploma, I’d checked into the legendary Barbizon Hotel for Women in New York City, living and working in a city that was overwhelming, but exciting too. While walking on Fifth Avenue, I found myself always looking up—at the green mansard rooftops of the Pierre and the Plaza, or the art deco edifices of Bonwit Teller and Tiffany & Co.\n\nOur class of twenty talented “mademoiselles” was nothing less than a dreamlike experience. We were invited everywhere: to the home of the famed cosmetics mogul Helena Rubinstein, who devoted an entire room of her penthouse apartment to Salvador Dalí paintings, and to stand at the podium in the General Assembly room at the United Nations, which had opened its headquarters on Manhattan’s East Side just a few years before. We wore our best formals while dancing with West Point cadets in the ballroom on the rooftop of the St. Regis Hotel. And everywhere we went, we were photographed as though we were debutantes or celebrities. It was about as far from Minneapolis as you could get.\n\nEven the work was tinged with glamor. We each had to produce an article for publication, and I asked the magazine’s fashion editor, Kay Silver, if I could interview Pauline Trigère, whose work I appreciated for its combination of innovative construction and clean, chic lines. To my utter delight, Kay granted my wish, and soon enough I was standing with Pauline Trigère in her workroom in the Garment District. It was my first look at a professional design studio, with its large tables for pattern cutting, mannequins for draping (Miss Trigère’s preferred design process), and a live-fit model on standby. I was hooked.\n\nDuring our interview, Miss Trigère (as I always called her) dispensed terrific advice that I still follow: a pretty sketch is only the beginning; a good fashion designer also considers the execution of that design and how the personality of the fabric will play a role. No one element is more important than the others. She also encouraged me to, above all, be true to myself. Throughout my thirty-five years designing for Barbie, I never strayed from this philosophy.\n\nAfter my month in New York, I spent a few years designing first children’s clothing, then “misses sportswear” (the designation for teenage girls then).\n\nWhen I saw the ad in Women’s Wear Daily in November 1962, it didn’t mention Barbie or Mattel; rather, it was a blind ad for a fashion designer stylist, yet I read between the lines and was able to discern both the company and product. Perhaps best of all, two words jumped out at me: Los Angeles. Sunny California suddenly seemed like the perfect change from Milwaukee, and working on Barbie, already the world’s most popular toy, seemed like an irresistible idea. I sent my résumé for consideration, but didn’t receive a response.\n\nIn the meantime, thoughts of Los Angeles continued to beckon. One day, in a pure leap of faith, I decided a move to California was exactly the change I was seeking. I didn’t have a job, but even if Mattel didn’t hire me, I knew Los Angeles was a hub for fashion manufacturers.\n\nBefore I left Milwaukee, I had asked for my mail to be forwarded, but still no word from the company advertising for a fashion designer-stylist. Then one day in 1963, I was sitting at my kitchen table in Los Angeles, reading a trade paper, and I couldn’t believe my eyes: “Barbie Needs a Fashion Designer-Stylist.” The ad listed all the same requirements as the previous blind ad, but this time it was no secret: Mattel needed someone to design for Barbie. Thrilled to learn more about the position, and that it hadn’t been filled, I applied the same day.\n\nAnd soon enough, a response. Actually, make that two responses: At roughly the same time Mattel replied to my submission to the ad in the California paper, my forwarded mail from Milwaukee also arrived, and there was Mattel’s reply to the résumé I had sent after seeing the blind ad in Women’s Wear Daily. Amazingly, both letters included the same request: Could I come in for an interview on April 12 at 11:00 a.m.?\n\nThis was fate, I thought. My decision to move to Los Angeles had paid off.\n\nOn Friday, April 12, 1963, just before 11:00 a.m., I arrived for my interview at Mattel’s California headquarters. I was determined to get this job.\n\nI had two weeks to create a set of test fashions; the dolls should be dressed in my finished designs.\n\nMy interview with Jerry Fire of Mattel’s human resources department was quite brief. He had heard the story of my dueling résumé submissions, and during this process Mattel evidently had decided I was more than qualified for the job. There were just two hurdles to get past: from that same desk drawer, Jerry took out two Barbie dolls, one blond and the other brunette, both sporting the same bubble-cut hairstyle. With them, he handed me a packet of instructions. I had two weeks to create a set of test fashions; the dolls should be dressed in my finished designs, and I needed to present patterns and sketches. “And be sure to keep track of your time, because we’ll pay you for it,” Jerry added.\n\nBack in my apartment, I put the dolls on my kitchen table and spread out the instructions. The first challenge was how different it would be to design for a doll instead of designing for a child or young woman. Barbie had been created on a onesixth scale of the female form, and while the math for creating patterns was easy enough, finding prints suitable for her smaller size could be difficult; even the smallest, most delicate flower on a child’s dress would seem gigantic on an eleven-and-a-half-inch doll. I also had to take into consideration the perception of Barbie as the quintessential California girl. Whatever I designed needed to evoke that ideal.\n\nCompleting the test fashions was merely the first hurdle. My follow-up meeting two weeks later was with the woman who already had become a bona fide legend in the history of Barbie. Charlotte Johnson had been a freelance fashion designer who also taught at what later became known as the California Institute of Arts.\n\nEarly in 1959, Ruth Handler recruited Charlotte to work on her top secret doll project, and she ultimately played an integral role in Barbie’s look. Charlotte was inspired by the runways of Paris and New York, combining that chic aesthetic with the feeling of the California lifestyle to create the twenty-two fashions that comprised Barbie’s 1959 debut wardrobe. Charlotte knew the doll better than almost anyone—except, perhaps, Ruth Handler herself—and she was about to evaluate my designs.\n\nMy first memory of meeting her was that she was very tall and quite stylish. I felt good about my test designs, but in Charlotte’s hands, who could tell? I didn’t say a word as she turned the dolls over and over, closely examining every detail—not just the styles themselves but also the construction, the seaming, even the fabrics I had chosen. After what seemed like an eternity, Charlotte rendered her verdict: “I have no objection to hiring you,” she said, her words revealing no enthusiasm for my designs. And with that, she walked out of the room.\n\nMy first thought: What just happened? Then Jerry Fire was beside me again, escorting me to another room to take a personality and aptitude test, the final step to becoming a Mattel employee in those early years. Once that was complete, he was shaking my hand, a big smile on his face. It took me a moment to realize that I had passed both tests—Charlotte’s and Mattel’s—and had gotten the job. All of a sudden, I was smiling along with Jerry.\n\nThe rest of that day was like a dream in which I sort of floated along. I couldn’t stop grinning, because I had achieved exactly what that second ad had asked for: I was a fashion designer-stylist for Barbie.\n\nPeople talk about fate as an abstract idea, but in that moment, I fully embraced what it meant. The two advertisements I’d responded to had serendipitously asked me to come in and interview on the same day at the same time. How could that not be destiny?\n\n__________________________________\n\nFrom the book DRESSING BARBIE by Carol Spencer. Copyright © 2023 by Carol Spencer.

The actress, who also went by “La Doña” and “Maria Bonita,” was one of Mexico’s biggest starlets in the 1940s and ’50s.\n\nAvailable to purchase Wednesday at noon on the Mattel Creations site, the limited-edition doll retails for $40.\n\nMaría Félix’s Barbie Mattel\n\nDesigned by Carlyle Nuera, Félix’s Barbie features a custom face mold modeled after her likeness, highlighting her trademark sharp cheekbones and arched eyebrows. The doll wears a strapless gold evening gown wrapped in sheer black fabric, which matches her neck scarf. Other accessories include opera gloves and oversize chandelier earrings. A certificate of authenticity and a stand also come with the doll.\n\n“An incomparable beauty with ambition, intelligence, drive and a social conscience, María Félix was a Mexican movie star whose performances in international films captivated audiences across the world,” Mattel’s description reads.\n\nThroughout her career, Félix starred in 47 films. Many of these were produced in Mexico, though some were also made in Spain, Italy, Argentina and France.\n\nFélix was also renowned for her style, having been dressed by a variety of high-profile designers including Christian Dior, Givenchy, Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel and Balenciaga. The actress also had an extensive collection of Cartier jewels, some of which she commissioned. Félix passed away in 2002 at the age of 88.\n\nThe Barbie Tribute collection has honored several trailblazing women with their own dolls. Mattel has released Barbies modeled after Ella Fitzgerald, Laverne Cox, Lucille Ball and Vera Wang as part of the limited-edition series."

        "text": "The “Barbie” movie has proved itself a box-office sensation, taking in $155 million on its opening weekend.\n\nBut can the “Barbie” collectibles market see as big a boom? Some experts say the surge is already happening — in particular for the doll they refer to as the holy grail of Barbies. As in Barbie No. 1, the first doll ever released by Mattel to bear the Barbie name, dating from 1959.\n\nBarbie fanatics speak of it in reverent terms. “I lost sleep over this doll,” one collector said in a YouTube GOOG, -1.31% GOOGL, -1.42% video that documented the arrival and unboxing of a Barbie No. 1.\n\nNeedless to say, collectors will pay a pretty penny for a Barbie No. 1. Prices can easily reach $10,000-plus, according to Barbie experts. The original doll sold for about $3, but there’s a Barbie No. 1 doll on eBay EBAY, -0.46% currently going for $25,000.\n\nBut before you plunk down five figures for an investment-grade doll, we figured you might want to know a little more about this one-of-a-kind Barbie. Here goes:\n\nRelated: AMC had its busiest weekend since 2019, boosted by ‘Barbie’ and ‘Oppenheimer’\n\nWhat makes the ‘Holy Grail’ Barbie so special?\n\nObviously, it’s all about being the first of its kind, not unlike a baseball player’s rookie card (the 1952 Mickey Mantle card is often considered the holy grail of sports collectibles, though that can sell for millions of dollars). It’s also about rarity. Experts say around 300,000 to 350,000 of those debut Barbies were sold in 1959, but the number of Barbie No. 1s that survived throughout the years — dolls are sold as toys, after all, not necessarily collectibles — is considerably less.\n\n(Mattel MAT, -1.05% reportedly now releases about 60 million Barbies annually, but the company didn’t respond to a MarketWatch request for comment and information.)\n\nThere’s also something to be said for No. 1’s distinct look, marked by what veteran Barbie appraiser Dr. Lori Verderame describes as its “deep profile” with a protruding nose and high forehead. It’s a design very much inspired by the German-made Bild Lilli dolls that intrigued Barbie creator Ruth Handler.\n\nAre there any really rare examples of the original Barbie?\n\nRed-headed Barbie No. 1s are known to exist. Marl Davidson, a Barbie dealer based in Bradenton, Fla., says she once sold one for $50,000, and perhaps the holiest of holy grails is a salesman’s Barbie sample case dating from the doll’s early years. Davidson says she believes only two or three are around. And one surfaced? “It could go for $1 million,” she says.\n\nAnd what makes some Barbie No. 1s more valuable than others?\n\nAs with almost any collectible category, it’s all about condition. Barbie buyers are looking for a No. 1 that’s as close to mint condition as possible, with all the original items — namely, the box, black stand, sunglasses, shoes, brochure and zebra-striped swimsuit. (There are also outfits and accessories dating from Barbie’s early years, but these were sold separately; Verderame says a popular outfit from this period can sell for $150 to $200.)\n\nIronically, if the Barbie has stayed in the original box, it may affect the condition — Verderame explains that the packaging is acidic so it can “damage the piece over time,” but she says collectors still “want it in the box.”\n\nThen, there’s the hair color. The original Barbie came in both blonde and brunette versions. Verderame says the blondes are generally more sought after since that’s what most people think of as the Barbie classic. But Davidson says brunettes can actually have value since there were fewer made of them. Then again, she says, the collectors “who can afford it will have one of everything.”\n\nHow can you tell if a first-edition 1959 Barbie is a fake?\n\nThere are various elements that will signify an original Barbie — most notably, a marking on the doll’s, um, right buttock (this also applies to later Barbies, though). Also look for holes in the feet and what the Doll Reference site describes as “tight curly bangs,” among other identifiers. It’s worth keeping in mind that you might find an original No. 1 doll, but with other parts that are not original — say, a replacement stand.\n\nWhat’s the current market for the original Barbie?\n\nIt’s soaring because of the movie, Verderame says. She notes that Barbie No. 1s that went for $10,000 as recently as three months ago are now selling in the $15,000-$25,000 range. Verderame anticipates the market will cool off after the fervor for the Warner Bros. WBD, +6.01% film dies down. But Davidson remains bullish on Barbie’s longer-term prospects because of the doll’s iconic appeal: “The price can only go up,” she says.\n\nAre there any affordable alternatives to a first-edition Barbie?\n\nDavidson says collectors can also consider Barbie No. 3 as a collectible. It’s a very early model, but it has a far more approachable price — Davidson says collectors can find one between $1,000 and $3,000.\n\nIf you want something way more affordable that still has potential to appreciate, Verderame says to consider iconic Barbies from the 1990s and 2000s that are currently selling for between $50 and $150.\n\nBut if you insist on a Barbie No. 1, Davidson says you can always buy one in lesser condition for a lesser price. Still, even a bald Barbie No. 1 won’t come cheap, she warns. “It’s going to go for a couple of grand,” she says."

I asked Mattel to tell me the most popular Barbie costume of the last five years and they told me it was a Barbie in a yellow dress. It turned out that it probably wouldn't be recognizable if I did an iteration of it.\"\n\nNot all of Robbie's looks, then, take inspiration from the Mattel toy line — but here are six outfits that do."
