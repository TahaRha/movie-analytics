****************************Data Analysis:****************************

-have: jsons of titles of articles about barbie and other movies (2 other movies should be okay) (around 500+ articles)

-will assume the content of the article can be summarized by their titles. (might need actual contents of articles for ~200 articles and the openings/descriptions? for the remaining articles)

-parse through authors of articles and add supposed gender column

-Asked:

1. What aspect of the movie was the focus (topic) of the article
2. How much coverage the movie received relative to other movies that came out at a similar time

-Result:

for 1. develop some kind of aspects of the movie list, and use word frequency to determine most popular aspects of the movie discussed on articles. â€œCharacterize your topics by computing the 10 words in each category with the highest tf-idf scores (to compute inverse document frequency, use all 500 posts that you originally collected) homework 10 could be helpful

for 2., quantitative analysis using a normalized ratio (normal distribution) of total articles collected and how popular was it compared to other movies in the dataset. 

-Should I use statistical or network analysis? 

**Results:**

Are all results requested present?

Do the results make sense? 

Are outliers or unusual trends appropriately explained?

******************Findings:******************

Are insightful interpretations provided?

Are these grounded in results?

Do the findings integrate results and prior knowledge in a sound, well-reasoned way?

Takeaway: should help teammates for data collection in order to direct my analysis and perfect it.


*********************Remarks********************

Analyze intersections between all 3 movies, mention of other movies in some articles, etc.

Substantial probelm (titles are litteraly the same as descriptions)
